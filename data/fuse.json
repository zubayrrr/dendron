Stored on [Github Repository](https://github.com/zubayrrr/dendron) and hosted on [Netlify](https://netlify.com) for free.\n\n## Principles\n\n### All notes should be relative to me.\n\n- All notes in principle are written for me; what I know about a subject, how I feel about a particular thing.\n- Opinions are fine as long as I feel strong epistemic confidence in the given opinion.\n- Don't over explain a note if it's not necessary, remember, these notes are for you and are relative to whatever knowledge you posses about the subject.\n- Read books and make an dedicated notes for them.\n- Listen podcasts but capture them inside a \"subject specific\" note or \"Map of Concept\" note or a note tagged #areas. Because making notes from podcasts can be tedious as they're not as well structured as books for consumption.(Whose merit is debatable.)\n- #areas are basically \"Map of Concept\" notes but I have recently come to the realization that its better to maintain them [Nikita Voloboev style](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/) but with heavy usage of transclusion and backlinking.\n  - \"Resources\" should be first processed and then mentioned inside the note, otherwise they should be left in inbox.\n\n### Gotta capture 'em all\n\n- Hog whatever information tickles your pickle([anything that gratifies one's intellectual curiosity](https://news.ycombinator.com/newsguidelines.html)).\n- [[swipes]] are interesting/useful bits of... [[quotes|swipes.quotes]], [[excerpts|swipes.excerpts]], [[sayings|swipes.sayings]], [[phrases|swipes.phrases]]. Essentially, ideas, opinions that are swiped off from [[others|resources.people]].\n- Make no distinction between \"your\" ideas and ideas of \"others\", because if you vibe with an idea; it's already yours.\n- But also remember \"If you've time to consume, you've time to produce.\".\n- Use [raindrop.io](https://raindrop.io) to manage your URL bookmarks.\n- If you need to bookmark a webpage or an article all together, use [MarkDownload](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/markdownload-markdown-web/pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi?hl=en-GB) to rip the entire page. Let's call it a [[webmark|inbox.webmark]]; it belong in the `/inbox`.\n- Similar process is employed for capturing tweets using [tweet-to-markdown](https://github.com/kbravh/tweet-to-markdown) and it also belongs in the `/inbox`.\n\n### Don't force evolution\n\n- Let your second brain evolve at it's own pace.\n- The structure should never be _too_ rigid because its meant to take form by itself.\n\n### Noise & Signal\n\n- While capturing ideas left and right is recommended, make sure you're not harming your periods of focus.\n- Have impenetrable focus periods (use Pomodoro method) where you only care about the work on hand and nothing else.\n\n### Why do any of this?\n\n- Because I can't remember everything - there's a lot of information around that interests me and there isn't enough working memory installed in me.\n- So, I make notes - to remember, to create, to meditate, to think.\n- A bodybuilder's portfolio is their body - my portfolio is my wiki.\n- Not only am I making - whatever I know - tangible by writing it down. I know exactly where to look if I ever forget something.\n- I am at the beginning of my learning adventures. When I look back at it, I will know where I came from and how my thoughts evolved over time.\n- Plus, its really fun to nerd out.\n\n## Structure of this wiki\n\n- [[slipbox.Ontology]] explains the structure of this wiki and the tags, backlinks used in it.\n- Dendron takes care of the structure and hierarchy(mostly), but I insist on using tags for backwards compatibility.\n\n## Quicklinks\n\n- [[About me|archive.about]]\n- [Github](https://github.com/zubayrrr)\n- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/zoobhalu)\n- [Blog](https://zubayrali.in)\n- [Guestbook](https://www.yourworldoftext.com/~zubayrali/)\n","n":0.043}}},{"i":2,"$":{"0":{"v":"Workbench","n":1},"1":{"v":"\n[[resources.books.The Defining Decade]]\n[[swipes.quotes.Adults don’t emerge They’re made]]\n[[swipes.quotes.We are born not all at once, but by bits]]\n[[resources.people.Erik Erikson]]\n[[swipes.quotes.Yes is how you get your first job]]\n[[archive.weak ties]]\n","n":0.2}}},{"i":3,"$":{"0":{"v":"Tags","n":1}}},{"i":4,"$":{"0":{"v":"Zubayr","n":1}}},{"i":5,"$":{"0":{"v":"Webmark","n":1}}},{"i":6,"$":{"0":{"v":"Videos","n":1}}},{"i":7,"$":{"0":{"v":"TIL","n":1}}},{"i":8,"$":{"0":{"v":"Tidbits","n":1}}},{"i":9,"$":{"0":{"v":"Takeaways","n":1}}},{"i":10,"$":{"0":{"v":"Spanish","n":1}}},{"i":11,"$":{"0":{"v":"Sayings","n":1}}},{"i":12,"$":{"0":{"v":"Sanskrit","n":1}}},{"i":13,"$":{"0":{"v":"Rationality","n":1}}},{"i":14,"$":{"0":{"v":"Quotes","n":1}}},{"i":15,"$":{"0":{"v":"Proverbs","n":1}}},{"i":16,"$":{"0":{"v":"Principles","n":1},"1":{"v":"\n# Principles I live by.

Schopenhauer calls this as \"perversion\".\n\n> And so it is that education perverts the mind; and this is why, after a long spell of learning and reading, we enter the world, in our youth, with view that are partly simple, partly perverted...This is because our head is full of ideas which we're now trying to make use of, but almost always apply wrongly.\n\n- The teacher is busy trying to cram ideas inside the children's mind instead of teaching them how to think in the first place; this causes children to grow up with ideas they learned from hearsay and opinions and are left unarmed to deal with situations in the real world(out of the textbook).\n- The children are submerged in a web of ideas based on opinions and prejudice; they grow up to find this conflicting with the real world, they face a cognitive dissonance and due to them never being taught how to change their opinions in the light of new evidence or facts they lash out against the world or the idea of it that was created for them in childhood.\n\n> He has never attempted to abstract fundamental ideas from his own observations and experience, because he has got everything ready-made from other people; and it is for this very reason that he and countless others are so insipid and shallow.\n\n- Even if they're taught objectively correct things, they don't fully understand why they're so.\n- Schopenhauer puts a lot of importance in teaching children words and making sure they understand what those words really mean.\n\n> ...One must next take care that children do not use words with which they connect no clear meaning. Even children have, as a rule, that unhappy tendency of being satisfied with words instead of wishing to understand things, and of learning words by heart, so that they may make use of them when they're in a difficulty. This tendency clings to them afterwards, so that the knowledge of many learned men becomes mere verbosity.\n\n- Schopenhauer also proposes that before the age of sixteen children should only be taught things and subjects in which objective errors are possible(eg: Maths and Linguistics) and they shouldn't be taught things in which objective errors are not possible, matters of opinions, religion, philosophy et cetera.\n- Schopenhauer says this because he believes before the age of sixteen the faculty of judgement is not fully developed in a human, which makes it hard for him to make opinions of his own about matters as intricate as religion and philosophy thus he is also easily influenced if a ready-made answer is given to him.\n- Schopenhauer believes history must be taught but only stuff like dates and names of places and people...the added benefit of this is that since our memory is sharpest in our youth it behooves that we prioritize learning those things.

He qualified as a doctor of medicine in 1881 at the University of Vienna. Upon completing his habilitation in 1885, he was appointed a docent in neuropathology and became an affiliated professor in 1902. Freud lived and worked in Vienna, having set up his clinical practice there in 1886. In 1938, Freud left Austria to escape Nazi persecution. He died in exile in the United Kingdom in 1939.In founding psychoanalysis, Freud developed therapeutic techniques such as the use of free association and discovered transference, establishing its central role in the analytic process. Freud's redefinition of sexuality to include its infantile forms led him to formulate the Oedipus complex as the central tenet of psychoanalytical theory. His analysis of dreams as wish-fulfillments provided him with models for the clinical analysis of symptom formation and the underlying mechanisms of repression. On this basis, Freud elaborated his theory of the unconscious and went on to develop a model of psychic structure comprising id, ego and super-ego. Freud postulated the existence of libido, sexualised energy with which mental processes and structures are invested and which generates erotic attachments, and a death drive, the source of compulsive repetition, hate, aggression, and neurotic guilt. In his later works, Freud developed a wide-ranging interpretation and critique of religion and culture.Though in overall decline as a diagnostic and clinical practice, psychoanalysis remains influential within psychology, psychiatry, and psychotherapy, and across the humanities. It thus continues to generate extensive and highly contested debate concerning its therapeutic efficacy, its scientific status, and whether it advances or hinders the feminist cause. Nonetheless, Freud's work has suffused contemporary Western thought and popular culture. W. H. Auden's 1940 poetic tribute to Freud describes him as having created \"a whole climate of opinion / under whom we conduct our different lives\". \n> - via [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigmund%20Freud)\n","n":0.052}}},{"i":390,"$":{"0":{"v":"Sam Harris","n":0.707},"1":{"v":"\n- `Keywords:` [[areas.philosophy]], [[areas.neuroscience]], [[Rationality]], [[Religion]]\n- `Profession:`\n- `Connection Points:`\n\n---\n\nSamuel Benjamin Harris (born April 9, 1967) is an American philosopher, neuroscientist, author, and podcast host.

He was one of the dominant figures of post-war Western classical music.\n>\n> Born in Montbrison in the Loire department of France, the son of an engineer, Boulez studied at the Conservatoire de Paris with Olivier Messiaen, and privately with Andrée Vaurabourg and René Leibowitz. He began his professional career in the late 1940s as music director of the Renaud-Barrault theatre company in Paris. He was a leading figure in avant-garde music, playing an important role in the development of integral serialism (in the 1950s), controlled chance music (in the 1960s) and the electronic transformation of instrumental music in real time (from the 1970s onwards). His tendency to revise earlier compositions meant that his body of work was relatively small, but it included pieces regarded by many as landmarks of twentieth-century music, such as Le Marteau sans maître, Pli selon pli and Répons. His uncompromising commitment to modernism and the trenchant, polemical tone in which he expressed his views on music led some to criticise him as a dogmatist.\n>\n> Alongside his activities as a composer, Boulez was one of the most prominent conductors of his generation. In a career lasting more than sixty years, he was music director of the New York Philharmonic and the Ensemble intercontemporain, chief conductor of the BBC Symphony Orchestra and principal guest conductor of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and the Cleveland Orchestra. He made frequent appearances with many other orchestras, including the Vienna Philharmonic, the Berlin Philharmonic and the London Symphony Orchestra. He was known for his performances of the music of the first half of the twentieth century—including Debussy and Ravel, Stravinsky and Bartók, and the Second Viennese School—as well as that of his contemporaries, such as Ligeti, Berio and Carter. His work in the opera house included the Jahrhundertring—the production of Wagner's Ring cycle for the centenary of the Bayreuth Festival—and the world premiere of the three-act version of Alban Berg's Lulu. His recorded legacy is extensive.\n>\n> He founded several musical institutions: the Domaine musical, Institut de recherche et coordination acoustique/musique (IRCAM), Ensemble intercontemporain and Cité de la Musique in Paris, and the Lucerne Festival Academy in Switzerland.\n>\n> [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre%20Boulez)\n","n":0.05}}},{"i":396,"$":{"0":{"v":"Nassim Nicholas Taleb","n":0.577},"1":{"v":"\n- `Keywords:`\n- `Profession:`\n- `Connection Points:`\n\n---\n\n> **Nassim Nicholas Taleb** (; alternatively Nessim or Nissim; born 1960)  is a Lebanese-American essayist, mathematical statistician, former option trader, risk analyst, and aphorist whose work concerns problems of randomness, probability, and uncertainty.

His first novel, Go Tell It On The Mountain, was published in 1953; decades later, Time Magazine included the novel on its list of the 100 best English-language novels released from 1923 to 2005. \n\nHis first essay collection, Notes of a Native Son, was published in 1955.Baldwin's work fictionalizes fundamental personal questions and dilemmas amid complex social and psychological pressures. Themes of masculinity, sexuality, race, and class intertwine to create intricate narratives that run parallel with some of the major political movements toward social change in mid-twentieth century America, such as the civil rights movement and the gay liberation movement. Baldwin's protagonists are often but not exclusively African American, and gay and bisexual men frequently feature prominently in his literature. These characters often face internal and external obstacles in their search for social and self-acceptance. Such dynamics are prominent in Baldwin's second novel, Giovanni's Room, which was written in 1956, well before the gay liberation movement.His reputation has endured since his death and his work has been adapted for the screen to great acclaim. An unfinished manuscript, Remember This House, was expanded and adapted for cinema as the documentary film I Am Not Your Negro (2016), which was nominated for Best Documentary Feature at the 89th Academy Awards. One of his novels, If Beale Street Could Talk, was adapted into the Academy Award-winning film of the same name in 2018, directed and produced by Barry Jenkins.In addition to writing, Baldwin was also a well-known, and controversial, public figure and orator, especially during the civil rights movement in the United States. \n> - via [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James%20Baldwin)\n","n":0.058}}},{"i":408,"$":{"0":{"v":"Ikkyū","n":1},"1":{"v":"\n- `Keywords:` [[areas.buddhism]], [[Zen]]\n- `Profession:`\n- `Connection Points:`\n\n---\n\n**Ikkyū** (一休宗純, Ikkyū Sōjun, 1394–1481) was an eccentric, iconoclastic Japanese Zen Buddhist monk and poet.

Taught by Plato, he was the founder of the Lyceum, the Peripatetic school of philosophy, and the Aristotelian tradition. His writings cover many subjects including physics, biology, zoology, metaphysics, logic, ethics, aesthetics, poetry, theatre, music, rhetoric, psychology, linguistics, economics, politics, meteorology, geology and government. Aristotle provided a complex synthesis of the various philosophies existing prior to him. It was above all from his teachings that the West inherited its intellectual lexicon, as well as problems and methods of inquiry. As a result, his philosophy has exerted a unique influence on almost every form of knowledge in the West and it continues to be a subject of contemporary philosophical discussion.Little is known about his life. Aristotle was born in the city of Stagira in Northern Greece. His father, Nicomachus, died when Aristotle was a child, and he was brought up by a guardian. At seventeen or eighteen years of age he joined Plato's Academy in Athens and remained there until the age of thirty-seven (c. 347 BC). Shortly after Plato died, Aristotle left Athens and, at the request of Philip II of Macedon, tutored Alexander the Great beginning in 343 BC. He established a library in the Lyceum which helped him to produce many of his hundreds of books on papyrus scrolls. Though Aristotle wrote many elegant treatises and dialogues for publication, only around a third of his original output has survived, none of it intended for publication.Aristotle's views profoundly shaped medieval scholarship. The influence of physical science extended from Late Antiquity and the Early Middle Ages into the Renaissance, and were not replaced systematically until the Enlightenment and theories such as classical mechanics were developed. Some of Aristotle's zoological observations found in his biology, such as on the hectocotyl (reproductive) arm of the octopus, were disbelieved until the 19th century. He also influenced Judeo-Islamic philosophies (800–1400) during the Middle Ages, as well as Christian theology, especially the Neoplatonism of the Early Church and the scholastic tradition of the Catholic Church. Aristotle was revered among medieval Muslim scholars as \"The First Teacher\", and among medieval Christians like Thomas Aquinas as simply \"The Philosopher\", while the poet Dante called him “the master of those who know\". His works contain the earliest known formal study of logic, and were studied by medieval scholars such as Peter Abelard and John Buridan.Aristotle's influence on logic continued well into the 19th century. In addition, his ethics, though always influential, gained renewed interest with the modern advent of virtue ethics.Aristotle has been called \"the father of logic\", \"the father of biology\", \"the father of political science\", \"the father of zoology\", \"the father of embryology\", \"the father of natural law\", \"the father of scientific method\", \"the father of rhetoric\", \"the father of psychology\", \"the father of realism\", \"the father of criticism\", \"the father of individualism\", \"the father of teleology\", and \"the father of meteorology\".\n\n> - via [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotle)\n","n":0.044}}},{"i":427,"$":{"0":{"v":"APJ Abdul Kalam","n":0.577}}},{"i":428,"$":{"0":{"v":"Anne-Laure Le Cunff","n":0.577},"1":{"v":"\n- `Keywords:` \n- `Profession:`\n- `Connection Points:`\n\n---\n","n":0.408}}},{"i":429,"$":{"0":{"v":"Aldous Huxley","n":0.707}}},{"i":430,"$":{"0":{"v":"Albert Camus","n":0.707}}},{"i":431,"$":{"0":{"v":"Aaron Hillel Swartz","n":0.577},"1":{"v":"\n# Aaron Schwartz\n\n- Keywords: [[areas.Computer Science]]\n- Profession:\n- Connection Points:\n\n---\n\n**Aaron Hillel Swartz** (November 8, 1986 – January 11, 2013) was an American computer programmer, entrepreneur, writer, political organizer, and Internet hacktivist.

He founded the online group Demand Progress, known for its campaign against the Stop Online Piracy Act.In 2011, Swartz was arrested by Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) police on state breaking-and-entering charges, after connecting a computer to the MIT network in an unmarked and unlocked closet, and setting it to download academic journal articles systematically from JSTOR using a guest user account issued to him by MIT. Federal prosecutors, led by Carmen Ortiz, later charged him with two counts of wire fraud and eleven violations of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, carrying a cumulative maximum penalty of $1 million in fines, 35 years in prison, asset forfeiture, restitution, and supervised release. Swartz declined a plea bargain under which he would have served six months in federal prison. Two days after the prosecution rejected a counter-offer by Swartz, he was found dead by suicide in his Brooklyn apartment. In 2013, Swartz was inducted posthumously into the Internet Hall of Fame.\n\n> - via [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron%20Swartz)\n","n":0.056}}},{"i":432,"$":{"0":{"v":"Wang Jian","n":0.707},"1":{"v":"\n- Areas: [[areas.computer science]]\n\n---\n\nWang Jian (Chinese: 王坚; born October 1962) is a Chinese computer scientist currently serving as chief technology officer of Alibaba Group.

We indulge in wishful thinking. We cherry-pick evidence that confirms our prejudices and supports our political tribe.\n\nScout mindset is what you need to stop fooling yourself, to confront the truth, it's not something you've not been doing, in fact you might have found yourself questioning your choices, your mistakes but we don't do it as much as we should be doing.\n\nKnowing _how to reason_ isn't a cure-all, just like knowing the importance of exercising isn't going to make you healhty. Unless you acknowledge your biases and fallacies in your thinking and put in conscious effort to fight them off.\n\n> Our judgment isn’t limited by knowledge nearly as much as it’s limited by attitude. - Julia Galef\n\n- The Truth isn't in conflict with your other goals.\n- Learn tools that make it easier to see clearly.\n- eg: outsider test, the selective skeptic test, the conformity test, introspection techniques\n- Appreciating the emotional rewards of scout mindset.\n\nScout mindset is rewarding in the sense that it allows us to be open minded no matter the situation we're in, there's equanimity that results from understanding risk and coming to terms with the odds you’re facing. And there’s a refreshing lightness in the feeling of being free to explore ideas and follow the evidence wherever it leads, unconstrained by what you’re “supposed to” think.\n\nIt's a different way of being, one that’s rooted in an appetite for truth, and one that’s both useful and fulfilling\n\nTo be willing to consider other interpretations—to even believe that there could be other reasonable interpretations besides your own—requires scout mindset.\n\n---\n\nThe opposite of [directionally-motivated-reasoning](#directionally-motivated-reasoning) is [accuracy-motivated-reasoning](#accuracy-motivated-reasoning)\n\n---\n\n1.  1.

We make unconscious trade-offs\n\nWe trade off between judgment and belonging. If you live in a tight-knit community, it might be easier to fit in if you use soldier mindset to fight off any doubts you have about your community’s core beliefs and values. On the other hand, if you do allow yourself to entertain those doubts, you might realize you’re better off rejecting your community’s views on morality, religion, or gender roles, and deciding to live a less traditional life.\n\n\\- We trade off between judgment and persuasion.\n\\- We trade off between judgment and morale.\n\\- When you come up with a plan, focusing only on its positives (“This is such a great idea\\!”) can help you work up enthusiasm and motivation to carry it out. On the other hand, if you scrutinize your plan for flaws (“What are the downsides? How might this fail?”), you’re more likely to notice if there’s a better plan you should switch to instead.\n\nWe make these trade-offs, and many more, all the time, usually without even realizing we’re doing so. After all, the whole point of self-deception is that it’s occurring beneath our conscious awareness. If you were to find yourself thinking, explicitly, “Should I admit to myself that I screwed up?” the issue would already be moot. So it’s left up to our unconscious minds to choose, on a case-by-case basis, which goals to prioritize. Sometimes we choose soldier mindset, furthering our emotional or social goals at the expense of accuracy. Sometimes we choose scout mindset, seeking out the truth even if it turns out not to be what we were hoping for.\n\nAnd sometimes our unconscious minds attempt to have it both ways, our desire to protect our self-esteem and happiness can be in competition with our desire to learn about problems we're facing(so that We can fix them)\n\n1.  1.  Are we rationally irrational?\n\nThe hypothesis that the human mind evolved the ability to make these trade-offs well is called the rational irrationality hypothesis, if the name sounds like a paradox, that’s because it’s using two different senses of the word rational:[espistemic-rationality](#espistemic-rationality) means holding beliefs that are well justified, while [instrumental-rationality](#instrumental-rationality) means acting effectively to achieve your goals.\n\nBeing rationally irrational, therefore, would mean that we’re good at unconsciously choosing just enough epistemic irrationality to achieve our social and emotional goals, without impairing our judgment too much. A rationally irrational person would deny problems only when the comfort of denial is sufficiently high and their chance of fixing the problem is sufficiently low.\n\nSo, are we rationally irrational?\n\nwe’re far from rationally irrational. There are several major biases in our decision-making, several ways in which we systematically misjudge the costs and benefits of truth.\nOur biases cause us to overvalue soldier mindset, choosing it more often than we should, and undervalue scout mindset, choosing it less often than we should.\n\n1.  1.  We overvalue the immediate rewards of solider mindset\n\nOne of the most frustrating aspects of being human is our knack for undermining our own goals.\n\nThe source of this self-sabotage is present bias, a feature of our intuitive decision-making in which we care too much about short-term consequences and too little about long-term consequences. In other words, we’re impatient, and we get more impatient as the potential rewards grow closer.\n\nWhen you contemplate a gym membership, the trade-off seems well worth it, in theory. Spend a few hours per week exercising, in exchange for looking and feeling a lot better? Sign me up\\! But on any given morning, when you’re faced with the choice between “Turn off my alarm and sink blissfully back into sleep” or “Head to the gym and make an imperceptible amount of progress toward my fitness goals,” it’s a much tougher call. The rewards of choosing to sleep in are immediate; the rewards of choosing to exercise are diffuse and delayed. What difference will one exercise session make to your long-term fitness goals, anyway?\n\nIt’s widely known that present bias shapes our choices about how to act. What’s much less appreciated is that it also shapes our choices about how to think. Just like sleeping in, breaking your diet, or procrastinating on your work, we reap the rewards of thinking in soldier mindset right away, while the costs don’t come due until later. If you’re worried about a mistake you made and you convince yourself that “It wasn’t my fault,” you’re rewarded with a hit of instant emotional relief. The cost is that you miss out on learning from your mistake, which means you’re less able to prevent it from happening again. But that won’t affect you until some unknown point in the future.\n\nBeing overly optimistic about your chance of success gives you a burst of motivation right away. But those motivational benefits dwindle over time, or even backfire, when success takes longer than you predicted. As Francis Bacon said, “Hope is a good breakfast, but a bad supper.”\n\n1.  1.  We underestimate the value of building scout habits\n\nWhen you wake up in the morning and head to the gym, the benefit of that choice isn’t just in the calories you burn or the muscle tone you develop that day. The benefit also lies in the fact that you’re reinforcing valuable skills and habits. That includes the habit of going to the gym, obviously, but also the broader skill of doing hard things, and the broader habit of following through on your promises to yourself.\n\nAny single day, on its own, doesn’t make much difference to your overall habits and skills. “I can just go tomorrow,” you think as you turn off the alarm. Which is true—but of course, you’ll think the same thing tomorrow.\n\nEven when you’re reasoning about something like foreign politics that doesn’t impact your life directly, the way you think still impacts you indirectly, because you’re reinforcing general habits of thought. Every time you say, “Oh, that’s a good point, I hadn’t thought of that,” it gets a little bit easier for you to acknowledge good points in general. Every time you opt to check a fact before citing it, you become a little bit more likely to remember to check your facts in general. Every time you’re willing to say, “I was wrong,” it gets a little bit easier to be wrong in general.\n\nIt’s hard for the “Incrementally improve my thinking habits” benefit to compete with the vivid and immediate rewards of soldier mindset.\n\n1.  1.  we underestimate the ripple effects of self-deception\n\nWhen you tell a lie, it’s hard to predict exactly what you’ve committed your future self to.\n\nJust like the lies we tell others, the lies we tell ourselves have ripple effects. Suppose you tend to rationalize away your own mistakes, and consequently you see yourself as more perfect than you really are. This has a ripple effect on your views of other people: Now, when your friends and family screw up, you might not be very sympathetic. After all, you never make such mistakes. Why can’t they just be better? It’s not that hard.\n\nOr suppose that for the sake of your self-esteem, you view yourself through rose-colored glasses, judging yourself to be more charming, interesting, and impressive than you actually appear to other people. Here’s one possible ripple effect: How do you explain the fact that women don’t seem to be interested in dating you, given what a great catch you are? Well, maybe they’re all shallow.\n\nIt’s hard to know exactly how the ripple effect of a particular act of self-deception will hurt you in the future, or if it will at all. Perhaps in many instances the harm is negligible. But the fact that the harm is delayed and unpredictable should ring an alarm bell. This is exactly the kind of cost we tend to neglect when we’re intuitively weighing costs and benefits. Ripple effects are yet more reason to suspect that we underestimate the cost of deceiving ourselves—and are therefore choosing soldier mindset too often and scout mindset not often enough.\n\n1.  1.  We overestimate social costs\n\nAnother way in which our intuition about costs and benefits is skewed—we overestimate the importance of how we come across to other people. Social costs like looking weird or making a fool out of ourselves feel a lot more significant than they actually are. In reality, other people aren’t thinking about you nearly as much as you intuitively think they are, and their opinions of you don’t have nearly as much impact on your life as it feels like they do.\n\nAs a result, we end up making tragic trade-offs, sacrificing a lot of potential happiness to avoid relatively small social costs.\n\nWhen we allow ourselves to reflect on a social cost we’ve been avoiding (or when someone else prompts us to reflect on it, we often realize, “Hey, this isn’t such a big deal after all. I can decide to take on a little more responsibility at work, and it’ll be fine. No one’s going to hate me for that.” But when we leave the decision up to our instincts, even a hint of potential social risk prompts a reflexive “Avoid at all costs\\!” reaction.\n\n---\n\nWe’re overly tempted by immediate payoffs, even when they come at a steep cost later on. We underestimate the cumulative harm of false beliefs, and the cumulative benefit of practicing scout habits. We overestimate how much other people judge us, and how much impact their judgments have on our lives. As a result of all these tendencies, we end up being far too willing to sacrifice our ability to see clearly in exchange for short-term emotional and social rewards. That doesn’t mean scout mindset is always the better choice—but it does mean we have a bias in favor of the soldier, even when the scout is a better choice.\n\n1.  1.  An accurate map is more useful now\n\nWe have far more options now.\n\nWhether your choices make your life better or worse depends on your judgment, and your judgment depends on your mindset.\n\nLiving in the modern world also means we have many more opportunities to fix things we don’t like about our lives. If you’re bad at something, you can take classes, read a For Dummies book, watch a YouTube tutorial, get a tutor, or hire someone to do it for you. If you’re chafing under the constrictive social mores of your town, you can find kindred spirits online or move to a big city. If your family is abusive, you can cut ties with them.\n\nNot all of these solutions are equally effective for everyone, and not all of them are worth the effort or cost. Deciding which solutions are worth trying is a matter of judgment. Deciding which problems in your life are worth trying to solve at all, versus simply learning to live with, is a matter of judgment, too.\n\nThis abundance of opportunity makes scout mindset far more useful than it would have been for our ancestors. After all, what’s the point of admitting your problems exist if you can’t fix them? What’s the point of noticing your disagreements with your community if you can’t leave? Having an accurate map doesn’t help you very much when you’re allowed to travel only one path.\n\nSo if our instincts undervalue truth, that’s not surprising—our instincts evolved in a different world, one better suited to the soldier. Increasingly, our world is becoming one that rewards the ability to see clearly, especially in the long run; a world in which your happiness isn’t nearly as dependent on your ability to accommodate yourself to whatever life, skills, and social groups you happened to be born into.\n\nMore and more, it’s a scout’s world now.\n\n1.  1.  Feeling objective doesn't make you a scout\n\nWe think of ourselves as objective because we feel objective. We scrutinize our own logic and it seems sound. We don’t detect any signs of bias in ourselves. We feel unemotional, dispassionate.\nBut the fact that you feel calm doesn’t mean you’re being fair.\n\nbeing able to explain a position “rationally,” - by which people usually mean that they can make a compelling argument in favor of their position—doesn’t mean the position is fair. Of course your argument seems compelling to you; everyone’s argument seems compelling to them. That’s how motivated reasoning works.\n\nIn fact, viewing yourself as rational can backfire. The more objective you think you are, the more you trust your own intuitions and opinions as accurate representations of reality, and the less inclined you are to question them.\n\nWhen you start from the premise that you’re an objective thinker, you lend your conclusions an air of unimpeachability they usually don’t deserve.\n\n1.  1.  Being smart and knowledgeable doesn't make you a scout\n\nwhen you ask people for their opinions on other ideologically charged scientific issues: Should the government fund stem cell research? How did the universe begin? Did humans evolve from lower animal species? On all these questions, the people with the highest levels of scientific intelligence were also the most politically polarized in their opinions.\n\nTruth doesn't always lie in the center. If anyone claims so, that would be false balance.\n\nOn any particular issue, the truth may lie close to the far left or the far right or anywhere else. The point is simply that as people become better informed, they should start to converge on the truth, wherever it happens to be. Instead, we see the opposite pattern—as people get better informed, they diverge.\n\nThis is a crucially important result, because being smart and being knowledgeable on a particular topic are two more things that give us a false sense of security in our own reasoning. A high IQ and an advanced degree might give you an advantage in ideologically neutral domains like solving math problems or figuring out where to invest your money. But they won’t protect you from bias on ideologically charged questions.\n\nIntelligence and knowledge are just tools. You can use those tools to help you see the world clearly, if that’s what you’re motivated to do. Or you can use them to defend a particular viewpoint, if you’re motivated to do that instead. But there’s nothing inherent to the tools that makes you a scout.\n\n1.  1.  Actually practicing scout mindset makes you a scout\n\nIt’s easy to think, “Of course I change my mind in response to evidence,” or “Of course I apply my principles consistently,” or “Of course I’m fair-minded,” whether or not those things are true. The test of scout mindset isn’t whether you see yourself as the kind of person who does these things. It’s whether you can point to concrete cases in which you did, in fact, do these things.\n\nFeeling reasonable, being smart and knowledgeable, being aware of motivated reasoning—all these things seem like they should be indicators of scout mindset, yet they have surprisingly little to do with it. The only real sign of a scout is whether you act like one.\n\nFive signs of scout mindset, behavioral cues that someone cares about truth and will seek it out even when they’re not forced to, and even when the truth isn’t favorable to them.\n\n\\- \\#\\#\\# 1. Do you tell other people when you realize they were right?\n\nTechnically, scout mindset only requires you to be able to acknowledge to yourself that you were wrong, not to other people. Still, a willingness to say “I was wrong” to someone else is a strong sign of a person who prizes the truth over their own ego. Can you think of cases in which you’ve done the same?\n\n\\- \\#\\#\\# 2. How do you react to personal criticism?\n\nIt’s a lot easier to say you welcome criticism than it is to actually welcome it. But in so many domains, getting honest feedback is essential to improvement.\n\nTo gauge your comfort with criticism, it’s not enough just to ask yourself, “Am I open to criticism?” Instead, examine your track record. Are there examples of criticism you’ve acted upon? Have you rewarded a critic (for example, by promoting him)? Do you go out of your way to make it easier for other people to criticize you?\n\n\\- \\#\\#\\# 3. Do you ever prove yourself wrong?\n\n“We all identified with something because it sounded like our reality,”\n\nCan you think of any examples in which you voluntarily proved yourself wrong? Perhaps you were about to voice an opinion online, but decided to search for counterarguments first, and ended up finding them compelling. Or perhaps at work you were advocating for a new strategy, but changed your mind after you ran the numbers more carefully and realized it wouldn’t be feasible.\n\n\\- \\#\\#\\# 4. Do you take precautions to avoid fooling yourself?\n\nDo you try to avoid biasing the information you get? For example, when you ask your friend to weigh in on a fight you had with your partner, do you describe the disagreement without revealing which side you were on, so as to avoid influencing your friend’s answer? When you launch a new project at work, do you decide ahead of time what will count as a success and what will count as a failure, so you’re not tempted to move the goalposts later?\n\n\\- \\#\\#\\# 5. Do you have any good critics?\n\nIt’s tempting to view your critics as mean-spirited, ill-informed, or unreasonable. And it’s likely that some of them are. But it’s unlikely that all of them are. Can you name people who are critical of your beliefs, profession, or life choices who you consider thoughtful, even if you believe they’re wrong? Or can you at least name reasons why someone might disagree with you that you would consider reasonable (even if you don’t happen to know of specific people who hold those views)?\n\n---\n\nBeing able to name reasonable critics, being willing to say “The other side has a point this time,” being willing to acknowledge when you were wrong—it’s things like these that distinguish people who actually care about truth from people who only think they do.\n\nBut the biggest sign of scout mindset may be this: Can you point to occasions in which you were in soldier mindset? If that sounds backward, remember that motivated reasoning is our natural state. It’s universal, hardwired into our brains. So if you never notice yourself doing it, what’s more likely—that you happen to be wired differently from the rest of humanity or that you’re simply not as self-aware as you could be?\n\nLearning to spot your own biases, in the moment, is no easy feat. But it’s not impossible, if you have the right tools. That’s what the next two chapters are about.\n\n---\n\n1.  1.  Noticing biases\n\nIf you get sued and you win the case, should the person who sued you pay your legal costs? If you’re like most people (85 percent, in one study1), your answer is yes. After all, if you’re falsely accused of something, why should you be out thousands of dollars in lawyers’ fees? That wouldn’t be fair.\n\nHowever, when the question in that study was slightly reworded—“If you sue someone and you lose the case, should you pay his costs?”—only 44 percent of people said yes. Imagining yourself in the role of the person who sued and lost brings to mind alternate arguments. For example, you might have lost simply because the other side is wealthy and can afford better lawyers. It’s not fair to discourage victims from suing just because they can’t afford to lose, right?\n\nBoth the arguments for and against the “loser pays” policy have at least some merit. But which one comes to mind will depend on whether you’re the plaintiff or the defendant—and it will likely never occur to you that you could have thought of an opposing argument if you had been on the other side of the case.\n\n1.  1.  A thought experiment is a peak into the counterfactual world\n\nYou can’t detect motivated reasoning in yourself just by scrutinizing your reasoning and concluding that it makes sense. You have to compare your reasoning to the way you would have reasoned in a counterfactual world, a world in which your motivations were different—would you judge that politician’s actions differently if he was in the opposite party? Would you evaluate that advice differently if your friend had offered it instead of your spouse? Would you consider that study’s methodology sound if its conclusions supported your side?\n\nYou can’t literally visit the counterfactual world. But you can do the next best thing—peek into it virtually, with a thought experiment.\n\nlets explore five different types of thought experiments: the double standard test, the outsider test, the conformity test, the selective skeptic test, and the status quo bias test.\n\nThought experiments only work if you actually do them. So don’t simply formulate a verbal question for yourself. Conjure up the counterfactual world, place yourself in it, and observe your reaction.\n\n---\n\n1.  1.  Common thought experiments\n\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">Name</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">Definition</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">-----------------------—</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------—</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">The Outsider Test</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">How would you evaluate this situation if it wasn’t your situation?</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">The Conformity Test</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">If other people no longer held this view, would you still hold it?</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">The Selective Skeptic Test</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">If this evidence supported the other side, how credible would you judge it to be?</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">The Status Quo Bias Test</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">If your current situation was not the status quo, would you actively choose it?</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">The Double Standard Test</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">Are you judging one person (or group) by a different standard than you would use for another person (or group)?</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n---\n\nWhat thought experiments do is simply reveal that your reasoning changes as your motivations change. That the principles you’re inclined to invoke or the objections that spring to your mind depend on your motives: the motive to defend your image or your in-group’s status; the motive to advocate for a self-serving policy; fear of change or rejection.\n\nCatching your brain in the act of motivated reasoning—noticing when an experiment’s previously invisible flaws jump out at you, or noticing that your preferences change as you switch around supposedly irrelevant details of a scenario—breaks down the illusion that your initial judgment is the objective truth. It convinces you, viscerally, that your reasoning is contingent; that your initial judgments are a starting point for exploration, not an end point.\n\n1.  How Sure Are You?\n    1.  We like feeling certain\n\nOverconfidence, when confidence that one is right outstrips the actual accuracy. Doctors\n\nThe certainty we express is partly just for simplicity’s sake. Conversation would be unwieldy if we had to stop and assign a probability to every statement we made. But even when someone does prompt us to stop and reflect on our level of confidence, we often claim to be completely certain.\n\nEven professionals are frequently certain and wrong in their area of expertise. For example, many studies have found that doctors routinely overestimate their ability to diagnose patients.\n\nIf we tend to be overly certain about our knowledge, that’s even more the case when it comes to our opinions.\n\nNot all overconfidence is due to motivated reasoning. Sometimes we simply don’t realize how complicated a topic is, so we overestimate how easy it is to get the right answer. But a large portion of overconfidence stems from a desire to feel certain. Certainty is simple. Certainty is comfortable. Certainty makes us feel smart and competent.\n\nYour strength as a scout is in your ability to resist that temptation, to push past your initial judgment, and to think in shades of gray instead of black and white. To distinguish the feeling of “95% sure” from “75% sure” from “55% sure.”\n\n1.  1.  Quantifying your uncertainty\n\nA scout treats their degree of certainty as a prediction of their likelihood of being right.\n\nImagine sorting all of your beliefs into buckets based on how sure you are that you’re right about each one. This would include quotidian predictions (“I will enjoy this restaurant”), beliefs about your life (“My partner is faithful to me”), beliefs about how the world works (“Smoking causes cancer”), core premises (“Magic isn’t real”), and so on. Putting a belief into the “70% sure” bucket is like saying, “This is the kind of thing I expect to get right roughly 70 percent of the time.”\n\nWhat you’re implicitly aiming for when you tag your beliefs with various confidence levels is perfect calibration. That means your “50% sure” claims are in fact correct 50 percent of the time, your “60% sure” claims are correct 60 percent of the time, your “70% sure” claims are correct 70 percent of the time, and so on.\n\nPerfect calibration is an abstract ideal, not something that’s possible to achieve in reality. Still, it’s a useful benchmark against which to compare yourself.\n\n1.  1.  A bet can reveal how sure you really are\n\nImagine you’re talking with a friend who’s struggling to get her new catering business off the ground. You reassure her, “You’re amazing at this stuff\\! The only reason business is slow is because you’re just starting out. Everyone has trouble getting clients at first\\!”\n\nShe replies, “Thanks\\! I’m so glad you feel that way. Could you recommend me to your coworkers?”\n\nSuddenly you feel hesitant. You recall her telling you about backing out of a job at the last minute . . . and you realize that you’ve never actually tasted her cooking . . . and you can’t help but ask yourself, “How sure am I, really, that she’ll do a decent job?”\n\nWhen you were reassuring your friend a moment earlier, you weren’t lying. You just weren’t thinking about what you actually believed, because it didn’t seem to matter. But once there are actual stakes, and your reputation could take a hit if you guess wrong about your friend’s catering skill, your brain switches over from the goal “be supportive” to the goal “actually try to get the right answer.”\n\nImagine that a company sells toothpaste. The press secretary might assert confidently, “Our toothpaste whitens teeth better than any other brand on the market.” But suppose the board is approached by a dental school professor who says, “I’d like to do a study. I’ll assign groups of people to use one of the leading brands of toothpaste, without telling them which brand it is, and then I’ll measure how much whiter their teeth are. I’ll publish whatever results I get.”\n\nIf the board was truly confident that their toothpaste worked best, they would say, “Great—a chance to prove to the public that we’re the best\\!” But despite the press secretary’s assurances, the board might decide that they’re not confident enough they would win such a contest, and it’s not worth risking the embarrassment of losing.\n\nThe press secretary isn’t thinking about what’s true. He’s thinking about what he can get away with saying, what will present the company in the best light while still being at least sort of plausible. But the board is incentivized to form their best guess about the truth, because the company will thrive if they guess right and suffer if they’re wrong. The press secretary makes claims; the board makes bets.\n\nThe word bet might conjure up horse races and blackjack tables, but its meaning is far more general. A bet is any decision in which you stand to gain or lose something of value, based on the outcome. That could include money, health, time—or reputation, as in the case of your catering friend who wants your endorsement. So when you’re thinking about how sure you are, your answer will be more honest if you switch from thinking in terms of “What can I get away with claiming to myself?” to “How would I bet, if there was something at stake?”\n\nA tip when you’re imagining betting on your beliefs: You may need to get more concrete about what you believe by coming up with a hypothetical test that could be performed to prove you right or wrong. For example, if you believe “Our computer servers are highly secure,” a hypothetical test might be something like this: Suppose you were to hire a hacker to try to break in to your systems. If they succeed, you lose one month’s salary. How confident do you feel that you would win that bet?\n\n1.  1.  The equivalent bet test\n\nThe examples of bets in the previous section are meant to generate a qualitative sense of your confidence in a belief. Do you feel happy to take the bet, without hesitating? Do you feel a little bit of doubt? Do you feel truly torn? Your hesitation, or lack thereof, is a proxy for your degree of confidence that your belief is true.\n\nContemplating a bet can also be used to pin down how sure you are quantitatively, helping you put a number on your degree of confidence.\n\nI can bet on self-driving cars, and get $10,000 if they’re on the market in a year. Alternately, I can take the “ball bet”: I’m given a box containing four balls, one of which is gray. I reach in and pull out one ball, without looking—if it’s gray, I win $10,000.\n\nWhich gamble would I rather take? I hesitate for a moment, but I feel happier with the ball bet. Since the probability of winning the ball bet is 1 in 4 (or 25 percent), the fact that I feel more confident in the ball bet implies that I’m less than 25 percent confident in self-driving cars making it to the market in a year.\n\nLet’s try decreasing the odds of winning the ball bet. Suppose the box contains sixteen balls, only one of which is gray. Now which do I prefer: betting on drawing the gray ball or betting on self-driving cars in a year?\n\nThis time, I notice that I prefer my chances on self-driving cars. After all, sometimes technological progress surprises us. Maybe one of the companies working on self-driving technology is actually farther along than they’ve been letting on. It seems unlikely, but I’d still rather gamble on that than on being lucky enough to draw the gray ball. And since the probability of drawing a gray ball is 1 in 16 (or about 6 percent), the fact that I would prefer to bet on self-driving cars implies that I am more than 6 percent confident that self-driving cars will make it to the market in a year.\n\nOkay, let’s adjust the chances of winning the ball bet back upward a little bit, to one in nine. Now which do I prefer?\n\nHmm. I’m really torn. Neither seems like a clearly better bet. The bets feel equivalent to me—and since we know that the probability of winning the ball bet is 1 in 9 (or about 11 percent), that implies that I have roughly 11 percent confidence in self-driving cars coming out within a year. I still don’t think the “Self-driving cars will be on the market in a year” forecast is likely to come true, but I’ve gone from a glib “That’s crazy” to a more honest best guess.\n\nbeing able to tell the difference between the feeling of making a claim and the feeling of actually trying to guess what’s true. Making a claim feels like your press secretary is speaking. It feels pat; neat and tidy. Sometimes hurried, as if you’re trying to put something past yourself. The mental motion is declaring, proclaiming, insisting, or perhaps scoffing.\n\n---\n\n1.  How Sure Are You?\n\nIn a scene in the 2016 movie Star Trek Beyond, a spaceship careens across the sky.1 It’s being piloted by Captain Kirk, who is hot on the tail of three enemy ships headed straight for the center of a city, where they intend to detonate a superweapon. Kirk’s right-hand man, Commander Spock, yells to him: “Captain, intercepting all three ships is an impossibility\\!”\n\nAn impossibility. The words sound so authoritative, so definitive. And yet less than sixty seconds later, Kirk has figured out how to maneuver in front of the enemy ships, stopping them with his own ship’s hull before they can reach their destination.\n\nIf you’ve watched much Star Trek before, this won’t surprise you. Spock doesn’t have a great track record when it comes to making accurate predictions. “There’s only a very slight chance this will work,” Spock warns Kirk in one episode of the original TV show, right before their plan works.2 The odds of survival are “less than seven thousand to one,” Spock tells Kirk in another episode, shortly before they escape unharmed.3 The chance of finding survivors is “absolutely none,” Spock declares in yet another episode, right before they discover a large colony of survivors.4\n\n1.  1.  We like feeling certain\n\nSpock is overconfident, meaning that his confidence that he’s right outstrips his actual accuracy. In that respect, Spock isn’t all that different from most of us (except that he makes a much bigger deal about how his predictions are objective and “logical,” which is why I’ve chosen to make an example of him). We very often speak as if there’s no chance we could be mistaken—“There’s no way he can make that shot from that distance\\!” or “I’ll definitely have that done by Friday”—and yet we turn out to be wrong nonetheless.\n\nTo be fair, the certainty we express is partly just for simplicity’s sake. Conversation would be unwieldy if we had to stop and assign a probability to every statement we made. But even when someone does prompt us to stop and reflect on our level of confidence, we often claim to be completely certain. You’ll notice this if you search online for phrases like, “How certain are you that” or “How confident are you that.” Here are a few examples I pulled from discussions on Quora, Yahoo\\! Answers, Reddit, and other forums:\n\nAs a percentage, how certain are you that intelligent life exists outside of Earth? “I am 100% certain there’s other intelligent life.”5\n\nHow confident are you that you are going to hit your 2017 sales goals? “I’m 100% confident.”6\n\nAtheists, how confident are you that you won’t convert to a religion like Christianity on your deathbed? “100% confident.”7\n\nEven professionals are frequently certain and wrong in their area of expertise. For example, many studies have found that doctors routinely overestimate their ability to diagnose patients. One study examined the autopsy results for patients who had been given diagnoses with “complete certainty,” and found that in 40 percent of those cases, the diagnosis was incorrect.8\n\nIf we tend to be overly certain about our knowledge, that’s even more the case when it comes to our opinions. We say things like, “There is no question that America needs a living wage,” or “It’s obvious that the internet has wrecked our attention spans,” or “Of course that bill would be a disaster.”\n\nNot all overconfidence is due to motivated reasoning. Sometimes we simply don’t realize how complicated a topic is, so we overestimate how easy it is to get the right answer. But a large portion of overconfidence stems from a desire to feel certain. Certainty is simple. Certainty is comfortable. Certainty makes us feel smart and competent.\n\nYour strength as a scout is in your ability to resist that temptation, to push past your initial judgment, and to think in shades of gray instead of black and white. To distinguish the feeling of “95% sure” from “75% sure” from “55% sure.” That’s what we’ll learn to do in this chapter.\n\nBut first, let’s back up—what does it even mean to put a number on your degree of belief?\n\n1.  1.  Quantifying your uncertainty\n\nTypically, when people think about how sure they are, they ask themselves something like: “Do I actively feel any doubt?” If the answer is no, as it often is, they declare themselves to be “100% certain.”\n\nThat’s an understandable way to think about certainty, but it’s not the way a scout thinks about it. A scout treats their degree of certainty as a prediction of their likelihood of being right. Imagine sorting all of your beliefs into buckets based on how sure you are that you’re right about each one. This would include quotidian predictions (“I will enjoy this restaurant”), beliefs about your life (“My partner is faithful to me”), beliefs about how the world works (“Smoking causes cancer”), core premises (“Magic isn’t real”), and so on. Putting a belief into the “70% sure” bucket is like saying, “This is the kind of thing I expect to get right roughly 70 percent of the time.”\n\nWhat you’re implicitly aiming for when you tag your beliefs with various confidence levels is perfect calibration. That means your “50% sure” claims are in fact correct 50 percent of the time, your “60% sure” claims are correct 60 percent of the time, your “70% sure” claims are correct 70 percent of the time, and so on.\n\n1.  1.  Perfect calibration\n\nPerfect calibration is an abstract ideal, not something that’s possible to achieve in reality. Still, it’s a useful benchmark against which to compare yourself. To get a hang of the concept, let’s continue picking on Spock and see how his calibration measures up against perfection.\n\n1.  1.  A bet can reveal how sure you really are\n\nImagine you’re talking with a friend who’s struggling to get her new catering business off the ground. You reassure her, “You’re amazing at this stuff\\! The only reason business is slow is because you’re just starting out. Everyone has trouble getting clients at first\\!”\n\nShe replies, “Thanks\\! I’m so glad you feel that way. Could you recommend me to your coworkers?”\n\nSuddenly you feel hesitant. You recall her telling you about backing out of a job at the last minute . . . and you realize that you’ve never actually tasted her cooking . . . and you can’t help but ask yourself, “How sure am I, really, that she’ll do a decent job?”\n\nWhen you were reassuring your friend a moment earlier, you weren’t lying. You just weren’t thinking about what you actually believed, because it didn’t seem to matter. But once there are actual stakes, and your reputation could take a hit if you guess wrong about your friend’s catering skill, your brain switches over from the goal “be supportive” to the goal “actually try to get the right answer.”\n\nEvolutionary psychologist Robert Kurzban has an analogy for these two modes.11 In a company, there’s a board of directors whose role is to make the crucial decisions for the company—how to spend its budget, which risks to take, when to change strategies, and so on. Then there’s a press secretary whose role is to give statements about the company’s values, its mission, and the reasoning behind its decisions.\n\nIf a competitor starts gaining market share, the company’s press secretary might assure the public, “We’re not worried. Our brand has been America’s favorite for thirty years, and that’s not going to change.” However, if you were to sit in on a board meeting, you might find that behind the scenes, the board is taking the risk seriously and looking for ways to cut costs.\n\nImagine that the company sells toothpaste. The press secretary might assert confidently, “Our toothpaste whitens teeth better than any other brand on the market.” But suppose the board is approached by a dental school professor who says, “I’d like to do a study. I’ll assign groups of people to use one of the leading brands of toothpaste, without telling them which brand it is, and then I’ll measure how much whiter their teeth are. I’ll publish whatever results I get.”\n\nIf the board was truly confident that their toothpaste worked best, they would say, “Great—a chance to prove to the public that we’re the best\\!” But despite the press secretary’s assurances, the board might decide that they’re not confident enough they would win such a contest, and it’s not worth risking the embarrassment of losing.\n\nThe press secretary isn’t thinking about what’s true. He’s thinking about what he can get away with saying, what will present the company in the best light while still being at least sort of plausible. But the board is incentivized to form their best guess about the truth, because the company will thrive if they guess right and suffer if they’re wrong. The press secretary makes claims; the board makes bets.\n\nThe word bet might conjure up horse races and blackjack tables, but its meaning is far more general. A bet is any decision in which you stand to gain or lose something of value, based on the outcome. That could include money, health, time—or reputation, as in the case of your catering friend who wants your endorsement. So when you’re thinking about how sure you are, your answer will be more honest if you switch from thinking in terms of “What can I get away with claiming to myself?” to “How would I bet, if there was something at stake?”\n\nSometimes a project I’m working on seems hopeless. For example—just to pull a random, hypothetical situation out of thin air: “The book I’m writing is terrible and I should give up.” But how sure am I that I’m not just in a temporary funk? I’m 100% sure, my press secretary insists—but let’s ignore him, and pose a question to the board instead: “Suppose you would win $1,000 for correctly guessing whether you will still feel this way about your book a week from now. How would you bet?”\n\nNow that there’s money on the line, I hesitate. I recall that I have felt pessimistic about my book, or some other project, many times in the past, and the dark cloud usually goes away in a day or two. It feels like a better bet to pick “Yes, I probably will feel better.” Going through that exercise doesn’t magically get rid of my bad mood, but it does take the edge off it. It’s useful to have proven to myself that I wouldn’t be willing to bet on this mood lasting, even though it feels like it will last forever.\n\nA tip when you’re imagining betting on your beliefs: You may need to get more concrete about what you believe by coming up with a hypothetical test that could be performed to prove you right or wrong. For example, if you believe “Our computer servers are highly secure,” a hypothetical test might be something like this: Suppose you were to hire a hacker to try to break in to your systems. If they succeed, you lose one month’s salary. How confident do you feel that you would win that bet?\n\nIf you believe “I was being reasonable in that fight with my partner, and he was being unreasonable,” a hypothetical test might go something like this: Suppose another person, an objective third party, is given all of the relevant details about the fight, and is asked to judge which of you two is being more reasonable. If he judges in your favor, you win $1,000; if not, you lose $1,000. How confident do you feel that you would win that bet?\n\nTHE EQUIVALENT BET TEST\nThe examples of bets in the previous section are meant to generate a qualitative sense of your confidence in a belief. Do you feel happy to take the bet, without hesitating? Do you feel a little bit of doubt? Do you feel truly torn? Your hesitation, or lack thereof, is a proxy for your degree of confidence that your belief is true.\n\nContemplating a bet can also be used to pin down how sure you are quantitatively, helping you put a number on your degree of confidence. Sometimes I hear an ambitious technological forecast like, “Self-driving cars will be on the market within the year\\!” My first reaction is often to scoff, “Well, that’s crazy.” But how sure am I that the forecast is wrong?\n\nTo answer that question, I imagine facing a choice between two possible bets. I use a technique I adapted from decision-making expert Douglas Hubbard called an “equivalent bet test.”12 Here’s how it works in this case: I can bet on self-driving cars, and get $10,000 if they’re on the market in a year. Alternately, I can take the “ball bet”: I’m given a box containing four balls, one of which is gray. I reach in and pull out one ball, without looking—if it’s gray, I win $10,000.\\\\\\*\n\nBall bet (1 in 4 chance of winning):\n\nBet on self-driving cars\n\nDraw from a box with four balls, one of which is gray. If I draw the gray ball, I get $10,000.\n\nIf fully self-driving cars are available for purchase in a year, I get $10,000.\n\nWhich gamble would I rather take? I hesitate for a moment, but I feel happier with the ball bet. Since the probability of winning the ball bet is 1 in 4 (or 25 percent), the fact that I feel more confident in the ball bet implies that I’m less than 25 percent confident in self-driving cars making it to the market in a year.\n\nLet’s try decreasing the odds of winning the ball bet. Suppose the box contains sixteen balls, only one of which is gray. Now which do I prefer: betting on drawing the gray ball or betting on self-driving cars in a year?\n\nBall bet (1 in 16 chance of winning):\n\nBet on self-driving cars\n\nDraw from a box with sixteen balls, one of which is gray. If I draw the gray ball, I get $10,000.\n\nIf fully self-driving cars are available for purchase in a year, I get $10,000.\n\nThis time, I notice that I prefer my chances on self-driving cars. After all, sometimes technological progress surprises us. Maybe one of the companies working on self-driving technology is actually farther along than they’ve been letting on. It seems unlikely, but I’d still rather gamble on that than on being lucky enough to draw the gray ball. And since the probability of drawing a gray ball is 1 in 16 (or about 6 percent), the fact that I would prefer to bet on self-driving cars implies that I am more than 6 percent confident that self-driving cars will make it to the market in a year.\n\nOkay, let’s adjust the chances of winning the ball bet back upward a little bit, to one in nine. Now which do I prefer?\n\nBall bet (1 in 9 chance of winning):\n\nBet on self-driving cars\n\nDraw from a box with nine balls, one of which is gray. If I draw the gray ball, I get $10,000.\n\nIf fully self-driving cars are available for purchase in a year, I get $10,000.\n\nHmm. I’m really torn. Neither seems like a clearly better bet. The bets feel equivalent to me—and since we know that the probability of winning the ball bet is 1 in 9 (or about 11 percent), that implies that I have roughly 11 percent confidence in self-driving cars coming out within a year. I still don’t think the “Self-driving cars will be on the market in a year” forecast is likely to come true, but I’ve gone from a glib “That’s crazy” to a more honest best guess.\n\n•   •   •\nThe core skill of the previous chapter on thought experiments was a kind of self-awareness, a sense that your judgments are contingent—that what seems true or reasonable or fair or desirable can change when you mentally vary some feature of the question that should have been irrelevant. The specific thought experiments we covered are all useful tools that I and other people use regularly. But the underlying shift in how you view your mind’s output is even more useful.\n\nThere’s a core skill in this chapter, too: being able to tell the difference between the feeling of making a claim and the feeling of actually trying to guess what’s true. Making a claim feels like your press secretary is speaking. It feels pat; neat and tidy. Sometimes hurried, as if you’re trying to put something past yourself. The mental motion is declaring, proclaiming, insisting, or perhaps scoffing.\n\nTrying to guess what’s true feels like being the board of directors, deciding how to bet. There’s at least a second or two when you don’t know what answer you’re going to end up giving. It’s like you’re squinting at the evidence, trying to summarize what you see. The mental motions involved are estimating, predicting, weighing, and deliberating.\n\nQuantifying your uncertainty, getting calibrated, and coming up with hypothetical bets are all valuable skills in their own right. But having the self-awareness to be able to tell whether you’re describing reality honestly, to the best of your abilities, is even more valuable still.\n\n1.  Coping with reality\n    1.  Keeping despair at bay\n\nOne of the most fundamental human needs is to feel like things are basically okay; That’s why most people in an emergency resort to various forms of motivated reasoning, like denial, wishful thinking, and rationalizing.\n\nThe cruel irony is that an emergency is when you most need to be clear-eyed. The more you rely on motivated reasoning, the more you degrade your ability to make judgment calls.\n\nCommitment to finding ways of keeping despair at bay without distorting his map of reality. (“You are doing the best you can. You can only do the best you can.”)\n\n1.  1.  Honest VS. Self-deceptive ways of coping.\n\n“Was it a mistake to quit my job?” “Did I offend him?” Someone criticizes us. We face an unpleasant choice. We fail at something. In reaction, we reach for a thought that keeps negative emotions at bay—a coping strategy.\n\nIn the book Mistakes Were Made (But Not by Me), psychologists Carol Tavris and Elliot Aronson explore self-justification, a type of motivated reasoning in which you convince yourself after the fact that you made the right choice. The book is mostly about the many downsides of self-justification—how it commits us to stick with bad decisions rather than changing course, and dooms us to repeat our mistakes instead of learning from them. Still, Tavris and Aronson conclude, we need at least some amount of self-justification for the sake of our mental health: “Without it, we would prolong the awful pangs of embarrassment. We would torture ourselves with regret over the road not taken or over how badly we navigated the road we did take.”\n\n`But is it really true that we need self-justification to prevent us from “torturing ourselves with regret”? Couldn’t we just . . . learn to not torture ourselves with regret instead?`\n\nIn Thinking, Fast and Slow, Nobel Prize–winning psychologist Daniel Kahneman points out an emotional benefit of motivated reasoning: resilience. It’s easier to bounce back from a failure if you can blame it on anyone but yourself. He uses the example of a door-to-door salesperson, a job that involves long strings of rejection: “When one has just had a door slammed in one’s face by an angry homemaker, the thought that ‘she was an awful woman’ is clearly superior to ‘I am an inept salesperson.’”\n\nBut are those really our only two options? We could instead tell ourselves, “Yes, I screwed up that sale. But everyone makes mistakes.” Or “Yes, I screwed up that sale. Still, I’m improving—I used to get doors slammed in my face every day, and now it only happens every week\\!”\n\nSurely we can find a way to bounce back from our setbacks that doesn’t require us to blame them on other people—an honest coping strategy.\n\n> Whenever I have found out that I have blundered, or that my work has been imperfect, and when I have been contemptuously criticized, and even when I have been overpraised, so that I have felt mortified, it has been my greatest comfort to say hundreds of times to myself that “I have worked as hard and as well as I could, and no man can do more than this.”\n\nScouts aren’t invulnerable to fear, anxiety, insecurity, despair, or any of the other emotions that give rise to motivated reasoning, and they rely on coping strategies just like anyone else. They just take more care to select coping strategies that don’t mess with the accuracy of their judgment.\n\nWhen a negative emotion strikes, it’s as if we hurriedly reach into the bucket to grab something, anything, to make ourselves feel better. We don’t pay much attention to the kind of coping strategy we pull out, and whether it involves self-deception or not. As long as it makes us feel better, and it’s halfway plausible, it’ll do.\n\nthere is an abundance of different coping strategies, and you don’t need to be so quick to go with the first thing you happen to pull out of the bucket. You can almost always find something comforting that doesn’t require self-deception if you rummage around in there just a bit longer.\n\n## Bucket of coping strategies\n\n![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31969517/120054182-1195a780-c04c-11eb-8093-b887d039c5c6.png)\n\n1.  1.  Make a plan\n\nTere are self-deceptive ways of coping with the thought of something unpleasant, such as coming up with rationalizations for why a task isn’t actually necessary, or flat-out denial. But there are also honest coping strategies, like coming up with a hypothetical plan.\n\nIt’s striking how much the urge to conclude “That’s not true” diminishes once you feel like you have a concrete plan for what you would do if the thing were true. It doesn’t have to be elaborate. Even a simple plan, like “Here’s how I would explain the failure to my team . . .” or “Here’s how I would begin my search for a new job . . .” goes a long way toward making you feel like you don’t need to rely on denial to cope with reality.\n\n1.  1.  Notice silver linings\n\nConceding an argument earns me credit. It makes me more credible in other cases, because I’ve demonstrated that I don’t stick to my guns just for the sake of it. It’s like I’m investing in my future ability to be convincing.\n\nA silver lining to any mistake is the lesson you’re going to extract from the experience, which you can use to help save you from similar mistakes in the future.\n\nRemember, the goal isn’t to convince yourself that your misfortune is actually a good thing. You’re not looking for a “sweet lemons” rationalization here. You’re recognizing a silver lining to the cloud, not trying to convince yourself the whole cloud is silver. But in many cases, that’s all you need—noticing the silver lining is enough to make you willing to accept the reality of the cloud.\n\n1.  1.  Focus on a different goal\n\nA friend of mine named Jon cofounded a software company, and in the early days, spent a lot of time recruiting and interviewing potential new hires. He soon noticed something disturbing: When he came across a talented engineer who was interested in the position, he should have felt delighted. High-quality engineers can make all the difference to the success of a new software company. But instead, Jon felt something closer to disappointment or bitterness. He would scrutinize the engineer’s work, hoping to find an excuse to reject it.\n\nReflecting on his behavior, Jon realized: I’ve always prided myself on being the best programmer in the room. That’s why he was motivated to denigrate his “competition,” as a coping strategy to protect his self-esteem.\n\nJon knew that his goal of needing to be the best programmer in the room was unrealistic, not to mention very counterproductive for his fledgling company. So he decided to redirect his focus and revise his goal: Rather than priding himself on being a great programmer, he decided to start priding himself on being an astute judge of programming talent. That was a satisfying enough substitute for the original goal, and actually helpful for hiring instead of counterproductive.\n\n1.  1.  Things could be worse\n\nIn his history of the AIDS crisis, How to Survive a Plague, David France profiles a small group of activists called the Treatment Action Group. They had been following the drug-testing process closely and knew that the odds of finding a miracle drug right away were slim. When the bad news about AZT broke in the summer of 1993, they were disappointed—but not crushed.\n\nMost of the activists in the Treatment Action Group were HIV-positive themselves. How had they kept up their spirits despite their realism about the chance of a cure? In part, by focusing on their gratitude for the things that could have been worse. France describes a meeting during that dispiriting summer at which one of the activists, a man named Peter Staley, said:\n\n> Maybe that is our future, that we’re gonna watch each other die. And that’s going to be awful, if that’s the case. It’s already been awful, so there’s not too much we can do about that . . . I’m just—you know, I really honestly feel glad that I’ve got people to be with. Not many people have that\n\n1.  1.  Does research show that self-deceived people are happier?\n\nOf course, the fact that the “self-deception causes happiness” research is fatally flawed doesn’t prove that self-deception can’t cause happiness. It clearly can, in many cases. It just comes with the downside of eroding your judgment. And given that there are so many ways to cope that don’t involve self-deception, why settle?\n\n---\n\nWith practice, you develop your own tool kit of coping strategies that work for you. Just remember: don’t settle\\! Your ability to see clearly is precious, and you should be reluctant to sacrifice it in exchange for emotional comfort. The good news is that you don’t have to.\n\n---\n\n1.  Motivation Without Self-Deception\n\nThe self-belief model of success: If you convince yourself that you will succeed, you’ll be motivated to attempt hard things and persist in the face of setbacks, such that eventually your optimism will be self-fulfilling. Conversely, if you acknowledge the long odds facing you, or contemplate the possibility of failure, you’ll be too discouraged to try, and your pessimism will be a self-fulfilling prophecy as well.\n\n> Have faith that you can successfully make it, and your feet are nerved to its accomplishment. But mistrust yourself, and think of all the sweet things you have heard the scientists say of maybes, and you will hesitate so long that, at last, all unstrung and trembling, and launching yourself in a moment of despair, you roll in the abyss. - William James\n\nMany situations in our lives are like this, he argued. Choosing to have faith in your success, irrespective of the risk or difficulty, is the only way to summon the will to succeed. Is James right? If you could press a button and become irrationally optimistic about your chances of success—should you?\n\n1.  1.  An accurate picture of your odds helps you choose between goals\n\nTo weigh all the factors successfully, you need an accurate picture of what the odds actually are.\n\nThis is the biggest problem with the self-belief approach to motivation. Because you’re not supposed to think realistically about risk, it becomes impossible to ask yourself questions like, “Is this goal desirable enough to be worth the risk?” and “Are there any other goals that would be similarly desirable but require less risk?” It implicitly assumes that you don’t need to make any decisions; that you’ve already found the one right path, and there are no other options out there worth weighing.\n\nNotice that in William James’s story of the perilous leap on the mountain—his argument for the value of irrational self-belief—he has constructed the example such that there’s zero decision-making involved. You aren’t given the opportunity to compare multiple options or brainstorm ideas you might have missed. The only thing you can do is try to execute the jump successfully.\n\nIn such a situation, where there is only one path available to you, maybe having a realistic picture of your odds of success on that path isn’t very useful. But how often does such a situation actually occur? Even in a real-life mountain-climbing scenario, there’s never literally only one choice. Instead of attempting to leap to a nearby peak, you could try climbing down the side of the mountain. Alternately, you could stay put and hope for rescue. Whether either of those options is a better bet than jumping depends on your estimate of their relative chances of success.\n\nAnd even though the rhetoric around “following your dream” makes it sound like everyone has one and only one dream, most people have more than one thing they enjoy and are good at, or could at least become good at. You’re doing yourself a disservice if you throw yourself into the pursuit of a goal without asking: “Is this goal worth pursuing, compared to other things I could do instead?”\n\n---\n\nAt this point, you might be thinking: “Sure, an accurate picture of the odds is important when you’re choosing a path. But once you’ve already made your choice, then you should switch into irrational optimism for the execution phase.”\n\nOf course, it’s not quite as simple as “switching into irrational optimism.” You can’t just do a thoughtful, realistic calculus of risk and then erase it from your memory. But suppose you could—should you?\n\n1.  1.  An accurate picture of the odds helps you adapt your plan over time\n\nThe reality is that there’s no clear divide between the “decision-making” and “execution” stages of pursuing a goal. Over time, your situation will change, or you’ll learn new information, and you’ll need to revise your estimate of the odds.\n\n1.  1.  An accurate picture of the odds helps you decide how much to stake on success\n\nVenture capitalist Ben Horowitz argues, in The Hard Thing About Hard Things, that there’s no point in thinking about your odds of success when building a company. “When you are building a company, you must believe there is an answer and you cannot pay attention to your odds of finding it. You just have to find it,” he writes. “It matters not whether your chances are nine in ten or one in a thousand; your task is the same.”\n\nBut even if your task is the same, that still leaves the question of how much you should be willing to gamble on your ability to succeed at that task. If your company has a 9 in 10 chance at success, then it might well be worth it to stake your life savings on it. If your chances are closer to 1 in 1,000, you probably want to leave that nest egg untouched.\n\nHaving an accurate picture of the odds doesn’t ever stop being valuable. Still, that leaves us with a psychological challenge: If you have an accurate picture of the odds, how do you keep from getting discouraged? How do you motivate yourself to give it your all, while knowing there’s a significant chance your “all” won’t be enough in the end?\n\n1.  1.  Bets worth taking\n\nWhen Musk’s friends told him that he would probably fail (SpaceX), he replied: “Well, I agree. I think we probably will fail.” In fact, he estimated that there was only about a 10 percent chance that a SpaceX craft would ever make it into orbit.\n\nTwo years later, Musk decided to invest most of the remainder of his PayPal profits into an electric car company, Tesla. That, too, he gave a roughly 10 percent chance of success.\n\nThe low odds Musk assigned to his own projects’ success left many people scratching their heads. In an appearance on 60 Minutes in 2014, interviewer Scott Pelley tried to understand Musk’s logic:\n\nElon Musk: Well, I didn’t really think Tesla would be successful. I thought we would most likely fail . . .\n\nScott Pelley: But you say you didn’t expect the company to be successful? Then why try?\n\nElon Musk: If something’s important enough you should try. Even if the probable outcome is failure.\n\nMusk’s low expectation of success confounds people because they assume the only reason to do something is if it’s likely to succeed. But scouts aren’t motivated by the thought, “This is going to succeed.” They’re motivated by the thought, “This is a bet worth taking.”\n\n---\n\nMost people are already on board with the idea of a “bet worth taking,” in at least some contexts. To give a simple example, suppose someone offered you a bet in which you roll a normal six-sided die. If it lands on a six, you win $200; if not, you lose $10. Should you take it?\n\nAlmost certainly. This is a good bet for you—and you can see exactly how good it is by calculating its expected value. That’s the average amount a bet pays out each time, if you were to take it an infinite number of times.\n\nTo calculate a bet’s expected value, multiply the probability of each outcome by its value and then add up those results. For this bet, the expected value would be:\n\n`([¹⁄₆ probability of winning] × $200) + ([⁵⁄₆ probability of losing] × −$10) = $33.33 − $8.33 = $25 `\nIn other words, if you took this bet many times, the average amount you would win each time is about $25. Not bad money for simply rolling a die\\! This is a great bet to take, even though the most likely outcome is failure.\n\nEvaluating the probabilities involved in a real-life bet, like starting a company, is a much messier, more subjective endeavor. The possible outcomes aren’t well defined the way they are in the case of the die roll. Their corresponding probabilities are subjective. And their “value” involves many factors besides money: How much enjoyment would you get out of running a company? Would it leave you with useful connections and skills, even if it failed? How much of your time would it take up? How much social cachet (or stigma) would it involve?\n\n- - MUSK’S THINKING ABOUT THE TESLA AND SPACEX BETS\\*\\*\n\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">**Probability**</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">**Value**</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">------------------—</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------—</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">10% chance of success</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">The company makes a big dent in one of the most pressing problems facing humanity (sustainability, space travel).</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">90% chance of failure</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">Musk loses his investment, but isn’t personally ruined. The company probably makes a bit of progress on the problem.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\nOverall, both Tesla and SpaceX seemed like good bets to him—even though the most likely outcome for each was failure.\n\nAnother way to think about whether a bet is positive expected value is to imagine taking it many times. Would the value of the expected successes outweigh the value of the expected failures? Over the course of a lifetime, someone like Elon Musk probably has the time and money to attempt at least ten companies like Tesla and SpaceX. If his best guess is that nine of those ten companies will be failures, then the key question is: Would it be worth failing nine times in exchange for one big success?\n\nIn reality, you almost never get to repeat the exact same bet many times. But you’ll have the opportunity to make many different bets over the course of your life. You’ll face bets at your company and in your career more broadly; bets on investment opportunities; chances to bet on trusting another person, or making a difficult ask, or pushing your comfort zone. And the more positive expected value bets you make, the more confident you can be that you’ll end up ahead overall, even if each individual bet is far from a sure thing.\n\n1.  1.  Accepting variance gives you equanimity\n\nAlmost everyone, when asked to explain their success, gives a causal explanation like, “My extra practice is finally starting to pay off” or “It’s because I believed in myself.” How often do you hear someone chalk their own success up to “random variation”?\n\n## The psychological effect of expecting variance\n\n![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31969517/120054198-2c681c00-c04c-11eb-9dce-15a9e936cda3.png)\n\nThe emotional toll of variance is actually worse than this graph suggests. We’re loss averse, meaning that the pain of a loss is greater than the pleasure of a similarly sized gain. Therefore, if you don’t build variance into your expectations, the low points on the spiky line graph will feel even lower than they are.\n\nIt might be motivating to believe with absolute certainty that you’re going to win, but it’s not realistic—there’s always some element of chance involved, in any endeavor. Over time, your outcomes will fluctuate; some of your bets will turn out well, and many will turn out poorly.\n\nBut as long as you continue making positive expected value bets, that variance will mostly wash out in the long run. Building that variance into your expectations has the nice side effect of giving you equanimity. Instead of being elated when your bets pay off, and crushed when they don’t, your emotions will be tied to the trend line underneath the variance.\n\n> The goal isn’t to attribute everything to luck. It’s to do your best to mentally separate out the role that luck plays in your results from the role that your decision-making plays, and to judge yourself based on the latter.\n\nHere’s an example of Bauer doing a postmortem of his pitching in one game:\n\nNot a great pitch, but I defend the logic behind throwing it. Walked \\[Jason\\] Castro, not a good idea. Then, tried to get \\[Brian\\] Dozier on a fastball away, came back, good pitch, but he hit it.\n\nNotice how he gives himself credit, then blame, then credit—all based on the quality of his pitching choices, independently of how they turned out.\n\n1.  1.  Coming to terms with risk\n\nBezos imagined being eighty years old and looking back at his life choices. Missing out on his 1994 Wall Street bonus wasn’t the kind of thing he would care about decades later. But passing up the chance to participate in the growth of the internet absolutely was. “If it failed, fine,” he decided. “I would be very proud of the fact when I’m 80 that I tried.” That’s what clinched his decision to take the plunge, quit his job, and start the company that would become Amazon.\n\nThe “self-belief” model of motivation assumes that if you acknowledge the possibility of failure, then you’ll be too demoralized or afraid to take risks. In that model, people who believe that failure is unthinkable are the ones who try the hardest to succeed. Yet in practice, things often seem to work the other way around—accepting the possibility of failure in advance is liberating. It makes you bold, not timid. It’s what gives you the courage to take the risks required to achieve something big.\n\nWhen one interviewer praised Elon Musk for being fearless in starting companies that other people think are crazy, Musk admitted that he actually feels fear very strongly. He’s just learned to manage that fear by coming to terms with the probability of failure. “Something that can be helpful is fatalism, to some degree,” he explained. “If you just accept the probabilities, then that diminishes fear. So in starting SpaceX, I thought the odds of success were less than 10 percent, and I just accepted that probably I would lose everything.”\n\nIn moments when you're deciding what risks to take or stepping back to reflect on their life choices, being able to feel satisfied with the bet they’re taking—even if it fails—makes all the difference.\n\nWhen I’m taking a bet I believe is worthwhile but risky I think about a line from a blog post I read that stayed with me: “You want to get into a mental state where if the bad outcome comes to pass, you will only nod your head and say ‘I knew this card was in the deck, and I knew the odds, and I would make the same bets again, given the same opportunities.’”\n\n---\n\nWe have a choice of coping strategies for dealing with emotions like anxiety, disappointment, regret, and fear. Some coping strategies involve self-deception, and some don’t—so why settle for the former?\n\nThe same logic applies to our strategies for motivating ourselves to be ambitious, take risks, and persevere when things get tough. The soldier approach to motivation requires you to believe things that aren’t true—that your odds of success don’t matter as long as you believe in yourself, that failure is not an option, that “luck” is irrelevant.\n\nSoldier morale can be effective, at least in the short term. But it’s a brittle kind of morale, one that requires you to avoid or rationalize away new information that could threaten your ability to keep believing in success.\n\nScouts rely on a different kind of morale. Instead of being motivated by the promise of guaranteed success, a scout is motivated by the knowledge that they’re making a smart bet, which they can feel good about having made whether or not it succeeds. Even if a particular bet has a low probability of success, they know that their overall probability of success in the long run is much higher, as long as they keep making good bets. They’re motivated by the knowledge that downturns are inevitable, but will wash out in the long run; that although failure is possible, it’s also tolerable.\n\nThe scout approach to morale doesn’t ask you to sacrifice your ability to make clear-eyed decisions. And it’s a robust kind of morale, one that doesn’t require protection from reality, because it’s rooted in truth.\n\n1.  Influence without overconfidence\n\nThe common wisdom is that the more confidence you can muster in your beliefs, the more influential you will be. Confidence is magnetic. It invites people to listen to you, follow you, and trust that you know what you’re doing. If you look up advice on how to be influential or persuasive, you’ll find lots of exhortations to \\*\\*believe in yourself\\*\\*\n\nThis would seem to bode poorly for scouts; if you’re being intellectually honest, you’re not going to have certainty about everything. Fortunately, the common wisdom isn’t quite right.\n\n1.  1.  Two types of confidence\n\nOne is epistemic confidence, or certainty—how sure you are about what’s true. If you say, “I’m 99 percent sure he is lying,” or “I guarantee this will work,” or “There’s no way the Republicans can win,” you’re displaying a lot of epistemic confidence.\n\nSeparately, there’s social confidence, or self-assurance: Are you at ease in social situations? Do you act like you deserve to be there, like you’re secure in yourself and your role in the group? Do you speak as if you’re worth listening to?\n\n## Two types of confidence\n\n![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31969517/120054214-3853de00-c04c-11eb-931c-636ba27e8b02.png)\n\nWe tend to conflate epistemic confidence and social confidence, treating them as if they’re a package deal. It’s easy to picture someone with both types of confidence, such as a leader pumping up his team with an inspiring pep talk about how there’s no doubt in his mind that they’re going to succeed. It’s also easy to picture someone lacking in both types of confidence, stammering nervously, “Uh, I’m really not sure what we should do here . . .”\n\nBut epistemic confidence and social confidence don’t have to be a package deal. Just look at Benjamin Franklin. He was brimming with social confidence—famously charming, witty, and ebullient, he made friends and launched new institutions his entire life. He was basically a celebrity in France, where he was constantly surrounded by adoring women who called him “Cher Papa” (“Dear Papa”).\n\nYet Franklin paired his abundance of social confidence with an intentional lack of epistemic confidence. It was a practice he had started when he was young, after noticing that people were more likely to reject his arguments when he used firm language like certainly and undoubtedly. So Franklin trained himself to avoid those expressions, prefacing his statements instead with caveats like “I think . . .” or “If I’m not mistaken . . .” or “It appears to me at present . . .”\n\nIt was a tough habit to stick to at first. One of Franklin’s favorite pastimes as a young man had been proving other people wrong, or what might nowadays be called “destroying” people in arguments. But the habit soon got easier as he started noticing how much more receptive people were to his opinions when he expressed them gently.\n\n1.  1.  People judge you on social confidence, not epistemic confidence\n\nWhen it comes to the impression you make on other people, being self-assured is more important than expressing certainty.\n\nPeople sometimes bemoan the fact that “superficial” things like posture and voice make such a difference in how we judge each other. But on the bright side, that means that projecting competence doesn’t require self-deception. You can boost your social confidence through practice speaking up in groups, hiring a speech coach, dressing better, improving your posture—all without compromising your ability to see things clearly.\n\nThe founding of Amazon is a case in point for the precedence of social confidence over epistemic confidence. The company’s big break came in the spring of 1996, when it received a visit from John Doerr, a partner at Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, one of the most prestigious venture capital firms in Silicon Valley (now just Kleiner Perkins). Doerr left that meeting wowed by Amazon and ready to invest. Even better, the interest from a high-profile venture capitalist triggered a bidding war that drove Amazon’s valuation up from $10 million to $60 million.\n\nSo, what exactly sold Doerr on Amazon? I’ll let him explain: “I walked into the door and this guy with a boisterous laugh who was just exuding energy comes bounding down the steps. In that moment, I wanted to be in business with Jeff.”\n\n1.  1.  Two kinds of uncertainty\n\nIf a doctor says, “I’m not sure what’s causing this,” it’s reasonable to wonder whether a better, more experienced doctor would be able to diagnose you.\n\nHowever, if the doctors sound like experts even while they’re giving an uncertain diagnosis. They’re offering useful context and they’re giving informative estimates rather than simply saying they don’t know.\n\n## Two kinds of uncertainty\n\n![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31969517/120054222-473a9080-c04c-11eb-8786-35e20a432ee3.png)\n\nWhen people claim that “admitting uncertainty” makes you look bad, they’re invariably conflating these two very different kinds of uncertainty: uncertainty “in you,” caused by your own ignorance or lack of experience, and uncertainty “in the world,” caused by the fact that reality is messy and unpredictable. The former is often taken as a bad sign about someone’s expertise, and justifiably so. But the latter is not—especially if you follow three rules for communicating uncertainty:\n\n\\- \\#\\# 1. Show that uncertainty is justified\n\nSometimes your audience won’t be aware of how much uncertainty exists “in the world” on the topic you’re speaking about, and they’ll expect you to give answers with more certainty than is actually possible. That’s okay; you just need to set their expectations.\n\nIn fact, if you show that certainty is unrealistic, you can be more persuasive than someone who states everything with 100 percent certainty. When an attorney meets with a potential client for the first time, the client always asks how much money they can expect to be awarded. It’s tempting for the attorney to give a confident, optimistic estimate, but the reality is that he doesn’t yet have enough information to go on. Instead, here’s what a prosecutor interviewed in How Leading Lawyers Think says in such a situation: “I tell them, ‘Any attorney who answers that either is lying to you or does not know what he’s doing, and you should run like hell.’”\n\n\\- \\#\\# 2. Give informed estimates\n\nEven if reality is messy and it’s impossible to know the right answer with confidence, you can at least be confident in your analysis.\n\nShowing that you’re well-informed and well prepared on a given topic doesn’t require you to overstate how much certainty is possible on that topic.\n\n\\- \\#\\# 3. Have a plan\n\nOne reason people don’t like hearing uncertain answers is that it leaves them at a loss for how to act. You can reassure them by following up your uncertainty with a plan or recommendation.\n\nHaving a plan means being able to make a strong case for what you are going to do to make your business a good bet—a bet that you feel confident about taking, and that other people can feel confident investing in, even though success isn’t guaranteed. In his 1999 CNBC interview, after acknowledging that Amazon was a risk, Jeff Bezos went on to explain why it was nevertheless a good risk to take:\n\nIt’s very, very hard to predict. But I believe that if you can focus obsessively enough on customer experience, selection, ease of use, low prices, more information to make purchase decisions with, if you can give customers all that plus great customer service . . . I think you have a good chance. And that’s what we’re trying to do.\n\n1.  1.  You don't need to promise success to be inspiring\n\n“You don’t have to psych them up by lying or by being overconfident about the chance of success.”\n\nYou can set ambitious goals. You can paint a vivid picture of the world you want to create. You can speak from the heart about why you personally care about this issue. All of those things can be inspiring, and none of them require you to make unrealistic claims.\n\n---\n\nyou don’t need to hold your opinions with 100 percent certainty in order to seem confident and competent. People simply aren’t paying that much attention to how much epistemic confidence you express. They’re paying attention to how you act, to your body language, tone, and other aspects of your social confidence, all of which are things you can cultivate without sacrificing your calibration.\n\nSecond, expressing uncertainty isn’t necessarily a bad thing. It depends on whether the uncertainty is “in you” or “in the world.” If you can demonstrate a strong command of the topic and speak with ease about your analysis and your plan, you’ll seem like more of an expert, not less.\n\nThird, you can be inspiring without overpromising. You can paint a picture of the world you’re trying to create, or why your mission is important, or how your product has helped people, without claiming you’re guaranteed to succeed. There are lots of ways to get people excited that don’t require you to lie to others or to yourself.\n\nwhatever your goal, there’s probably a way to get it that doesn’t require you to believe false things. From now on, whenever you hear someone claim that you need to self-deceive in order to be happy, motivated, or influential, you should raise a skeptical eyebrow. There are multiple paths to any goal, some of which involve self-deception and some of which don’t. It may take a little more care and practice to find the latter, but in the long run, it’s well worth it.\n\nThere are lots of ways to change the game board you’re playing on so that you end up with better choices, instead of simply resigning yourself to picking the least-bad choice currently in front of you.\n\n1.  How to Be Wrong\n    1.  Change your mind a little at a time\n\nYou’re probably already comfortable with the idea of changing your mind incrementally in some contexts. When you submit a job application, you might figure you have about a 5 percent chance of ultimately getting an offer. After they call you to set up an in-person job interview, your estimate might rise to about 10 percent. During the interview, if you feel like you’re hitting it out of the park, maybe your confidence in getting an offer rises to 30 percent. If you haven’t heard from them for a couple of weeks after your interview, your confidence might fall back down to 20 percent.\n\nWhat’s much rarer is for someone to do the same thing with their opinions about politics, morality, or other charged topics.\n\nChanging your mind frequently, especially about important beliefs, might sound mentally and emotionally taxing. But, in a way, it’s less stressful than the alternative. If you see the world in binary black-and-white terms, then what happens when you encounter evidence against one of your beliefs? The stakes are high: you have to find a way to dismiss the evidence, because if you can’t, your entire belief is in jeopardy.\n\nIf instead you see the world in shades of gray, and you think of “changing your mind” as an incremental shift, then the experience of encountering evidence against one of your beliefs is very different.\n\n1.  1.  Recognizing you were wrong makes you better at being right\n\nThis is another reason superforecasters are much happier to think about what they got wrong—they know that analyzing their errors is an opportunity to hone their technique. Lessons like “Don’t assume world leaders would react the same way as you” are like power-ups, upgrades to your mental arsenal that make you smarter going forward.\n\n1.  1.  Learning domain-general lessons\n\nWhen a forecaster recognizes he was wrong, it helps him make better forecasts. When an investor recognizes he was wrong, it helps him make better investments.\n\nthe biggest benefits of noticing your errors: the opportunity to improve your judgment in general.\n\nDomain-general, meaning that they apply to a wide variety of different domains, as opposed to domain-specific lessons that apply only to a single domain. Domain-general lessons are about how the world works, or how your own brain works, and about the kinds of biases that tend to influence your judgment.\n\n> It’s easy to be fooled by cherry-picked evidence.\n>\n> If it seems like someone is saying something dumb, I might be misunderstanding them.\n>\n> Even when I feel certain, there’s still a chance I’m wrong.\n\nou might think these principles sound obvious and that you know them already. But “knowing” a principle, in the sense that you read it and say, “Yes, I know that,” is different from having internalized it in a way that actually changes how you think.\n\nsuch knowledge doesn’t really become part of you until you’ve derived it for yourself by going through the experience of realizing you were wrong, asking yourself why, and seeing the effect of the bias at work.\n\nEven when you’re wrong about something random or trivial, there are still generally useful lessons to be had.\n\nscouts think about error differently from most people. First, they revise their opinions incrementally over time, which makes it easier to be open to evidence against their beliefs. Second, they view errors as opportunities to hone their skill at getting things right, which makes the experience of realizing “I was wrong” feel valuable, rather than just painful.\n\n1.  1.  Admitting a mistake vs Updating\n\nAn Assumption about changing your mind is that its humbling. That saying “I was wrong” is equivalent to saying “I screwed up”—something you confess with contrition or sheepishness. Indeed, that’s the standard way of thinking about being wrong. Even my fellow cheerleaders for changing one’s mind tend to say things like, “It’s okay to admit you were wrong\\!” While I appreciate the intentions behind this advice, I’m not sure it makes things much better. The word admit makes it sound like you screwed up but that you deserve to be forgiven because you’re only human. It doesn’t question the premise that being wrong means you screwed up.\n\ncouts reject that premise. You’ve learned new information and come to a new conclusion, but that doesn’t mean you were wrong to believe differently in the past. The only reason to be contrite is if you were negligent in some way. Did you get something wrong because you followed a process you should have known was bad? Were you willfully blind or stubborn or careless?\n\nBut most of the time, being wrong doesn’t mean you did something wrong. It’s not something you need to apologize for, and the appropriate attitude to have about it is neither defensive nor humbly self-flagellating, but matter-of-fact.\n\nInstead of “admitting a mistake,” scouts will sometimes talk about “updating.” That’s a reference to Bayesian updating, a technical term from probability theory for the correct way to revise a probability after learning new information. The way people use the word updating colloquially isn’t nearly so precise, but it still gestures at the spirit of revising one’s beliefs in response to new evidence and arguments.\n\n> Software engineer and product manager Devon Zuegel encourages readers to view her blog posts not as her permanent opinions, but instead as “a stream of thoughts, caught in the middle of updates.\"\n\nIf you start to think in terms of “updating” instead of “admitting you were wrong,” you may find that it takes a lot of friction out of the process. An update is routine. Low-key. It’s the opposite of an overwrought confession of sin. An update makes something better or more current without implying that its previous form was a failure.\n\n> “As I’ve gotten older, it’s gotten easier to be wrong, “Not even to be wrong. It’s just an update: I learned this new thing . . . what’s the issue?” - Emmett Shear\n\n1.  1.  If you're not changing your mind, you're doing something wrong\n\nOne thing that makes the Humane League unusual is their commitment to the premise that they’re always at least a little bit wrong.\n\nSwitching from one type of strategy or cause to another. In its early years, the Humane League concentrated on flashy demonstrations like picketing the homes of scientists involved in animal testing. But they found that this strategy was too alienating to be effective, and the number of animals it could save even in a best-case scenario wasn’t very high. That’s why they ultimately shifted their focus from lab animals to farm animals, and persuaded Unilever, which supplies 95 percent of the United States’ eggs, to agree to stop killing male chicks.\n\nKnowing that you’re fallible doesn’t magically prevent you from being wrong. But it does allow you to set expectations early and often, which can make it easier to accept when you are wrong. Coman-Hidy says, “My intuition is that if you bring up these biases a lot—that we are always going to think that we’re right, that we’re always thinking what we’re doing is the best and most important thing to be doing . . . it makes it an easier pill to swallow when inevitably something better comes along. Because you’ve kind of inoculated yourself against the ‘horror’ of having been suboptimal for some period of time.”\n\nDiscovering you were wrong is an update, not a failure, and your worldview is a living document meant to be revised. In the next chapter we’ll explore another key facet of changing your mind. Now that you’ve gotten good at being wrong, it’s time to get good at being confused.\n\n1.  Escape your echo chamber\n    1.  How not to learn from disagreement\n\nLearning from disagreement isn't hopeless—it’s that we’re going about it all wrong.\n","n":0.008}}},{"i":442,"$":{"0":{"v":"The Gay Science","n":0.577},"1":{"v":"\n- Title:  The Gay Science\n- Author(s): [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]\n- Reviewed date:  [[2022-02-28]]\n- Status: Unread\n- Areas: [[Nihilism]]\n\n---\n\n## Notes:\n\n-\n\n## Further lines of inquiry\n\n## Quote(s)\n\n## Resources mentioned\n","n":0.209}}},{"i":443,"$":{"0":{"v":"The Defining Decade","n":0.577},"1":{"v":"\n- Title: The Defining Decade: Why Your Twenties Matter And How to Make the Most of Them Now\n- Areas: [[areas.life]]\n- Author(s): Meg Jay\n- Status: unread\n\n---\n\n## Notes\n\n- You don't wanna wake up one day regretting that you should've lived more \"intentionally\"\n- autobiographically consequential experiences\n- Our generation is really confused as to what should be made of their twenties. Ours is the generation that was unlike the previous generation in many ways and that leaves us \"trying\" to figure out what to make of it. We're living as if \"disposable years lubricated by disposable income\".\n- We're led to believe that our twenties don't really matter that much, that we should have fun and not worry much. While TV and media fetishes and glamorizes a way of living that privileged twentysomethings get to live.\n- This causes too many men and women to squander the most transformative years of their adult lives, only to pay the price in decades to come.\n- No twentysomething is certain about anything in life. To help with this we've thousands of distractions, which we gleefully indulge in.\n- “What was I doing? What was I thinking?” is what we ask ourselves regretting over past twenties.\n- [[archive.identity capital]]\n- Twentysomethings imagine that identity crisis is for now and identity capital is for later when, in fact, crisis and capital can—and should—go together, like they did for [[Erikson|resources.people.erik erikson]].\n- Twentysomethings who take the time to explore and also have the nerve to make commitments along the way construct stronger identities. They have higher self-esteem and are more persevering and realistic. This path to identity is associated with a host of positive outcomes, including a clearer sense of self, greater life satisfaction, better stress management, stronger reasoning, and resistance to conformity.\n- More often, identities and careers are made not out of college majors and GPAs but out of a couple of door-opening pieces of identity capital.\n- underemployment - jobs you are overqualified for or work only part-time.\n- But some underemployment is not a means to an end. Sometimes it is just a way to pretend we aren’t working\n- While these sorts of jobs can be fun, they also signal to future employers a period of lostness. A degree from a university followed by too many unexplained retail and coffee-shop gigs looks backward. Those sorts of jobs can hurt our résumés and even our lives.\n- The longer it takes to get our footing in work, the more likely we are to become, as one journalist put it, “different and damaged.” Research on underemployed twentysomethings tells us that those who are underemployed for as little as nine months tend to be more depressed and less motivated than their peers—than even their unemployed peers.\n- Economists and sociologists agree that twentysomething work has an inordinate influence on our long-run career success. About two-thirds of lifetime wage growth happens in the first ten years of a career. After that, families and mortgages get in the way of higher degrees and cross-country moves, and salaries rise more slowly. As a twentysomething, it may feel like there are decades ahead to earn more and more but the latest data from the US Census Bureau shows that, on average, salaries peak—and plateau—in our forties.\n- Twentysomethings who think they have until later to leave unemployment or underemployment behind miss out on moving ahead while they are still traveling light. No matter how smoothly this goes, late bloomers will likely never close the gap between themselves and those who got started earlier.\n- Leaving you feeling shitfaced in your forties or thirties.\n- Fortunately, not all underemployment is the same. I always advise twentysomethings to take the job with the most capital. Identity capital.\n- One **good** piece of capital is _how_ you get to **better**.\n- **You can’t think your way through life. The only way to figure out what to do is to do—something.**\n- most things in adulthood, came to be because of what is called the strength of [[archive.weak ties]].\n- Many twentysomethings have limited themselves to huddling together with like-minded peers. Some are in almost constant contact with the same few people. But while the urban tribe helps us survive, it does not help us thrive.\n\n![[archive.weak ties]]\n\n![[archive.The Ben Franklin Effect]]\n\n## Quote(s)\n\n- The importance of these experiences was not necessarily clear at the time but, in retrospect, the subjects recognized that these events had sharply defined their futures. To a great extent, our lives are decided by far-reaching twentysomething moments we may not realize are happening at all.\n- By 2007, the twenties were dubbed the odyssey years, a time meant for wandering. And journalists and researchers everywhere began to refer to twentysomethings with silly nicknames such as kidults, pre-adults, and adultescents.\n- Even a new term **—amortality—** has been coined to describe living the same way, at the same pitch, from our teens until death.\n- Adults of all ages let what psychologists call “unrealistic optimism”—the idea that nothing bad will ever happen to you—overtake logic and reason. Adults of all backgrounds failed to do the math. Now twentysomethings have been set up to be another bubble ready to burst.\n- It seems everybody wants to be a twentysomething except for many twentysomethings themselves. All around, “thirty is the new twenty” is starting to get a new reaction: “God, I hope not.”\n- Uncertainty makes people anxious, and distraction is the twenty-first-century opiate of the masses. So twentysomethings like Kate are tempted, and even encouraged, to turn away and be twixters, to close their eyes and hope for the best.\n- We think that by avoiding decisions now, we keep all of our options open for later—but not making choices is a choice all the same.\n- The postmillennial midlife crisis is figuring out that while we were busy making sure we didn’t miss out on anything, we were setting ourselves up to miss out on some of the most important things of all. It is realizing that doing something later is not automatically the same as doing something better.\n- **Thirty is not the new twenty precisely because we settle down later than we used to. What this has done is made the twenties not an irrelevant downtime but a developmental sweet spot that comes only once.**\n- Erikson himself warned against spending too much time in “disengaged confusion.” He was concerned that too many young people were “in danger of becoming irrelevant.”\n\n## Look-into\n\n- [[archive.identity capital]]\n- navel-gazing\n- furrowed\n- “the Starbucks phase”\n- homophily\n","n":0.031}}},{"i":444,"$":{"0":{"v":"The Almanack Of Naval Ravikant","n":0.447},"1":{"v":"\n- Title: The Almanack Of Naval Ravikant\n- Areas: [[areas.Money]]\n- Author(s): [[Eric Jorgenson]]\n- Status: partially read\n\n---\n\nannotation-target::bin/files/The Almanack of Naval Ravikant.epub\n\n> %%\n>\n> ```annotation-json\n> {\"created\":\"2022-03-05T09:24:10.000Z\",\"updated\":\"2022-03-05T09:24:10.000Z\",\"document\":{\"title\":\"Eric-Jorgenson_The-Almanack-of-Naval-Ravikant_PRODUCTION_v102-9\",\"link\":[{\"href\":\"app://obsidian.md/index.html\"},{\"href\":\"app://obsidian.md/index.html?loc=Eric-Jorgenson_The-Almanack-of-Naval-Ravikant_PRODUCTION_v102-9.xhtml\",\"rel\":\"canonical\",\"type\":\"\"},{\"href\":\"urn:x-dc:urn%3Auuid%3A7697677f-8122-4630-a650-64103a10009e/Eric-Jorgenson_The-Almanack-of-Naval-Ravikant_PRODUCTION_v102-9\"}],\"dc\":{\"identifier\":[\"Eric-Jorgenson_The-Almanack-of-Naval-Ravikant_PRODUCTION_v102-9\"],\"relation.ispartof\":[\"urn:uuid:7697677f-8122-4630-a650-64103a10009e\"]},\"eprints\":{},\"facebook\":{},\"highwire\":{},\"prism\":{},\"twitter\":{},\"documentFingerprint\":\"urn:x-dc:urn%3Auuid%3A7697677f-8122-4630-a650-64103a10009e/Eric-Jorgenson_The-Almanack-of-Naval-Ravikant_PRODUCTION_v102-9\"},\"uri\":\"app://obsidian.md/index.html?loc=Eric-Jorgenson_The-Almanack-of-Naval-Ravikant_PRODUCTION_v102-9.xhtml\",\"target\":[{\"source\":\"app://obsidian.md/index.html?loc=Eric-Jorgenson_The-Almanack-of-Naval-Ravikant_PRODUCTION_v102-9.xhtml\",\"selector\":[{\"type\":\"RangeSelector\",\"startContainer\":\"/div[1]/p[46]\",\"startOffset\":1,\"endContainer\":\"/div[1]/p[46]\",\"endOffset\":76},{\"type\":\"TextPositionSelector\",\"start\":3780,\"end\":3855},{\"type\":\"TextQuoteSelector\",\"exact\":\"Give me a lever long enough and a place to stand, and I will move the earth\",\"prefix\":\" equity, and leverage.\\n\\t\\t\\t↓\\n\\t\\t\\t“\",\"suffix\":\".”\\n\\t\\t\\t—Archimedes\\n\\t\\t\\t↓\\n\\t\\t\\tFortun\"}]}]}\n> ```\n>\n> %%\n> _%%PREFIX%%equity, and leverage.\n> ↓\n> “%%HIGHLIGHT%% ==Give me a lever long enough and a place to stand, and I will move the earth== %%POSTFIX%%.”\n> —Archimedes\n> ↓\n> Fortun_\n> %%LINK%%[[#^tqk7rtqfzn|show annotation]]\n> %%COMMENT%%\n>\n> %%TAGS%%\n>\n> ^tqk7rtqfzn\n\n> %%\n>\n> ```annotation-json\n> {\"created\":\"2022-03-05T09:43:46.133Z\",\"updated\":\"2022-03-05T09:43:46.133Z\",\"document\":{\"title\":\"Eric-Jorgenson_The-Almanack-of-Naval-Ravikant_PRODUCTION_v102-9\",\"link\":[{\"href\":\"app://obsidian.md/index.html\"},{\"href\":\"app://obsidian.md/index.html?loc=Eric-Jorgenson_The-Almanack-of-Naval-Ravikant_PRODUCTION_v102-9.xhtml\",\"rel\":\"canonical\",\"type\":\"\"},{\"href\":\"urn:x-dc:urn%3Auuid%3A7697677f-8122-4630-a650-64103a10009e/Eric-Jorgenson_The-Almanack-of-Naval-Ravikant_PRODUCTION_v102-9\"}],\"dc\":{\"identifier\":[\"Eric-Jorgenson_The-Almanack-of-Naval-Ravikant_PRODUCTION_v102-9\"],\"relation.ispartof\":[\"urn:uuid:7697677f-8122-4630-a650-64103a10009e\"]},\"eprints\":{},\"facebook\":{},\"highwire\":{},\"prism\":{},\"twitter\":{},\"documentFingerprint\":\"urn:x-dc:urn%3Auuid%3A7697677f-8122-4630-a650-64103a10009e/Eric-Jorgenson_The-Almanack-of-Naval-Ravikant_PRODUCTION_v102-9\"},\"uri\":\"app://obsidian.md/index.html?loc=Eric-Jorgenson_The-Almanack-of-Naval-Ravikant_PRODUCTION_v102-9.xhtml\",\"target\":[{\"source\":\"app://obsidian.md/index.html?loc=Eric-Jorgenson_The-Almanack-of-Naval-Ravikant_PRODUCTION_v102-9.xhtml\",\"selector\":[{\"type\":\"RangeSelector\",\"startContainer\":\"/div[1]/p[130]\",\"startOffset\":0,\"endContainer\":\"/div[1]/p[130]\",\"endOffset\":438},{\"type\":\"TextPositionSelector\",\"start\":16749,\"end\":17187},{\"type\":\"TextQuoteSelector\",\"exact\":\"It’s much more important today to be able to become an expert in a brand-new field in nine to twelve months than to have studied the “right” thing a long time ago.

They have done everything right, sprinting at full speed while staying between the white lines, and their reward for historic conscientiousness is this: less ownership, more debt, and an age of existential catastrophe. . . . Why in the name of family, God, or country would such a person lust for ancient affiliations? As the kids say, \\#BurnItAllDown.”\n- While Hitchens pointed his dry wit and commentary toward all kinds of faith, including Buddhism and neo-paganism, Harris took particular issue with Islam and its apparent connection to the violence that had engulfed the world since 9/11. Although each thinker differed in emphasis, they could all agree on one thing: Religion, at its very roots, was a superstitious throwback, doomed to promote suffering and perpetuate ignorance.\n- Believing in virgin births or martyrs’ paradise, or a world divided into the saved and the damned, these skeptics insisted, was incompatible with modernity, common sense, and reason. At best, they argued, it was infantilizing. At worst, it provided justification for all sorts of horror. The time for Blind Faith was up, they agreed. These Four Horsemen of the New Atheism, as they were soon called, were only too happy to celebrate the End of Faith.\n- Those not drawn to the promise of the all-in-one Megachurch don’t always end up where Harris and Hitchens would have imagined—in the realm of reason and rationality. They often drift to the other extreme and fall into nihilism instead. Pew and Gallup don’t survey this particular group of the unchurched and unbelieving. But public health officials do, and their findings are sobering. Diseases of despair—anxiety, depression, suicide—are rampant. One in six Americans takes psychiatric medications just to cope with the banality of modern life. To put this in harsh relief, the World Health Organization reports that more people today kill themselves than die from all wars and natural disasters combined.\n- For sure, Nietzsche was arguing that the reason and logic of the French Enlightenment and scientific revolution had replaced blind faith. But, he said, there are profound social consequences to lobbing the Baby Jesus out with all that backward-ass bathwater. “When one gives up the Christian faith,” Nietzsche cautioned, “one pulls the right to Christian morality out from under one’s feet. This morality is by no means self-evident. . . . Christianity is a system, a whole view of things thought out together. By breaking one main concept out of it, the faith in God, one breaks the whole”\n- Walter Cronkite and BBC Radio no longer define the norms of polite debate and let us know, in soothing tones, that even if all is not right with the world, that right still leads the world.\n- we have to do the heavy lifting and sort through competing and conflicting sources ourselves. That requires graduating from simple, binary, either/or thinking toward both/and/neither thinking. Not only does this require an unusually high tolerance for ambiguity, it requires cultivating what Roger Martin, the dean of the Rotman School of Management, calls an “opposable mind” that can stay above the fray.\n- “We’ll take your vertically integrated supply chains, predatory lending, and profit margins,” said the Chinese Communist Party. “You can keep your uppity citizenry, human rights, and elections.”\n- When twenty-six people, who could all comfortably fit on a bus together (not that they’d ever ride one), own as much wealth as the poorer half of the world (nearly four billion people), you know we’re in a strange place. That sort of asymmetric resource accumulation has never existed in all of human history, or anywhere in nature, for that matter. And it all accrued during an era where democratic, technocratic, “rising tides lift all boats” trickle-down philosophies were the dominant story.

If the sound stutters increase the block size until the stutter stop\n\n- Frequency is measured in Hertz (Hz) – the number of times the signal does a complete oscillation in 1 second\n- Useful frequencies for sounds are about 20Hz – 20kHz\n- Frequency corresponds to the pitch of a note\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/zubayr/image/upload/v1658195519/wiki/qwd0jvr4tlnndqifzr0i.png)\n\nAdding a **VCA** to the mix\n\n## VCA\n\nVoltage Controlled Amplifier. In this context, an amplifier can change the level of a signal while keeping the same proportionate shape (and sound)\n\n**Chaining signals through modules**\n\n- We can chain the oscillator output signal through other modules (e.g. VCA) to further modify its sound\n- A core concept in modular synthesizers to chain a signal through modules\n- Each module in the chain can add a different modification to the signal\n- You can add as many links in the chain as you wan to achieve the sound you like\n- You can also split and combine signals to create chains that follow multiple paths\n\n## Oscilloscope\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/zubayr/image/upload/v1658196175/wiki/ftswuqzpnfp4si7sxg11.png)\n\nPatch the VCA output to IN 1. The scope shows the waveform of the electrical signal on the IN 1.

We can use these electrical signals to automate.\n\nThis type of signal is called **Control Voltage**.\n\nTo generate CVs we can use:\n\n- Sequencer\n- Input device (could also be mod wheel, pads, key velocity etc. etc.)\n\n## SEQ 3\n\nSequencer\n\nWe can generate CVs from a sequencer.\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/zubayr/image/upload/v1658199602/wiki/rokxxtvjhilnxjczjfhe.png)\n\nCV 1 from SEQ 3 to V/OCT of the VCO, Randomize SEQ 3\n\n## V/OCT\n\n1 Volt = 1 Octave change in pitch\n\n**Volt per Octave**\n\n- The V/OCT CV input to the oscillator will change the pitch by 1 octave for each volt at that input\n  – Equivalent to halving or doubling the frequency\n  – To move one semitone use 1/12th of a volt\n- `+ve` voltages go up, `-ve` voltages go down\n- Change is relative to the frequency set with the manual knobs\n\n- We can even chain CV signals through modules\n  – e.g. through a VCA to change the intensity of a CV\n- GATE is positive when a note is played\n- CV is V/OCT for the pitch of the last note\n\n## FM\n\n**Frequency Modulation** is added (FM) to the output, which is a small change in frequency controlled by a CV. Creates vibratos, slurs and zaps.\n\n## LFO\n\n**Low Frequency Oscillator**\n\nIs another important module. It should really be called a VCLFO, but I guess synth geeks like TLAs.\n\n- Essential functions are the same as the oscillator we already know, except it operates at lower frequencies.\n- Use it for vibrato or other repeating effects.\n- LFO SQR (square wave) outputs can also be used as “Clocks” to deliver regular pulses to modules that need pulse-inputs.\n- It has output modes: positive (UNI) and positive and negative (BI) voltage ranges.\n- `RESET` resets oscillator to the starting position (0 Volts).\n\n## ADSR\n\nAn Envelope Generator, commonly **Attack-Decay-Sustain-Release** (ADSR) module.\n\n- ADSR is an engineer’s model of how the loudness of a musical note changes as it is played\n- Value of the ADSR parameters can be set by control knobs and CVs.\n- Normally you connect the GATE input to a GATE output from a sequencer or keyboard.\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/zubayr/image/upload/v1658202139/wiki/urgnljzn4u8vfhhyhkhc.png)\n\n## Notes\n\n- Use a smooth analogue CV to vary the volume of a sound. Creates “natural” decay of notes and vibrato effects.\n- Add Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) to the oscillator square wave controlled by the CV. Creates “phasing” type sounds\n\n## Resources\n\n- [Intro to Eurorack (ft.

I think this book contains a lot of relevant information especially for technology entrepreneurs in their ideation, or project discovery phase.\n\n### Notes on questions to ask yourself in the project discovery phase\n\n1.  What important truth do very few people agree with you on?\n2.  What does everyone agree on? (Look out for delusional/conventional/popular beliefs)\n3.  What is the “backdrop” of your current technology? What are the things happening around you that people are talking about, that governments, investors, and the market as a whole are focusing on?\n4.  For your product to work, how many users will you need?\n5.  How can you partner up with notable companies to laud your growth/ comment positively?\n6.  How much of what you know about business is shaped by mistaken reactions to past mistakes? The most contrarian thing is not to oppose the crowd but to think for yourself.\n7.  What valuable company is nobody building? (Remember: Creating value is not enough. You also need to capture some of the value you create)\n8.  What valuable company is nobody building? (Every correct answer is necessarily a secret: something important and unknown, something hard to do but doable. If there are many secrets left in the world, there are probably many world-changing companies yet to be started)\n9.  How can you disguise your monopoly by framing your market as the union of several large markets? (For example, Google ->  search engine ∪ mobile phones ∪ wearable computers ∪ self-driving cars)\n10.  “Most of a tech company’s value will come at least 10 to 15 years in the future.” What value will you create 10-15 years later, from your initial idea today? (“For a company to be valuable it must grow and endure. Growth projections often in the form of numbers alone won’t tell you the answer; instead you must think critically about the qualitative characteristics of your business.\") Will this business still be around a decade from now? Evaluate your proposed idea based on durability as well.\n11.  “The perfect target market for a startup is a small group of particular people concentrated together and served by few or no competitors.” Who are your target market? Are they small enough? (A market is small enough if you are a monopoly when serving them)\n12.  “Once you create and dominate a niche market, then you should gradually expand into related and slightly broader markets. Amazon shows how it can be done. Jeff Bezos’s founding vision was to dominate all of online retail, but he very deliberately started with books”. What is your niche market? How do you plan to scale it into broader markets?\n13.  “Sequencing markets correctly is underrated, and it takes discipline to expand gradually.” What is your market sequencing strategy?\n14.  \"Indefinite optimism\" vs \"Definite optimism\"? In what way is your business idea and vision definitely optimistic?\n15.  “Apple imagined and executed definite multi-year plans to create new products and distribute them effectively.” What are your business’ definite multi-year plans? Do you have any?\n16.  What is your secret?\n17.  What’s the difference between really believing in your ideals and sticking to them vs pursuing some unrealistic dream that actually doesn’t have merit? Can you tell the difference between the two things?\n18.  How can computers help humans solve hard problems?\n19.  Engineering question: Can you create breakthrough technology instead of making little incremental improvements? Do you have proprietary technology an order of magnitude better than existing solutions? (10x)\n20.  Timing question: Is now the right time to start the business?\n21.  Monopoly question: Are you starting with a big share of a small niche market?\n22.  People question: Do you have the \"right team\"?\n23.  Distribution question: Do you have a plan of not just to create but distribute and deliver your product?\n24.  Durability question: Will your market position be defensible 20 - 30 years later?\n25.  Secret question: Have you identified a unique opportunity that others don’t see?\n26.  What is the underlying principle behind your idea/motivation to start a company?\n\n>   \n> **“To succeed, you must study the endgame before everything else.”**\n\n### Notes on lessons learnt\n\n1.  “If you want to create and capture lasting value, don’t build an undifferentiated commodity business.”\n2.  Conceal your monopoly—usually by exaggerating the power of your (nonexistent) competition.\n3.  “Entrepreneurs are always biased to understate the scale of competition, but that is the biggest mistake a startup can make. ” \\[Caution\\]\n4.  “Non-monopolists exaggerate their distinction by defining their market as the intersection of various smaller markets: British food ∩ restaurant ∩ Palo Alto\n5.  \"Monopolists, by contrast, disguise their monopoly by framing their market as the union of several large markets: search engine ∪ mobile phones ∪ wearable computers ∪ self-driving cars”\n6.  Be a creative monopoly:  “Monopolies drive progress because the promise of years or even decades of monopoly profits provides a powerful incentive to innovate. Then monopolies can keep innovating because profits enable them to make the long-term plans and to finance the ambitious research projects that firms locked in competition can’t dream of.”\n7.  “Competition can make people hallucinate opportunities where none exist.”\n8.  “A great business is defined by its ability to generate cash flows in the future. ”\n9.  “Comparing discounted cash flows shows the difference between low-growth businesses and high-growth startups at its starkest”\n10.  “Every monopoly is unique, but they usually share some combination of the following characteristics: 1. **proprietary technology**, 2. **network effects**, 3. **economies of scale**, and 4. **branding**.”\n11.  “A good startup should have the potential for great scale built into its first design.”\n12.  “Beginning with brand rather than substance is dangerous. No technology company can be built on branding alone.”\n13.  “Every startup is small at the start. Every monopoly dominates a large share of its market. Therefore, every startup should start with a very small market.”\n14.  “A definite person determines the one best thing to do and then does it. Instead of working tirelessly to make herself indistinguishable, she strives to be great at something substantive—to be a monopoly of one”’\n15.  For startups, deliberating through “intelligent design works best.”\n16.  “If you treat the future as something definite, it makes sense to understand it in advance and to work to shape it.”\n17.  “If you do start your own company, you must remember the Power law to operate it well. The most important things are singular: One market will probably be better than all others, as we discussed in Chapter 5. One distribution strategy usually dominates all others, too—for that see Chapter 11. Time and decision-making themselves follow a power law, and some moments matter far more than others—see Chapter 9.”\n18.  Think from first principles and innovate\n19.  Empower people, do not substitute them\n20.  There are two modes of progress: 1. Horizontal progress = Globalization, that is, taking things that work somewhere and making them work elsewhere.\n21.  2\\. Vertical progress = Technology. Any new and better way of doing things is technology.\n22.  “Spreading old ways to create wealth around the world will result in devastation, not riches. In a world of scarce resources, globalization without new technology is unsustainable.”\n23.  “New technology has never been an automatic feature of history.”\n24.  “Today our challenge is to both imagine and create the new technologies that can make the 21st century more peaceful and prosperous ”\n25.  By “monopoly”, we mean the kind of company that’s so good at what it does that no other firm can offer a close substitute.\n\n##### A small favor\n\nWas anything I wrote confusing, outdated, or incorrect?

Shopping, social media, porn, smoking, eating cookies, biting your nails. Some of these can be taken to a level of full-on addictions, but mostly their at a lower level that are just really hard to stop.\n\nThis isn’t a full guide on this topic, but some important ideas to play with.\n\n### Why We Have Compulsive Habits\n\nWe’re not idiots — we don’t do unhelpful things with the intent to harm ourselves, for the most part. We do them because the unhelpful habit is meeting some need.\n\nThe need might be something like:\n\n-   I’m bored and want a dopamine hit\n-   I feel bad about myself and want to do something pleasurable to take my mind off it\n-   I feel awkward in social situations and need a distraction\n-   I’m stressed and need a coping mechanism\n\nYou can see that these reasons are usually coping with something uncomfortable or stressful.\n\nThis is important to understand, because if you just stop doing the compulsive habit, you have removed your coping mechanism without finding another way to meet your need.\n\nWhat can you do to replace the compulsive habit, so that you can still meet your need? For quitting smoking, I tried meditation, running, pushups, journaling, massaging my shoulders, breathing, talking to people. You might try these or other ideas and see what helps you.\n\n### Remove Judgment, Add Compassion\n\nWe’re usually pretty judgmental about our compulsive habits. It’s a part of ourselves that we hate, or a confirmation that we’re somehow bad or inadequate.\n\nThis kind of harsh judgment is a defense mechanism meant to help us get better. If we’re harsh on ourselves for “bad” behavior, maybe we’ll get our act in order, right? Well, there’s mountains of research that shows this doesn’t work. Beating ourselves up only makes us crave our compulsive coping mechanisms, because now we feel bad about ourselves and are stressed out.\n\nWhat I’ve found to work far better is compassion for myself. I’m stressed about all this, why not give myself some compassion, just as I would a loved one? Why not assume I’m worthy of this kind of kindness and love, and help myself through the stress?\n\nCompassion is a healthy coping mechanism for stress, give it a try.\n\n### Persistent, Patient Commitment\n\nAsk yourself if you really want to commit yourself fully to this. Sleep on it, and ask yourself again, before you half commit. Do you really want to change this habit? It will come with difficulty, falling on your face, and a new way of seeing yourself. Is this something you want?\n\nIf the answer is absolutely yes … then commit yourself fully. Be all in. Set a Quit Date for 3 days from now.\n\nTell others about your commitment and ask them to hold you accountable. Promise to report to them every day or every week. Be as committed to this as you’ve been to anything in your life — your marriage, your kids, your job, your best friend.\n\nThen take the actions below.\n\n### Change Your Environment\n\nOn your Quit Date, take action to cut off easy access to your compulsive habit — throw out the cigarettes or cookies, have a friend change the password to your favorite shopping sites, use a site blocker that you don’t have the ability to change, delete the apps from your phone.\n\nChange your environment, so that you aren’t likely to do the old habit. Ask people who live and work with you to hold you accountable. I’ve told my kids they can smack me if they see me eat cookies, and they gleefully agree! I’ve asked people to hide the router until I finish writing a book chapter. I’ve gone to a coffee shop to write a book and told my family I wouldn’t come home until it’s done.\n\nMaking it hard to do the old compulsive habit is called “Creating a Moat.” Don’t let your future self, at a moment of weakness, have an easy time of falling back into the old habit. Make it easier to stick to the new habit, even if it’s not especially easy.\n\n### Don’t Do It Alone\n\nWhen we seek to change a habit that we think is embarrassing, we usually try to do it in private, so no one can see our shamefulness. This is a mistake. Doing it alone is very, very hard, and it also reinforces the idea that we are doing something shameful, and that we should be doing this on our own.\n\nIt’s stronger to do it with the help of others. Using other people’s support is just a more robust approach.\n\nAsk someone to be your accountability buddy, and promise to call them if you are feeling the urge to go back to your compulsive habit. Join an online forum ([my Fearless Living Academy](https://ignite.zenhabits.net/fla-founders) is a good choice!), and make a commitment to the people there. Or find a support group.\n\nYou don’t have to do this alone, nor should you. Do it with others who are on a similar journey, or who want to support you. You’ll have someone to encourage you when you’re not feeling strong enough.\n\n### Practice Awareness & the Powerful Pause\n\nWhen the compulsion to do the old habit happens, if you’re not aware of the urge, you’re likely to obey it without questioning it. It’s an imperative, without awareness.\n\nThe key is to develop awareness of the urge, so that you can notice it and not think of it as an imperative, but rather just a sensation in the body, and perhaps a thought (“Just one time is OK!”). With this kind of awareness, you now have a choice, and can question whether this is what you really want.\n\nThe practice of this is to introduce a Powerful Pause before you follow the urge. If you’re about to reach for the cookies, go on Amazon to shop, or open your favorite social media apps … notice that you’re about to do that action, and pause. Just for a few moments.\n\nThis Powerful Pause now allows you to bring awareness to the action you were about to take, and the urge that’s in your body to take that action. What does the urge feel like? Can you rest your attention on it for 10 seconds? Can you notice the stress or discomfort that’s making you want to cope with it using your old habit? Can you consider whether there’s another action that could help you cope with this in a healthier way?\n\nThat’s the Powerful Pause. Practice it meticulously.\n\n### Don’t Stop\n\nThis is a process of retraining the mind, and it takes time. You’ll relapse, falter, fall on your face. That’s how the process goes. If you think you’re doing it wrong, just keep going. Don’t stop.\n\nThe real magic happens when you fall on your face and then keep going. This is the real training. It’s when you’re in the mud and want to give up, but then you persist. It’s when you gave in to the cravings once more and are judging yourself, and then you breathe and try again.\n\nDon’t stop.

Brews distilled from yohimbe bark have been used for centuries by natives in this region in order to fuel their  \nunusually impressive tribal sex ceremonies, which are reported to sometimes last as long as two weeks.[1](http://www.sexanddrugs.info/#1)\n\nYohimbine, the most active chemical compound in the yohimbe bark, is actually available as a prescription drug in the United  \nStates for treating impotence. It is prescribed as an alternative to Viagra, due to the fact that it can also help facilitate erections in men. Research studies with yohimbine have shown it to be effective in helping men with impotence problems around 33 to 46 percent of the time.[2](http://www.sexanddrugs.info/#2) Some men that I've spoken with report that yohimbe actually gives them spontaneous erections, and that it also increases the amount of semen when they ejaculate.\n\nHowever, unlike Viagra, many men (and women) report that yohimbine (and yohimbe) also increases sexual desire. Yohimbine was the very first drug to ever be listed in the _[Physician's Desk Reference](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=1563634457/4538-5307408-460592 \"via Amazon.com\")_ (PDR) as having \"aphrodisiac\" properties, although (strangely) the PDR states that \"Generally, this drug is not proposed for use in females.\" There is little scientific data on the effects of yohimbe and yohimbine on women, although I�ve heard more than a few anecdotal reports that it can also increase sexual desire in women.\n\nSome people report that higher doses of yohimbe can have what are described as mild psychedelic effects that last for several  \nhours. This includes feelings of euphoria, heightened physical and emotional feelings, and \"warm spinal shivers\".[3](http://www.sexanddrugs.info/#3)\n\nHowever, higher doses of yohimbe cause some people to report that they feel anxious, and, according to the PDR, people  \nsometimes experience other mild side-effects with yohimbine, such as dizziness, nausea, tremors, increased blood pressure and  \nelevated heart rate. The PDR also cautions against yohimbine�s use in conjunction with antidepressant medications and other  \nmood-modifying drugs.\n\nReferences\n\n1.

There have been plenty of psychological explanations, usually involving the person’s insecurity and lack of vulnerability. The primary reason that people engage in this behavior, however, is a fundamental law of human desire that is rarely acknowledged:\n\n> **The desire that a person has for another person (or thing) is completely tied to how the desire for that person or thing is** **_modeled_** **to them by other people.**\n\nIn this article, I’m going to explain what that means.\n\nIf we understand how models of desire affect what we want, we can move through life with a better understanding of why we’re more attracted to certain people and things and not to others—and maybe even save ourselves from heartache. Most importantly, as we’ll see, we might begin to learn how to love better.\n\n## What Pickup Artists Know About Desire\n\nA book came out in 2005 called _[The Game: Penetrating the Secret World of Pickup Artists](https://www.amazon.com/Game-Penetrating-Secret-Society-Artists-ebook/dp/B007MAXHUG/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=the+game+penetrating&qid=1612717801&sr=8-1)._ The author, Neil Strauss, shares what he learned as part of a secret society of pickup artists.\n\nFrankly, I hate the book. It’s poorly written, and it celebrates psychological manipulation. I read it in 2005 because I was living in LA (starting my first company at the time) and met a member of the pickup artist community mentioned in the book. I was so repelled by him and by the Hollywood culture that I was newly immersed in that I bought the book to make sense of what I was experiencing. Who the hell are these people, I wondered?\n\nStrauss and his pickup artist friends had learned to _hack human desire_—and you should know how they did it.\n\nThe pickup artists exploited the most fundamental law of attraction: that what people want is determined through the influence of people who are _models of desire_.\n\nThe third chapter of _The Game_ is called “**Demonstrate Value**.” Strauss introduces the concept of what the pickup artists call a “pivot”:\n\n> _Pivot. n. a woman, usually a friend, used in social situations to help one meet other women. A pivot serves many functions: she provides social proof, she can create jealousy in the target...she can brag about the pickup artist to the target._\n\nIn reality, people don’t desire anything solely due to its objective qualities, or due to their independent evaluation. That’s just the story we tell ourselves.\n\nIn an age of hyperindividualism, that story is more powerful than ever. But it’s a lie.\n\nThe truth is that we want most things according to _how other people model the value of those things to us_. These people are models of desire.\n\nWe’ll see how this plays a role in the game of hard-to-get. But first, a quick primer on how models shape desire in general.\n\n**A freshman in high school has recently broken up with his girlfriend.** He’s sure that he isn’t attracted to her anymore. He hasn’t thought about her in weeks.\n\nThen he sees a picture of her on Instagram eating sushi on a date. She’s with a new guy—a good-looking junior athlete from his same school, by the way.\n\nSuddenly, his desire for her is inflamed. He now has a model—someone important to him, someone he aspires to be like—who desires his ex.\n\nHis newly inflamed desire for her is completely determined by his model, but he doesn’t realize it. He convinces himself that his new attraction is the result of “_realizing that he made a mistake_,” or “_seeing new qualities_” in her.\n\n[![](/assets/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F37bb5c27-02f2-47e8-9a8a-4600a16a68d8_899x1050.jpeg..jpeg)](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F37bb5c27-02f2-47e8-9a8a-4600a16a68d8_899x1050.jpeg)\n\nWhat he saw, of course, was a model: the right person wanting her, revealing her desirability in a way that instantly transfigured her before this poor freshman’s eyes.\n\n## About “Playing” Hard to Get\n\nThe French sociologist René Girard is the first one to fully explain how human desire is reliant on models. He called it _[mimetic](https://read.lukeburgis.com/p/mimetic-desire-101)_ [desire](https://read.lukeburgis.com/p/mimetic-desire-101). “Mimetic” is another way of saying “imitative.” We don’t desire anything directly—we imitate models.\n\nPeople even imitate the desire we have for _ourselves_. People that play hard to get know they are not simply objects of desire; they are also models for that same desire.\n\nA person who seems desperate for attention is baring his desires. He reveals how much he wants to be loved, to be known, to be admired.\n\nOf course, we _all_ want these things. The problem with showing it too much is that it decreases a person’s mimetic value in other peoples’ eyes.\n\nA person who does this is modeling their intense desire for approval, which makes us wonder why they need it so badly. We look around for other people (models) to make sure that we aren’t the only one who approves of them—to make sure, God forbid, that we aren’t the only one who likes them.\n\nWe’re all afraid of wanting the wrong things.\n\nOur freshman guy is now blowing up his ex’s phone, confessing his undying love for her. But she ignores him. And the more she ignores him, the more he wants her.\n\nMaybe she _is_ interested in getting back together with him—but she can’t let him know that. She makes sure he sees as many pictures of her with the handsome junior as possible. Her mimetic value increases with every picture she shares.\n\nBy playing hard to get, she’s modeling herself as desirable.\n\nThe most desirable things are the things we can’t have. Our models always seem to be _closer_ to those things than we are. That’s why they are models to us in the first place: we think (almost always, wrongly) that they either have or are closer to having something that we do not.\n\nThis is why most of us spend our lives on a never-satisfied search for the next object of desire. There is _always_ another model somewhere making us wonder if what they want, we should be what we want, too.\n\nThe danger with models is this: if our desire is determined by models, _then our desire is not entirely our own_.\n\nOrganizational psychologist and author [Adam Grant](https://twitter.com/AdamMGrant) refers to some people as “Maximizers.” They look to maximize their decisions for the absolute _best_ outcome every step of the way.\n\nHe cites a study of college grads to explain. Some grads, he found, to “maximize” the impact of their first job out of college; others simply looked for the “best fit” and didn’t obsess over the quality of the job opportunity relative to their peers.\n\nGrant writes:\n\n> “Here’s the surprise: despite doing better, maximizers actually felt worse. They experienced more negative emotions during the job search, were less satisfied with the jobs they accepted, and were more likely to question whether they made the right decision. Why? They spent more time comparing their outcomes to their peers to figure out whether they really had the “best” job, and ruminated more about “what if” scenarios. Searching for the best made them less happy.”\n\nThe non-stop comparison game that Maximizers play usually makes them miserable. We could say that maximizers are more driven by mimetic desire than the “Satisificers”—those who are satisfied with finding “the right fit” rather than needing to maximize every outcome.\n\n[![](/assets/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc6e11ec5-9ff8-42b6-a3fd-f7872e4c31c4_899x1350.png..png)](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc6e11ec5-9ff8-42b6-a3fd-f7872e4c31c4_899x1350.png)\n\n(There’s nothing wrong with aiming for the best; but it can easily lead to a Sysphean tragedy because what we believe is the “best” is often determined by **models**. And there are always new models. The key is knowing when to be a Maximizer and when to be a Satisficer.)\n\nNow let’s turn back to Freshmanistan to see how this story ends.\n\n## The Tragedy of Clubhouse Love\n\nWe not only want the things that we can’t have; we _don’t_ want things unless other people want them, too.\n\nOur freshman guy starts dating a new girl now. But he desperately seeks the approval of his friends. He takes her to parties, he introduces her to everyone he knows. Secretly, he wants one of them to be wildly attracted to her. He is actually _looking for a rival_.\n\nIf he can’t find one, he’ll begin to doubt whether he made the right choice—he’ll begin to doubt whether he really wants to be with this new girl, after all.\n\n**If nobody seems interested in pursuing her, then she** **\\*wasn’t hard enough to get\\*\\*\\***.\\*\\* And that—from the standpoint of mimetic desire—is our worst fear.\n\nMost of us go through life like mini-masochists, constantly worried that our achievements must not be achievements if we managed to achieve them. We are like Grouch Marx, who didn’t want to belong to any club that would have him as a member.\n\n[![](/assets/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc51949b5-dc59-44af-b652-aa0b8cb50f64_635x334.jpeg..jpeg)](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc51949b5-dc59-44af-b652-aa0b8cb50f64_635x334.jpeg)\n\nTo paraphrase René Girard: we set out in search of the one thing we think we truly want, which we believe must be hidden under the one rock that is too heavy for us to lift.\n\n**If we get something that we wanted, we believe we must have wanted the wrong thing. We go in search of a new model.**\n\nI would love to live in a world where I never felt pressure to posture about how hard I am to reach, or how busy I am, or how hard other people should have to work to be with me. (I gave up this game on a _romantic_ level in my twenties. But I still feel the pressure in my professional life—lest anyone undervalue me because I’m too easy to reach! I am speaking partly in jest, but partly not. In the business world, deals are won and lost based largely on mimetic value, not objective value.)\n\nBut a world in which nobody cared about what other people want would be a little less human. Mimetic desire is the most human experience of all. As far as we know, animals aren’t caught in a never-satisfied striving to achieve the lifestyle of other animals. They establish a dominance hierarchy, and it’s relatively stable. Us? We’re caught up in an ever-changing sea of desires.\n\nEach of us cares deeply about what other people care about. We care what other people want.\n\nIn the end, I think **playing hard to get is easy, and being easy to get is hard.**\n\nIt means overcoming that initial impulse of pride that makes us want to make other people work really hard to get to us. It means being accessible, open, vulnerable—making an unmerited gift of ourselves to others. Another word for that is love.\n","n":0.024}}},{"i":469,"$":{"0":{"v":"What Books Should Everyone Read","n":0.447},"1":{"v":"\n[What Books Should Everyone Read?](https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/3253/what-books-should-everyone-read)\n","n":0.447}}},{"i":470,"$":{"0":{"v":"Webmark","n":1}}},{"i":471,"$":{"0":{"v":"The Egg","n":0.707},"1":{"v":"\n- Source: http://www.galactanet.com/oneoff/theegg_mod.html\n- Author: Andy Weir\n\n***\n\n# The Egg\n\n> ## Excerpt\n> Author's Note: The Egg is also available in the following languages:\n\n---\n_Author's Note: The Egg is also available in the following languages:_\n\n**The Egg**\n\nBy: Andy Weir\n\nYou were on your way home when you died.\n\nIt was a car accident. Nothing particularly remarkable, but fatal nonetheless. You left behind a wife and two children. It was a painless death. The EMTs tried their best to save you, but to no avail. Your body was so utterly shattered you were better off, trust me.\n\nAnd that’s when you met me.\n\n“What… what happened?” You asked. “Where am I?”\n\n“You died,” I said, matter-of-factly. No point in mincing words.\n\n“There was a… a truck and it was skidding…”\n\n“Yup,” I said.\n\n“I… I died?”\n\n“Yup. But don’t feel bad about it. Everyone dies,” I said.\n\nYou looked around. There was nothingness. Just you and me. “What is this place?” You asked. “Is this the afterlife?”\n\n“More or less,” I said.\n\n“Are you god?” You asked.\n\n“Yup,” I replied. “I’m God.”\n\n“My kids… my wife,” you said.\n\n“What about them?”\n\n“Will they be all right?”\n\n“That’s what I like to see,” I said. “You just died and your main concern is for your family. That’s good stuff right there.”\n\nYou looked at me with fascination. To you, I didn’t look like God. I just looked like some man. Or possibly a woman. Some vague authority figure, maybe. More of a grammar school teacher than the almighty.\n\n“Don’t worry,” I said. “They’ll be fine. Your kids will remember you as perfect in every way. They didn’t have time to grow contempt for you. Your wife will cry on the outside, but will be secretly relieved. To be fair, your marriage was falling apart. If it’s any consolation, she’ll feel very guilty for feeling relieved.”\n\n“Oh,” you said. “So what happens now? Do I go to heaven or hell or something?”\n\n“Neither,” I said. “You’ll be reincarnated.”\n\n“Ah,” you said. “So the Hindus were right,”\n\n“All religions are right in their own way,” I said. “Walk with me.”\n\nYou followed along as we strode through the void. “Where are we going?”\n\n“Nowhere in particular,” I said. “It’s just nice to walk while we talk.”\n\n“So what’s the point, then?” You asked. “When I get reborn, I’ll just be a blank slate, right? A baby. So all my experiences and everything I did in this life won’t matter.”\n\n“Not so!” I said. “You have within you all the knowledge and experiences of all your past lives. You just don’t remember them right now.”\n\nI stopped walking and took you by the shoulders. “Your soul is more magnificent, beautiful, and gigantic than you can possibly imagine. A human mind can only contain a tiny fraction of what you are. It’s like sticking your finger in a glass of water to see if it’s hot or cold. You put a tiny part of yourself into the vessel, and when you bring it back out, you’ve gained all the experiences it had.\n\n“You’ve been in a human for the last 48 years, so you haven’t stretched out yet and felt the rest of your immense consciousness. If we hung out here for long enough, you’d start remembering everything. But there’s no point to doing that between each life.”\n\n“How many times have I been reincarnated, then?”\n\n“Oh lots. Lots and lots. An in to lots of different lives.” I said. “This time around, you’ll be a Chinese peasant girl in 540 AD.”\n\n“Wait, what?” You stammered. “You’re sending me back in time?”\n\n“Well, I guess technically. Time, as you know it, only exists in your universe. Things are different where I come from.”\n\n“Where you come from?” You said.\n\n“Oh sure,” I explained “I come from somewhere. Somewhere else. And there are others like me. I know you’ll want to know what it’s like there, but honestly you wouldn’t understand.”\n\n“Oh,” you said, a little let down. “But wait. If I get reincarnated to other places in time, I could have interacted with myself at some point.”\n\n“Sure. Happens all the time. And with both lives only aware of their own lifespan you don’t even know it’s happening.”\n\n“So what’s the point of it all?”\n\n“Seriously?” I asked. “Seriously? You’re asking me for the meaning of life? Isn’t that a little stereotypical?”\n\n“Well it’s a reasonable question,” you persisted.\n\nI looked you in the eye. “The meaning of life, the reason I made this whole universe, is for you to mature.”\n\n“You mean mankind? You want us to mature?”\n\n“No, just you. I made this whole universe for you. With each new life you grow and mature and become a larger and greater intellect.”\n\n“Just me? What about everyone else?”\n\n“There is no one else,” I said. “In this universe, there’s just you and me.”\n\nYou stared blankly at me. “But all the people on earth…”\n\n“All you. Different incarnations of you.”\n\n“Wait. I’m _everyone_!?”\n\n“Now you’re getting it,” I said, with a congratulatory slap on the back.\n\n“I’m every human being who ever lived?”\n\n“Or who will ever live, yes.”\n\n“I’m Abraham Lincoln?”\n\n“And you’re John Wilkes Booth, too,” I added.\n\n“I’m Hitler?” You said, appalled.\n\n“And you’re the millions he killed.”\n\n“I’m Jesus?”\n\n“And you’re everyone who followed him.”\n\nYou fell silent.\n\n“Every time you victimized someone,” I said, “you were victimizing yourself. Every act of kindness you’ve done, you’ve done to yourself. Every happy and sad moment ever experienced by any human was, or will be, experienced by you.”\n\nYou thought for a long time.\n\n“Why?” You asked me. “Why do all this?”\n\n“Because someday, you will become like me. Because that’s what you are. You’re one of my kind. You’re my child.”\n\n“Whoa,” you said, incredulous. “You mean I’m a god?”\n\n“No. Not yet. You’re a fetus. You’re still growing.

The topology information is flooded throughout the AS, so that every router within the AS has a complete picture of the topology of the AS. This picture is then used to calculate end-to-end paths through the AS, normally using a variant of the Dijkstra algorithm. Therefore, in a link-state routing protocol, the next hop address to which data is forwarded is determined by choosing the best end-to-end path to the eventual destination.\n","n":0.076}}},{"i":482,"$":{"0":{"v":"The days are long but the decades are short - Sam Altman","n":0.289},"1":{"v":"\n- Source: https://blog.samaltman.com/the-days-are-long-but-the-decades-are-short\n- Author: \n\n***\n\n# The days are long but the decades are short - Sam Altman\n\n---\n_I turned 30 last week and a friend asked me if I'd figured out any life advice in the past decade worth passing on.  I'm somewhat hesitant to publish this because I think these lists usually seem hollow, but here is a cleaned up version of my answer:_  \n\n1) Never put your family, friends, or significant other low on your priority list.  Prefer a handful of truly close friends to a hundred acquaintances.  Don’t lose touch with old friends.  Occasionally stay up until the sun rises talking to people.  Have parties.  \n\n2) Life is not a dress rehearsal—this is probably it.  Make it count.  Time is extremely limited and goes by fast.  Do what makes you happy and fulfilled—few people get remembered hundreds of years after they die anyway.  Don’t do stuff that doesn’t make you happy (this happens most often when other people want you to do something).  Don’t spend time trying to maintain relationships with people you don’t like, and cut negative people out of your life.  Negativity is really bad.  Don’t let yourself make excuses for not doing the things you want to do.\n\n3) How to succeed: pick the right thing to do (this is critical and usually ignored), focus, believe in yourself (especially when others tell you it’s not going to work), develop personal connections with people that will help you, learn to identify talented people, and work hard.  It’s hard to identify what to work on because original thought is hard.\n\n4) On work: it’s difficult to do a great job on work you don’t care about.  And it’s hard to be totally happy/fulfilled in life if you don’t like what you do for your work.  Work very hard—a surprising number of people will be offended that you choose to work hard—but not so hard that the rest of your life passes you by.  Aim to be the best in the world at whatever you do professionally.  Even if you miss, you’ll probably end up in a pretty good place.  Figure out your own productivity system—don’t waste time being unorganized, working at suboptimal times, etc.  Don’t be afraid to take some career risks, especially early on.  Most people pick their career fairly randomly—really think hard about what you like, what fields are going to be successful, and try to talk to people in those fields.\n\n5) On money: Whether or not money can buy happiness, it can buy freedom, and that’s a big deal.  Also, lack of money is very stressful.  In almost all ways, having enough money so that you don’t stress about paying rent does more to change your wellbeing than having enough money to buy your own jet.  Making money is often more fun than spending it, though I personally have never regretted money I’ve spent on friends, new experiences, saving time, travel, and causes I believe in.\n\n6) Talk to people more.  Read more long content and less tweets.  Watch less TV.  Spend less time on the Internet.\n\n7) Don’t waste time.  Most people waste most of their time, especially in business.\n\n8) Don’t let yourself get pushed around.  As Paul Graham once said to me, “People can become formidable, but it’s hard to predict who”.  (There is a big difference between confident and arrogant.  Aim for the former, obviously.)\n\n9) Have clear goals for yourself every day, every year, and every decade. \n\n10) However, as valuable as planning is, if a great opportunity comes along you should take it.  Don’t be afraid to do something slightly reckless.  One of the benefits of working hard is that good opportunities will come along, but it’s still up to you to jump on them when they do.\n\n11) Go out of your way to be around smart, interesting, ambitious people.  Work for them and hire them (in fact, one of the most satisfying parts of work is forging deep relationships with really good people).  Try to spend time with people who are either among the best in the world at what they do or extremely promising but totally unknown.  It really is true that you become an average of the people you spend the most time with.\n\n12) Minimize your own cognitive load from distracting things that don’t really matter.  It’s hard to overstate how important this is, and how bad most people are at it.  Get rid of distractions in your life.  Develop very strong ways to avoid letting crap you don’t like doing pile up and take your mental cycles, especially in your work life.\n\n13) Keep your personal burn rate low.  This alone will give you a lot of opportunities in life.\n\n14) Summers are the best.\n\n15) Don’t worry so much.  Things in life are rarely as risky as they seem.  Most people are too risk-averse, and so most advice is biased too much towards conservative paths.\n\n16) Ask for what you want.  \n\n17) If you think you’re going to regret not doing something, you should probably do it.  Regret is the worst, and most people regret far more things they didn’t do than things they did do.  When in doubt, kiss the boy/girl.\n\n18) Exercise.  Eat well.  Sleep.  Get out into nature with some regularity.\n\n19) Go out of your way to help people.  Few things in life are as satisfying.  Be nice to strangers.  Be nice even when it doesn’t matter.\n\n20) Youth is a really great thing.  Don’t waste it.  In fact, in your 20s, I think it’s ok to take a “Give me financial discipline, but not just yet” attitude.  All the money in the world will never get back time that passed you by.\n\n21) Tell your parents you love them more often.  Go home and visit as often as you can.\n\n22) This too shall pass.\n\n23) Learn voraciously. \n\n24) Do new things often.  This seems to be really important.  Not only does doing new things seem to slow down the perception of time, increase happiness, and keep life interesting, but it seems to prevent people from calcifying in the ways that they think.  Aim to do something big, new, and risky every year in your personal and professional life.\n\n25) Remember how intensely you loved your boyfriend/girlfriend when you were a teenager?  Love him/her that intensely now.  Remember how excited and happy you got about stuff as a kid?  Get that excited and happy now.\n\n26) Don’t screw people and don’t burn bridges.  Pick your battles carefully.\n\n27) Forgive people. \n\n28) Don’t chase status.  Status without substance doesn’t work for long and is unfulfilling.\n\n29) Most things are ok in moderation.  Almost nothing is ok in extreme amounts.\n\n30) Existential angst is part of life.  It is particularly noticeable around major life events or just after major career milestones.  It seems to particularly affect smart, ambitious people.  I think one of the reasons some people work so hard is so they don’t have to spend too much time thinking about this.  Nothing is wrong with you for feeling this way; you are not alone.\n\n31) Be grateful and keep problems in perspective.  Don’t complain too much.  Don’t hate other people’s success (but remember that some people will hate your success, and you have to learn to ignore it). \n\n32) Be a doer, not a talker.\n\n33) Given enough time, it is possible to adjust to almost anything, good or bad.  Humans are remarkable at this.\n\n34) Think for a few seconds before you act.  Think for a few minutes if you’re angry.\n\n35) Don’t judge other people too quickly.  You never know their whole story and why they did or didn’t do something.  Be empathetic.\n\n36) The days are long but the decades are short.\n","n":0.029}}},{"i":483,"$":{"0":{"v":"The Best Book Recommendations — Alex & Books","n":0.354},"1":{"v":"\n- Source: https://alexandbooks.com/bestbooks\n- Author: \n\n***\n\n# The Best Book

With the majority of the research done upfront, [estimates of the time needed](https://www.workfront.com/project-management/methodologies/agile/story-points) for each requirement are more accurate, and this can provide a more predictable release date. With a Waterfall project, if parameters change along the way, it’s harder to change course than it is with [Agile methodology](https://www.workfront.com/project-management/methodologies/agile).\n\n---\n\n**Ebook:** [20 Experts Share Secrets For Balancing Agile and Waterfall](https://www.workfront.com/resources/20-experts-share-secrets-for-balancing-agile-and-waterfall)\n\n**Whitepaper:** [The Manager's Guide to Mixing Agile and Waterfall](https://www.workfront.com/resources/solve-the-pain-of-mixing-agile-and-waterfall)\n\n---\n\n## 5 common stages in a Waterfall process\n\nThe Waterfall methodology follows a chronological process and works based on fixed dates, requirements, and outcomes. With this method, the individual execution teams aren’t required to be in constant communication and, unless specific integrations are required, are usually self-contained. Team members also tend to work independently and aren’t expected to provide [status reports](https://www.workfront.com/project-management/life-cycle/monitoring-controlling/status-reports) as often as with the Agile approach. Usually, one phase doesn’t begin until the previous one is finished.\n\n![The 5 stages of the waterfall method process](inbox/assets/The%205%20stages%20of%20the%20waterfall%20method%20process.png)\n\nUsing a software development project as an example, the Waterfall process usually includes stages that look like this:\n\n### Requirements\n\nThe Waterfall methodology depends on the belief that all [project requirements](https://www.workfront.com/project-management/knowledge-areas/scope-management/requirements-management) can be gathered and understood upfront. The [project manager](https://www.workfront.com/project-management/career/project-manager) does their best to get a detailed understanding of the project sponsor’s requirements. Written requirements, usually contained in a single document, are used to describe each stage of the project, including the [costs](https://www.workfront.com/project-management/knowledge-areas/cost-management), assumptions, [risks](https://www.workfront.com/project-management/knowledge-areas/risk-management), dependencies, [success metrics](https://www.workfront.com/project-management/metrics), and [timelines](https://www.workfront.com/project-management/knowledge-areas/time-management/project-timeline) for completion.\n\n### Design\n\nHere, software developers design a technical solution to the problems set out by the product requirements, including scenarios, layouts, and data models. First, a higher-level or logical design is created that describes the purpose and [scope of the project](https://www.workfront.com/project-management/knowledge-areas/scope-management/project-scope), the general traffic flow of each component, and the integration points. Once this is complete, it is transformed into a physical design using specific hardware and software technologies.\n\n### Implementation\n\nOnce the design is complete, technical implementation starts. This might be the shortest phase of the Waterfall process, because painstaking research and design have already been done. In this phase, programmers code applications based on project requirements and specifications, with some testing and implementation taking place as well. If significant changes are required during this stage, this may mean going back to the design phase.\n\n### Verification or testing\n\nBefore a product can be released to customers, testing needs to be done to ensure the product has no errors and all of the requirements have been completed, ensuring a good user experience with the software. The testing team will turn to the design documents, personas, and user case scenarios supplied by the product manager to create their test cases.\n\n### Deployment and maintenance\n\nOnce the software has been deployed in the market or released to customers, the maintenance phase begins. As defects are found and change requests come in from users, a team will be assigned to take care of updates and release new versions of the software.\n\n## Advantages of the Waterfall methodology\n\nThe Waterfall methodology is a straightforward, well-defined [project management methodology](https://www.workfront.com/project-management/methodologies) with a proven track record. Since the requirements are clearly laid out from the beginning, each contributor knows what must be done when, and they can effectively plan their time for the duration of the project.\n\nOther benefits of the Waterfall method include:\n\n- Developers can catch design errors during the analysis and design stages, helping them to avoid writing faulty code during the implementation phase.\n- The total cost of the project can be accurately estimated, as can the timeline, after the requirements have been defined.\n- With the structured approach, it is easier to measure progress according to clearly defined milestones.\n- Developers who join the project in progress can easily get up to speed because everything they need to know should be in the requirements document.\n- Customers aren’t always adding new requirements to the project, delaying production.\n\n## Disadvantages of the Waterfall methodology\n\nLike any development process, the strengths in one area might mean weaknesses in the other. The Waterfall methodology’s insistence on upfront [project planning](https://www.workfront.com/project-management/life-cycle/planning) and commitment to a certain defined progress means that it is less flexible, or agile, later in the game. Changes that come further in the process can be time-consuming, painful, and costly.\n\nOther reasons the Waterfall methodology [may not work](https://www.workfront.com/blog/5-reasons-your-project-management-process-isnt-working) include:\n\n- Projects can take longer to deliver with this chronological approach than with an iterative one, such as the Agile method.\n- Clients often don’t fully know what they want at the front end, opening the door to requests for changes and new features later in the process when they’re harder to accommodate.\n- Clients are not involved in the design and implementation stages.\n- Deadline creep—when one phase in the process is delayed, all the other phases are delayed.\n\n---\n\n**Whitepaper:** [Creating a Process That Works](https://www.workfront.com/resources/creating-a-process-that-works)\n\n**Ebook:** [11 Lessons That Will Make Your IT Team Faster, Happier, and More Productive](https://www.workfront.com/resources/11-lessons-that-will-make-your-it-team-faster-happier-and-more-productive)\n\n---\n\n## Who uses the Waterfall model?\n\nThe Waterfall process is adopted by project managers who are faced with development projects that:\n\n- Don’t have ambiguous requirements.\n- Offer a clear picture of how things will proceed from the outset.\n- Have clients who seem unlikely to change the scope of the project once it is underway.\n\nIf a project manager prefers clearly defined processes, where cost, design, and [time requirements](https://www.workfront.com/project-management/knowledge-areas/time-management) are known upfront, then the Waterfall method is the way to go, as long as the project itself is conducive to those constraints.\n\n## Waterfall project management FAQs \n\n### What is the difference between the Waterfall and Agile approaches to project management?\n\nWhile the Waterfall model relies on thorough up-front planning in which each phase must be  fully completed before the next one starts, Agile is a more flexible, iterative process that tackles the planning, design, implementation, and testing tasks in shorter, repeating cycles.\n\nWith Waterfall, the customer doesn’t usually play a hands-on role once their requirements have been collected. With Agile, the customer has greater input throughout development. Instead of having Waterfall milestones, Agile works in “[sprints](https://www.workfront.com/project-management/methodologies/scrum/sprints),” where prioritized tasks are completed in short windows of time, such as two weeks.\n\nLearn more about [Agile vs. Waterfall](https://www.workfront.com/project-management/methodologies/agile/agile-vs-waterfall)\n\n### When can design changes be made in the Waterfall process?\n\nAlterations are easy to accommodate in the early stages of development, such as when the project manager is still fleshing out the specification documents with the development team and clients. Later in the Waterfall process, once coding has already begun, design changes can be difficult and expensive to make.\n\n### What other benefits are there to Waterfall’s organized structure?\n\nWhile the Waterfall methodology may sound overly restrictive for certain kinds of projects, it can be a great way to keep a well-defined, predictable project from exceeding time and budget guidelines. The clear and detailed organization can also help during complex projects that involve a lot of people working toward a clearly outlined goal.\n","n":0.029}}},{"i":491,"$":{"0":{"v":"Waiting for apt locks without the hacky bash scripts","n":0.333},"1":{"v":"\n- Areas: [[devlog.linux]]\n\n---\n\n[Waiting for apt locks without the hacky bash scripts](https://blog.sinjakli.co.uk/2021/10/25/waiting-for-apt-locks-without-the-hacky-bash-scripts/)\n","n":0.302}}},{"i":492,"$":{"0":{"v":"Vim Clutch","n":0.707},"1":{"v":"\n[Vim Clutch](https://l-o-o-s-e-d.net/vim-clutch)\n","n":0.707}}},{"i":493,"$":{"0":{"v":"Unix & Linux","n":0.577},"1":{"v":"\n[Unix & Linux](https://unix.stackexchange.com/)\n","n":0.577}}},{"i":494,"$":{"0":{"v":"Tweets","n":1}}},{"i":495,"$":{"0":{"v":"SahilBloom - 1492855907000238081","n":0.577},"1":{"v":"\n![SahilBloom](assets/SahilBloom-312681953.jpg)\nSahil Bloom ([@SahilBloom](https://twitter.com/SahilBloom))\n\n10 ways to stand out in a hiring process (that don’t involve your resume):\n\n[Tweet link](https://twitter.com/SahilBloom/status/1492855907000238081)\n\n---\n\n![SahilBloom](assets/SahilBloom-312681953.jpg)\nSahil Bloom ([@SahilBloom](https://twitter.com/SahilBloom))\n\nDo Your Research\n\nBefore an interview, spend a few hours researching the company and role.\n\nAt a minimum, you should cover:\n\n• Company mission\n\n• Recent company news\n\n• Recent market news\n\n• Backgrounds of leaders\n\n• Backgrounds of interviewers\n\nGoogle is a powerful asset—use it.\n\n[Tweet link](https://twitter.com/SahilBloom/status/1492855907939758081)\n\n---\n\n![SahilBloom](assets/SahilBloom-312681953.jpg)\nSahil Bloom ([@SahilBloom](https://twitter.com/SahilBloom))\n\nEmbrace “I Don’t Know”\n\nYou can’t know the answer to every question.

But most importantly I’ve found that being independent requires a level of introspection and self-reflection that few talk about.\n\nSo I'm writing a book - serialized free online - about the art and science of independent consulting. Shipping end of 2021.\n\n### 1\\. Becoming Independent\n\n*What does it mean to be a \"strategic independent\"? How do you create a narrative arc for yourself that allows you to step out into the unknown of independent work?*\n\nHow to do better work for more money, whether you're a designer, writer or strategist.\n\nNarrative Institutions (draft)\n\nHow to manage your identity during the transition to independent\n\n### 2\\. Finding Work\n\n*The number one problem most independent consultants face is finding clients. The default mode of searching for \"productized services\" however is usually wrong. Instead we need to increase our presence across the networks we're surrounded by.*\n\nNetwork topology and the ghost of the digg homepage\n\nHow to generate leads for an independent consulting practice\n\nHow to find the “dark leads” hiding in your network to generate client work\n\nSpeak, Consultant (in draft)\n\nExamining the unreasonable effectiveness of \"voice\" (podcasts, conferences etc) on generating consulting leads.\n\n### 3\\. Ways of Seeing\n\n*The soft skills of understanding a client's culture and understanding your point of contact's blind spots and broken mental models unlocks great potential for the consultant to create new mental models and help clients see in new ways.*\n\nAnd how to create clarity in consulting work\n\nWhy (their) culture eats (your) strategy for breakfast\n\nHow to recognize and understand culture inside a client's organization\n\nAnd the power of making simple, true frameworks with clients\n\n### 4\\. Yes! And...\n\n*Thinking on your feet & being able to spar with clients is a crucial consulting skill. This series takes inspiration from the book Impro by Keith Johnstone to examine consulting through the lens of improv theatre.*\n\nHow to think on your feet without bullshitting.\n\nIf you walk in the door with a problems-focused mindset ready to criticize the client you’ll get rejected by the organization like a bad virus.\n\nGenerating & Co-Creating Strategy in the Theatre of Work\n\nHow to get things done inside organizations by understanding power potholes and status switching\n\nEmbracing the fool & the power of not fitting in\n\n### 5\\. Chronos & Kairos\n\n*A crucial mistake many consultants make is to act like an employee. Instead consultants should seek to play games employees can't play. Notably time management and just-in-time work open up possibilities.*\n\nMastering Chronos & Kairos to deliver just-in-time consulting\n\nPutting together an independent life without falling apart\n\n### 6\\. The Inner Life of Consultants\n\n*Being independent comes with the burden of managing your own identity and your own career. How do you create narrative structures and self-reflection to avoid going crazy.*\n\nThe struggle to define who you are as an independent and the promise of charging more for your work\n\nCompound Narrative (draft)\n\nHow to create a narrative arc through your career as an independent\n","n":0.045}}},{"i":509,"$":{"0":{"v":"The NoSurf Activities List","n":0.5},"1":{"v":"\n[The NoSurf Activities List](https://nosurf.net/activity-list/)\n","n":0.5}}},{"i":510,"$":{"0":{"v":"The neuroscience of ikigai","n":0.5},"1":{"v":"\n- Author: [[resources.people.Anne-Laure Le Cunff]]\n- `url:` https://nesslabs.com/ikigai-neuroscience\n- Status: read on 10/18/2021\n","n":0.302}}},{"i":511,"$":{"0":{"v":"The History of Lorem Ipsum   Priceonomics","n":0.408},"1":{"v":"\n# [The History of Lorem Ipsum - Priceonomics](https://priceonomics.com/the-history-of-lorem-ipsum/)\n\n[![text](inbox/assets/text..png?strip=all&lossy=1&w=640&ssl=1)![text](inbox/assets/text..png?strip=all&lossy=1&w=640&ssl=1)](https://bootswatch.com/cosmo/)\n\n> *Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet…*\n\nIf you’re a designer, this phrase is everywhere. Known as “filler text” or “Greek copy”, people use it to simulate the appearance of whatever text will ultimately be used in a design. This way, a designer doesn’t have to wait for the text to be written to format it, and they and the client aren’t distracted from the graphical or interactive elements of the design by reading the copy. Because nobody would mistake it for their native language, Lorem Ipsum is also less likely than other filler text to be mistaken for final copy and [published by accident.](http://loremoopsum.tumblr.com/)\n\nIts use is somewhat [controversial](http://karenmcgrane.com/2010/01/10/in-defense-of-lorem-ipsum/) but widespread. You can use a generator to get paragraphs of this stuff, or simply copy a paragraph from [somebody else’s web page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorem_ipsum), and loop it:\n\n> *Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat. Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur.

The words are a reasonable length, individual characters are used with about the right frequency. That actually isn’t a very easy thing to just pull out of thin air. And creating a standardized, professionally accepted written gibberish is even harder, which is why Lorem Ipsum is such a godsend for designers. Yes, you can hand your client a design for their very serious website with [Hipster Ipsum](http://hipsum.co/?paras=4&type=hipster-centric) as filler text, but they might not be too happy about it.\n\nWhat is this incantation we wrap every prototype we make in, before filling it with the text we hope will make it great? It turns out that Lorem Ipsum is such a good tool in these ways because its half invented and half discovered. It *does* actually mean something. Here’s how it got from the pen of a Roman philosopher to your browser window, and how a medieval typesetter might have scrambled it on the way.\n\n**All Latin to Me**\n\n![a bottle of wine](inbox/assets/a%20bottle%20of%20wine..jpg?strip=all&lossy=1&w=640&ssl=1)![a bottle of wine](inbox/assets/a%20bottle%20of%20wine..jpg?strip=all&lossy=1&w=640&ssl=1)\n\n> [*Lorem Ipsum on a wine bottle.*](https://www.flickr.com/photos/cassidy/6416510723/in/photolist-aM1i6e-5iDmmh-6bxtvM-zuJzg-4vusov-7CXfsk-PFZKL-9eW1Zz-5ndtFT-4pkJx6-9oiL9F-5xe2Jg-qQ7TKh-os86Es-a2JG4j-a2JFZS-DGdQP-qSpRh4-2uBJYJ-dxrQCN-84RQRG-6R8cbQ-rdC49X-qgB3KS-rdvYUU-rbjDXJ-qW3WYs-qzXvqc-qSfC5r-8vmjf5-nQJpk-JA7kd-4w7H5V-9V8M7M-qWbZTM-6MEAsh-7VXeHE-6DJF4D-dxmp9p-a2y7xp-5uzo72-8H8Dcn-5b6kJq-4w7Hpi-dxmpdT-BV2vz-PZrEq-dxrQAQ-7djwH7-dxmpbv)\n\nThe Roman empire had the technology of written language, and a lot of their records, written in Latin, survive today. Unfortunately those records are shrouded in many dense layers of propaganda: they’ve been selectively preserved and presented by academics over the millennia, to support whatever political, religious, or philosophical cause; and of course, many of them were spun to the political needs of the Romans who wrote them in the first place. As a consequence, most ancient history should should be taken with several grains of salt.\n\nIn any case, the official history is as follows: In the first Century BC, there was a man named Marcus Tullius Cicero. He was a lawyer, statesman, and philosopher, and he was very good at oratory. In fact he might have been the best orator who has ever lived, and the most influential. Julius Caesar himself [hailed him as a cultural titan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cicero#cite_note-66): “It is more important to have greatly extended the frontiers of the Roman spirit than the frontiers of the Roman empire.”\n\nAmong his works was the *De Finibus Bonorum et Malorum (“On the Extremes of Good and Evil”)*, which includes an excerpt believed to be the source for Lorem Ipsum. He wrote it in 45 BC:\n\n> *Neque porro quisquam est, qui* ***dolorem ipsum*** *quia dolor sit amet, consectetur, adipisci velit, sed quia non numquam eius modi tempora incidunt ut labore et dolore magnam aliquam quaerat voluptatem.*\n\nWhich [translates to](http://www.lipsum.com/):\n\n> *Nor is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure.*\n\nMany more words and fragments of the longer multi-paragraph form of Lorem Ipsum can also be found in this passage of *De Finibus.* The passage, in its entirety, relates to hedonism, and how sometimes we do unpleasant things to reach pleasurable goals, and sometimes indulgence in pleasure can incur painful consequences. The passage concludes, “The wise man therefore always holds in these matters to this principle of selection: he rejects pleasures to secure other greater pleasures, or else he endures pains to avoid worse pains.”\n\nCicero also was a supporter of the Republic, and opposed Julius Caesar and the subsequent empire. Cicero’s politics and influence eventually earned him the title of “enemy of the state,” and bought him a beheading. After cutting of his head, his executioners cut his eloquent hands off too, and it is said his tongue was also cut out and stabbed several times with a hairpin.\n\n**Scrambling Cicero**\n\n![a hand with a message](inbox/assets/a%20hand%20with%20a%20message..jpg?strip=all&lossy=1&w=640&ssl=1)![a hand with a message](inbox/assets/a%20hand%20with%20a%20message..jpg?strip=all&lossy=1&w=640&ssl=1)\n\n> *[A lorem ipsum tattoo](http://27.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lma95snkMq1qjm0mao1_500.jpg)*\n\nDespite these precautions, Cicero remained influential, even in death. Even emperors continued to read his works and respect his craft. A few hundred years after his death, Emperor Constantine converted to Christianity, and Latin became the official language of what was to become the Catholic church, which exerted a lot of influence Europe for the remainder of the millennium. The Latin language survived as a lingua franca across Europe, especially among the literate classes, and, when the printing press was invented, Latin texts were among the first things published — [starting, of course, with the Bible](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gutenberg_Bible). Cicero’s works followed soon after, because the church had declared him a “righteous Pagan,” and had preserved and promoted much of his work — from books to speeches to letters.\n\nAccording to [*Merriam-Webster’s Encyclopedia of Literature*](http://books.google.com/books?id=eKNK1YwHcQ4C&pg=PA244#v=onepage&q&f=false), “Cicero’s influence on Latin prose was so great that subsequent prose — not only in Latin but in later vernacular languages up to the 19th century — was either a reaction against or a return to his style.” If you found Cicero’s advice to “reject pleasures to secure other greater pleasures; endure pains to avoid worse pains” is so obvious that it’s not even worth saying, it might be because the way you think is ultimately grounded in Ciceronian ethics.\n\nThe point is, for a long time, Cicero was *everywhere.*\n\nAnd this, Latin professor [Richard McClintock](http://nwalsh.com/comp.fonts/FAQ/cf_36.htm) says, is a big factor in how Lorem Ipsum must have become filler text. McClintock is credited with tracking down the original excerpt from *De Finibus* and identifying it with Lorem Ipsum. This is how he thinks it was transformed:\n\nAt some point, likely in the middle ages, a typesetter had to make a type specimen book, to demo different fonts, and he got the idea that if the text should be insensible, so as not to distract from the page’s graphical features. So he took a handy page of non-Biblical Latin — Cicero — and scrambled it into mostly gibberish. “Lorem” isn’t even a Latin word — it’s the second half of “dolorem,” meaning “pain” or “sorrow”. Thus Lorem Ipsum was born, and began its long journey to ubiquity.\n\n[*The Guardian*](http://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2014/mar/21/lorem-ipsum-translated-latin-placeholder-text) quoted a Latin scholar on just what the scrambled Cicero “means” to someone who understands Latin. This is what he came up with:\n\n> *Rrow itself, let it be sorrow; let him love it; let him pursue it, ishing for its acquisitiendum. Because he will ab hold, unless but through concer, and also of those who resist. Now a pure snore disturbeded sum dust. He ejjnoyes, in order that somewon, also with a severe one, unless of life.*\n\n**The Commodification and Standardization of Scrambled Cicero**\n\n![a close-up of a card](inbox/assets/a%20close-up%20of%20a%20card..jpg?strip=all&lossy=1&w=640&ssl=1)![a close-up of a card](inbox/assets/a%20close-up%20of%20a%20card..jpg?strip=all&lossy=1&w=640&ssl=1)\n\n> *This is [how fonts used to work](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letraset#/media/File:Letraset-boegen.JPG) for graphic designers*\n\nThere were probably then, and still are, many options that designers can turn to for filler text. But in the 20th Century, Lorem Ipsum took over as the industry standard.\n\nBack in the 1960s, if you were prototyping an advertisement and wanted to include machine-lettered text, you usually didn’t *type* it unless you wanted the very specific font and gauge of your typewriter. One thing you could do was take a transfer sheet, which you could use to basically iron-on the fonts you wanted where you wanted them. A company called Letraset made these sheets, and included paragraphs and paragraphs of Lorem Ipsum among its offerings — in various fonts, sizes, and formats.\n\nThe introduction of the personal computer made graphic design a lot less painful. One of the earliest pieces of software for publishing and layout was PageMaker 1.0 from the Aldus Corporation in 1985. One of the features they included, from the get-go, was Lorem Ipsum. The rest is history.\n\n![chart, histogram](inbox/assets/chart,%20histogram..png?strip=all&lossy=1&w=640&ssl=1)![chart, histogram](inbox/assets/chart,%20histogram..png?strip=all&lossy=1&w=640&ssl=1)\n\n> *The percentage of bigrams in Google’s English books corpus that are “lorem ipsum”, by year. Source: [Google n-grams](https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=lorem+ipsum&year_start=1800&year_end=2000&corpus=15&smoothing=3&share=&direct_url=t1%3B%2Clorem%20ipsum%3B%2Cc0)*[  \n> ](https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=lorem+ipsum&year_start=1800&year_end=2000&corpus=15&smoothing=3&share=&direct_url=t1%3B%2Clorem%20ipsum%3B%2Cc0)\n\nLorem Ipsum’s connection to Cicero was seemingly forgotten until McClintock — who noticed that the word “consectetur” was real Latin, but also a relatively infrequently used word — dug up the source. “It’s not Latin, though it looks like it, and it actually says nothing,” the editors of a publishing magazine, [*Before & After*, wrote in the 1990s](http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/2290/what-does-the-filler-text-lorem-ipsum-mean). “Its ‘words’ loosely approximate the frequency with which letters occur in English, which is why at a glance it looks pretty real.” McClintock wrote in with his research and the magazine issued a correction.\n\nEven though Lorem Ipsum proliferated in the hands of people who didn’t know its history, and many who didn’t care to, Cicero remains as relevant as ever. Any designer — web, graphic, ux — who has stayed up late at night, designing around filler text, has been blearily blinking for hours at an encoded piece wisdom from a great man: The wise man should not suffer for the sake of suffering, but, occasionally, toil and pain can procure great pleasure.

There are a number of subjects that need to be covered in order to ensure you are ready for back-to-back questions.\n\nSome positions require [Hadoop](https://hadoop.apache.org/), others [SQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL). Some roles require understanding statistics, while still others require heavy amounts of system design.\n\nWe have gathered many of the resources that we have used to study and get jobs at companies in the FAANG family as well as other major tech companies. We have yet to find one that requires you to know anything about Hadoop during the interview, so that has not been included in this study guide.\n\nWe recommend asking the recruiter if you aren’t sure which type of interview you will be facing. Some companies are very good at keeping interviews consistent, but even then, teams can deviate depending on what they are looking for. Here are some examples of what we have noticed about some companies' data engineering interviews.\n\n**Amazon —** SQL- and database-design heavy as well as general ETL design. Surprisingly, no Python.\n\n**Netflix —**SQL- and code-heavy, with the expectation that you can not only write SQL and code but can optimize them.\n\n> _“They asked about SQL queries to find time difference between two events given certain condition. ” — Netflix data engineer on Glassdoor_\n\n**Expedia** — Big Data questions, like what is Spark and RDDs, as well as SQL and Python.\n\nDue to this variance, we’ve created a checklist to keep track of what subject areas you have already studied and what you still need to cover: [data engineering study checklist](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GOO4s1NcxCR8a44F0XnsErz5rYDxNbHAHznu4pJMRkw/edit#gid=0).\n\nAlso, I recently created a [video guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lloOlnSzSs&t=1s) to walk through the data engineering interview study guide.\n\nLet’s get started with SQL.\n\nSQL\n===\n\nAs a data engineer, it is almost inevitable that you will get some SQL questions. As someone who has participated in many interviews for a lot of top tech companies, like Amazon and Capital One, I know that they usually follow some similar patterns.\n\nTypically there will be at least one question that requires an aggregation with a filter, another that requires a few joins, and then one that requires a subquery. Along with that, there might be a few curveball questions that require self-joins, recursions, and analytic functions. So let’s look at a couple of concepts that are good to cover.\n\nPre-video SQL problems\n----------------------\n\nThese first few problems will help you gauge where you are on different concepts. That way you can take notes on the study guide, and go back and review what you feel you were not comfortable with.\n\n1.  [262\\.

In addition, we have listed a few plausible database/DW concepts you could attempt to design out on your own.\n\nWe recommend going through the videos and at least skimming the Data Warehouse Toolkit before attempting the self-practice problems.\n\n[The Data Warehouse Toolkit](https://www.kimballgroup.com/data-warehouse-business-intelligence-resources/books/data-warehouse-dw-toolkit/)  by Ralph Kimball\n\n[Designing a Traditional Relational Database Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_rxqSJAj6U)\n\n[Data Warehouse Design Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--OJpdPeH80)\n\nSelf-practice problems\n----------------------\n\nFor this part of your interview practice, we are going to list a few business systems that you can try to design out. First, we recommend designing a relational database, then thinking about how you would design an ETL and DW that rely on that relational DB.\n\n**Note:** In addition, we have found it very common that interviewers will base their interview questions on your design. So think about some of the questions you could answer with your DB and list them.\n\nDesign a database/ETL and DW for a:\n\n*   dating app\n*   bicycle rental service\n*   music streaming app\n*   job search website\n*   Udemy-like website\n\nThese are just a few ideas. We hope they help you have a clearer idea of what you can practice modeling and designing. Take some time to think about how users interact with these websites before getting started.\n\nProgramming Problems\n====================\n\nData engineers do a significant amount of programming in their daily life. There are several specific languages data engineers use. Python is arguably the most common.\n\nIf the role requires a lot of Hadoop work, then [Java](https://www.java.com/en/) is also a useful language to have. There are a few other useful languages, like Java and [PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/overview?view=powershell-7.1) (if you work at a Microsoft shop).\n\nThere are two types of questions we have experienced. Some interviewers will ask you more operational questions. Others will ask classic algorithm and data structure questions.\n\nOperational Programming Problems\n================================\n\nOperational interview questions are harder to prep for. There are no “classic” interview questions here. However, they are also often easier to figure out on the spot. Algorithm interview questions usually have some sort of trick. Like the balanced brackets problem: If you don’t know you need to use queues, it will be very difficult to get to the correct answer.\n\nOperational problems, however, will be more focused on workflows and business processes. So as long as you are good at walking through real problems, this should be easier. Here are some problems that are great for prepping. We find it is helpful to know how to use arrays and dictionaries. Beyond that, there isn’t too much more required.\n\n1.

In this case, they added [Spark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Spark). So for those of you out there needing to study for Spark, here is what Paul Russel added to the checklist.

A monologue about suicide, at the porous border between sanity and madness. A girl drowning in a brook, grief-stricken for her father. If David Lynch had made Twin Peaks 400 years ago, he might have come up with something similar. But this was William Shakespeare. In 1596, his son Hamnet died at the age of 11 – and five years later, as the playwright was finishing his tragedy Hamlet, Shakespeare’s father suffered a serious illness. He was to die in September 1601.\n\n“Something must have been at work in Shakespeare, something powerful enough to call forth this linguistic explosion,” [writes Harvard professor Stephen Greenblatt](http://www.nybooks.com/articles/2004/10/21/the-death-of-hamnet-and-the-making-of-hamlet/). “As audiences and readers have long instinctively understood, passionate grief, provoked by the death of a loved one, lies at the heart of Shakespeare’s tragedy.” The death of his son and the impending death of his father “could have caused a psychic disturbance that helps to explain the explosive power and inwardness of Hamlet”. What is revered as one of the greatest works in literature is likely to have sprung from a place of intense emotional suffering.\n\n![Hamlet is a play “about what it is like to live inwardly in the queasy interval between a murderous design and its fulfilment,” writes Greenblatt (Credit: Alamy)](inbox/assets/Hamlet%20is%20a%20play%20“about%20what%20it%20is%20like%20to%20live%20inwardly%20in%20the%20queasy%20interval%20between%20a%20murderous%20design%20and%20its%20fulfilment,”%20writes%20Greenblatt%20(Credit%20Alamy).jpeg)\")\n\nHamlet is a play “about what it is like to live inwardly in the queasy interval between a murderous design and its fulfilment,” writes Greenblatt (Credit: Alamy)\n\nThe crucible in which Hamlet was forged might help explain why the tragedy continues to speak to audiences around the world four centuries on. It came eighth in BBC Culture’s [Stories that Shaped the World poll](http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20180521-the-top-10-stories-that-shaped-the-world), with voters praising its extraordinary insight into human nature. Hamlet is “the play that exemplifies Shakespeare’s profound understanding of the human psyche in so much of its nuanced extremity… our simultaneous blending of genius and self-sabotage, our capacity for love and hate, creativity and destruction,” claims the US poet, novelist and critic Elizabeth Rosner. According to the UK author and critic Adam Thorpe, it’s a story that has “influenced the way we think about our muddled selves. We enter Hamlet’s inner core and emerge rinsed of illusion.” Hamlet reveals how much stories can teach us about ourselves.\n\nAs the philosopher Noam Chomsky has said, “we will always learn more about human life and personality from novels than from scientific psychology” – something the critic and author David Lodge has explored. In his 2004 book [Consciousness and the Novel](http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674013773&content=reviews), Lodge argues that “literature is a record of human consciousness, the richest and most comprehensive we have… The novel is arguably man’s most successful effort to describe the experience of individual human beings moving through space and time.”\n\n![Lodge argues that “The crises are basically the same: we all have the same wishes and the same hopes… in fiction you get models of how other people react” (Credit: Alamy)](https://ychef.files.bbci.co.uk/976x549/p06c4qft.jpg \"Lodge argues that “The crises are basically the same: we all have the same wishes and the same hopes… in fiction you get models of how other people react” (Credit: Alamy)\")\n\nLodge argues that “The crises are basically the same: we all have the same wishes and the same hopes… in fiction you get models of how other people react” (Credit: Alamy)\n\nOn one level, it’s the ability to spy on other people’s thoughts that gives literature this insight. “We do not really know what anybody else is actually thinking at any time – consciousness is a very private thing – and we partly go to literature in its various forms to make up or compensate for the necessary solipsism of our own inner lives,” Lodge tells BBC Culture. “Fundamentally, the reason why we read literary texts is that it gives the impression, if it’s successful, of enabling you to understand how other people think. We know what *we* feel and what *we* think, and what we hope for and fear, but we don’t really know how other people process these feelings and observations.”\n\nAs Greenblatt argues, in Hamlet, Shakespeare “had perfected the means to represent inwardness… coming in the wake of Hamnet’s death, it expressed Shakespeare’s deepest perception of existence, his understanding of what could be said and what should remain unspoken, his preference for things untidy, damaged, and unresolved over things neatly arranged, well made, and settled”.\n\n![According to Greenblatt, Hamlet “must have emerged in an unusually direct way from the playwright’s inner life” (Credit: Alamy)](inbox/assets/According%20to%20Greenblatt,%20Hamlet%20“must%20have%20emerged%20in%20an%20unusually%20direct%20way%20from%20the%20playwright’s%20inner%20life”%20(Credit%20Alamy).jpeg)\")\n\nAccording to Greenblatt, Hamlet “must have emerged in an unusually direct way from the playwright’s inner life” (Credit: Alamy)\n\nThe critic Harold Bloom has gone so far as to claim that “Shakespeare will go on explaining us, in part because he invented us”. The playwright’s characters, Bloom argues in his 1998 book Shakespeare: The Invention of the Human, “are extraordinary instances not only of how meaning gets started, rather than repeated, but also of how new modes of consciousness come into being… no one, before or since Shakespeare, made so many separate selves”. He credits his own passion for books as stemming from the access they give him into the minds of others: “I am naive enough to read incessantly because I cannot, on my own, get to know enough people profoundly enough.”\n\n**Ways of seeing**\n\nThat impulse can go beyond simply understanding who we are: reading can shape our sense of ourselves. “Whether it’s Dante when I turned 60 or Alice in Wonderland when I was an adolescent, these stories were for me autobiographical,” Alberto Manguel, writer and director of the National Library of Argentina, tells BBC Culture. “I understood perfectly what Alice felt in the world of absurd adults, where she tries as politely as she can to ask intelligent questions, when everything around her seems absurd. That helped me understand the mad world I was in – and later, when I discovered the political world and the Mad Hatter says there is no room at the table, and Alice points out that the table is set for many people and there is lots of room, I felt that was exactly what I was seeing in society, where a group of people like the Mad Hatter were saying to others who were starving that there’s no room at the table.”\n\n![“Words reveal to Alice that the only indisputable fact of this bewildering world is that under an apparent rationalism we are all mad,” writes Alberto Manguel (Credit: Alamy)](inbox/assets/“Words%20reveal%20to%20Alice%20that%20the%20only%20indisputable%20fact%20of%20this%20bewildering%20world%20is%20that%20under%20an%20apparent%20rationalism%20we%20are%20all%20mad,”%20writes%20Alberto%20Manguel%20(Credit%20Alamy).jpeg)\")\n\n“Words reveal to Alice that the only indisputable fact of this bewildering world is that under an apparent rationalism we are all mad,” writes Alberto Manguel (Credit: Alamy)\n\nHe insists that reading has given meaning to his life experiences. “I’m certain that if I hadn’t read Alice in Wonderland and Dante, I wouldn’t understand so many aspects of myself.” In his book [Curiosity](https://yalebooks.yale.edu/book/9780300219807/curiosity), Manguel claims he might not be able to identify himself in a police line-up: “I’m not sure whether this is because my features age too rapidly and too drastically or because my own self is less grounded in my memory than the printed words I’ve learned by heart.”\n\nIdentification with a story can come in unexpected ways. Preti Taneja’s debut novel We That Are Young reimagines King Lear in modern-day Delhi. Studying the play at school in the UK, she felt a profound connection – one that surprised her. “In King Lear I recognised the Indian extended family I was used to visiting in Delhi each summer,” [she has written](https://www.cam.ac.uk/research/discussion/looking-for-king-lear-in-kashmir). “Shakespeare somehow recognised the part of my life my English friends had no idea about – the Indian part, in India.”\n\nKing Lear helped her to think about the Partition of India. “No one talked about it at school, yet there was this definite sense that there was a huge story that had brought us to this country, that was the reason I’d been born here – and then suddenly there it was, in Shakespeare of all things,” Taneja tells BBC Culture. “This story of partition that leads to civil war, this story of daughters who are forced into performing well for family honour and duty – which is the situation many second-generation immigrant women face.”\n\n![“Literature can make us think about how patterns are repeated… generational damage is something that we have to work so hard to reverse,” says Taneja (Credit: Alamy)](inbox/assets/“Literature%20can%20make%20us%20think%20about%20how%20patterns%20are%20repeated…%20generational%20damage%20is%20something%20that%20we%20have%20to%20work%20so%20hard%20to%20reverse,”%20says%20Taneja%20(Credit%20Alamy).jpeg)\")\n\n“Literature can make us think about how patterns are repeated… generational damage is something that we have to work so hard to reverse,” says Taneja (Credit: Alamy)\n\nBy turning king into beggar, obedient daughters into villains, loyal daughter into banished exile, legitimate son into outcast and illegitimate son into insider, King Lear messes with ideas of fixed identities. “There’s an aspect in which almost every character is cast into a position of otherness to themselves,” says Taneja. “Everyone gets swapped around. This play really is about alienation from the self, and exploration of the other within the self – how we reconcile those two sides, and come to terms with the fact that we’re all hybrid beings, and that society isn’t a fixed thing.”\n\nBloom touched on this [when he said that](https://prelectur.stanford.edu/lecturers/bloom/interviews.html) “Shakespeare will not make us better and will not make us worse, but he may allow us to overhear ourselves when we talk to ourselves… he may teach us how to accept change in ourselves as in others, and perhaps even the final form of change.” With characters who gauge what they seem like from others’ perspectives, and then adapt their behaviour accordingly, he believes the plays reveal the process of self-revision – the ability “to change by self-overhearing and then by the will to change”.\n\n**A light in the dark**\n\nBut as well as identifying with characters, we read to find out how people profoundly different from us think. “The canon I was introduced to at school included Philip Larkin, JM Coetzee – all these men writing about masculinity and writing about society with a very particular gaze,” says Taneja. “It felt to me like what I was learning was how I was seen. This is what the male characters they are voicing think of me, and of the world of others that I belong to. There were lots of epiphanies in that – Coetzee is one of my favourite writers because his work is so sharp – it taught me about the way that a certain kind of patriarchal masculinity sees me in the world.”\n\n![According to Manguel, “the quest to find out who we are… is responsible, in some measure, for our delight in the stories of others” (Credit: Alamy)](inbox/assets/According%20to%20Manguel,%20“the%20quest%20to%20find%20out%20who%20we%20are…%20is%20responsible,%20in%20some%20measure,%20for%20our%20delight%20in%20the%20stories%20of%20others”%20(Credit%20Alamy).jpeg)\")\n\nAccording to Manguel, “the quest to find out who we are… is responsible, in some measure, for our delight in the stories of others” (Credit: Alamy)\n\nStorytelling [has an evolutionary role in fostering empathy](http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20180503-our-fiction-addiction-why-humans-need-stories). As Atticus Finch said in To Kill a Mockingbird, “You never really understand a person until you consider things from his point of view – until you climb into his skin and walk around in it.” Reading encourages us not to reduce others to caricatures. “Unconsciously we begin to accept that the other is always a mystery and that easy characterisations lead nowhere,” [says the Greek writer Amanda Michalopoulou](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/dec/02/literature-teaches-us-to-understand-the-other). “Literature transforms amorphous fear and pity into individualities. It tells us: the other is not what it seems.”\n\nFiction can place us in uncomfortable positions too. At [BBC Culture’s Stories that Shaped the World event](http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20180622-why-dystopian-fiction-is-an-instruction-manual-for-now), the author Colm Tóibín argued that it should “show you evil so that you would know it”. In the case of Clytemnestra in the Oresteia, he said: “I need to show you someone who was once good… how easily she could become corrupted, what a monster she could become – where you’re almost following her when she comes to murder her husband Agamemnon, thinking ‘I want you to do this’ – you’re pushing the reader’s imagination into areas where the reader might not want to go.”\n\nAnd just as stories demonstrate that humans are neither straightforwardly ‘good’ nor ‘evil’, they also remind us how quickly we change. “Our readings are never absolutes: literature disallows dogmatic tendencies,” writes Manguel. “Instead, we shift allegiances… if we recognise ourselves in Cordelia today, we may call Goneril our sister tomorrow, and end up, in days to come, kindred spirits with Lear, a foolish, fond old man. This transmigration of souls is literature’s modest miracle.”\n\nPerhaps most importantly, reading can reaffirm a feeling we all have – that who we are as humans varies from moment to moment. In response to the question posed by the Caterpillar – “Who are *you*?” – Alice says: “I-I hardly know, Sir, just at present. At least I know who I *was* when I got up this morning, but I think I must have changed several times since then.”\n\n*If you would like to comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Culture, head over to our* [***Facebook***](https://www.facebook.com/pages/BBC-Culture/237388053065908) *page or message us on* [***Twitter***](https://twitter.com/bbc_culture)*.*\n\n*And if you liked this story,* [**sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter**](http://pages.emails.bbc.com/subscribe/)*, called “If You Only Read 6 Things This Week”.

You'll need these soon.\n-   Click **Edit Settings**.\n-   Add `http://localhost:3000` as a redirect URI.\n\nAll done! You now have a properly configured Spotify application and the correct credentials to make requests.\n\n2\n\n### Authentication\n\nThere are a variety of ways to authenticate with the Spotify API, depending on your application. Since we only need permission granted *once*, we'll use the [Authorization Code Flow](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/authorization-guide/#authorization-code-flow).\n\nFirst, we'll have our application request authorization by logging in with whatever [scopes](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/authorization-guide/#list-of-scopes) we need. Here's an example of what the URL might look like. Swap out the `client_id` and scopes for your own.\n\n```\nhttps://accounts.spotify.com/authorize?client_id=8e94bde7dd\nb84a1f7a0e51bf3bc95be8&response_type=code&redirect_uri=http\n%3A%2F%2Flocalhost:3000&scope=user-read-currently-playing%20\nuser-top-read\n```\n\nAfter authorizing, you'll be redirected back to your `redirect_uri`. In the URL, there's a `code` query parameter. Save this value.\n\n```\nhttp://localhost:3000/callback?code=NApCCg..BkWtQ\n```\n\nNext, we'll need to retrieve the refresh token. You'll need to generate a Base 64 encoded string containing the client ID and secret from earlier. You can use [this tool](https://www.base64encode.org/) to encode it online. The format should be `client_id:client_secret`.\n\n```\ncurl -H \"Authorization: Basic <base64 encoded client_id:client_secret>\"\n-d grant_type=authorization_code -d code=<code> -d redirect_uri=http%3A\n%2F%2Flocalhost:3000 https://accounts.spotify.com/api/token\n```\n\nThis will return a JSON response containing a `refresh_token`. This token is [valid indefinitely](https://github.com/spotify/web-api/issues/374) unless you revoke access, so we'll want to save this in an environment variable.\n\n3\n\n### Add Environment Variables\n\nTo securely access the API, we need to include the secret with each request. We also *do not* want to commit secrets to git. Thus, we should use an environment variable. Learn how to add [environment variables in Vercel](https://vercel.com/docs/environment-variables).\n","n":0.049}}},{"i":522,"$":{"0":{"v":"Some Plain Text Note Taking Tactics","n":0.408},"1":{"v":"\n- Areas: [[Note Taking]]\n\n---\n\n# [Some Plain Text Note Taking Tactics](https://plaintextproject.online/articles/2021/06/08/tactics.html)\n\nTo be honest, I can't think of anyone who doesn't take notes regularly. That could be for classes or courses they're taking, during meetings, while doing research or interviews, or just collecting information to add to a [digital garden](https://weeklymusings.net/weekly-musings-092).\n\nWhile many people like to go the [analog route](http://www.thecramped.com/) when taking notes, others cut out the middle person and type directly into text editor or note taking tool as they're working or listening. Using plain text for taking notes in those situations is quick. It's efficient. It just makes sense.\n\nIn the next few hundred words, I'd like to share some tactics that can make the process of taking notes with plain text a bit easier, a bit more efficient, and which can help give your notes a bit more structure.\n\n## Choose Your Weapon\n\nI'm not going to tell you what the *best* tool for taking plain text notes is. Why? I don't what's best for your needs.\n\nInstead, use the tool or application that you're most comfortable with. That could be a [text editor](https://plaintextproject.online/2019/06/18/texted.html). It could be a favourite [note taking](https://plaintextproject.online/2018/03/01/standard.html) tool [or the other](https://plaintextproject.online/2019/02/06/joplin.html). Or it could be a wiki or a fancy new tool like Obsidian.\n\nDon't dwell upon or obsess about what you're using. Don't fall into the tool fetishism trap. Make your choice. Use it. If it's not working out, swap your tools out at a later date.\n\n## Naming Files\n\nThink about the function or purpose of the file. Then, use that function or purpose in the name of a file.\n\nWhat do I mean by function or purpose? Let’s say you’re taking notes for a course you're taking. You might decide to have a separate file for each class or lecture. In that case, you can name your files something like this:\n\n`[course-name]-[subject]-[date].txt`\n\nFor example, *Cambodian-History101-Angkorian-Era-2021-06-01.txt*.\n\nIf you're taking notes as part of a large project, include the project’s name (or acronym) in the file name. When, for example, I was taking notes for my book *[HTML for Writers](https://scottnesbitt.gumroad.com/l/learnhtml)*, I used file names like this:\n\n`HTML_Book-ch1.txt`\n\nRegardless of how you name your files, make sure they're easy to identify if you're searching for or scanning for them.\n\n## Structuring Your Files\n\nYou shouldn't worry too much about the structure of your notes at this point. Becoming preoccupied with structure will slow down your note taking flow.\n\nAt the very least, add headings to the file where and when needed. Usually, that's to denote a logical separation of ideas. Don't get too fancy at this point — just have the heading in title case or all capitals on its own line in the file.\n\nYou can also prepare a text file ahead of time by adding some metadata to the top of that file. The metadata helps identify the context of your notes. Here's an example:\n\n```\nINTERVIEW SUBJECT: Someone Interesting\nTOPIC: Background for article on XYZ\nDATE: 17 December, 2021\n```\n\nYou can learn more about that in [a previous article](https://plaintextproject.online/2020/04/14/structure.html#how-to-add-structure)\n\n## Use Point Form\n\nDon't try to take everything down, especially if you're in a lecture or a meeting. If you do, you'll miss more than record. Instead, focus on taking down key points and keywords. Use those points and keywords to jog you memory later, or to give you a base from which to do further research.\n\nThe best way to do that is to write in point form. Use sentence fragments rather than full sentences. Again, when you go back to your notes later, you can flesh out those sentence fragments. Not just expanding them into full sentences, but also adding more information and context.\n\nWhen I take notes, I often use point form literally — every idea or line is a bullet point, denoted by an asterisk or a dash.\n\n## Should You Markup Your?\n\nBy that, I mean adding formatting with a lightweight markup language like [Markdown](https://scottnesbitt.gumroad.com/l/learnmarkdown). I don't think you should, at least not while taking notes. Doing that can can break up your note taking flow.\n\nInstead, add any markup after you finish taking your notes. That can give you time think about what (if anything) needs to be marked up.\n\n## Organizing Your Files\n\nTaking notes is all well and good, but your notes are useless if you can't find them. Organization is the key to effectively using your notes.\n\nFirst off, think about whether you going to keep your notes in one large file or multiple small ones. I discussed the pros and cons of both approaches in [an article](https://plaintextproject.online/2019/10/01/single-multiple.html) from 2019.\n\nNext, think about how you're going to store your notes.

His reaction was unequivocal, \"That is positively the dopiest idea I ever heard.\" For Richard a crazy idea was an opportunity to either prove it wrong or prove it right. Either way, he was interested. By the end of lunch he had agreed to spend the summer working at the company.\n\nRichard's interest in computing went back to his days at Los Alamos, where he supervised the \"computers,\" that is, the people who operated the mechanical calculators. There he was instrumental in setting up some of the first plug-programmable tabulating machines for physical simulation. His interest in the field was heightened in the late 1970's when his son, Carl, began studying computers at MIT.\n\nI got to know Richard through his son. I was a graduate student at the MIT Artificial Intelligence Lab and Carl was one of the undergraduates helping me with my thesis project. I was trying to design a computer fast enough to solve common sense reasoning problems. The machine, as we envisioned it, would contain a million tiny computers, all connected by a communications network. We called it a \"Connection Machine.\" Richard, always interested in his son's activities, followed the project closely. He was skeptical about the idea, but whenever we met at a conference or I visited CalTech, we would stay up until the early hours of the morning discussing details of the planned machine. The first time he ever seemed to believe that we were really going to try to build it was the lunchtime meeting.\n\nRichard arrived in Boston the day after the company was incorporated. We had been busy raising the money, finding a place to rent, issuing stock, etc. We set up in an old mansion just outside of the city, and when Richard showed up we were still recovering from the shock of having the first few million dollars in the bank. No one had thought about anything technical for several months. We were arguing about what the name of the company should be when Richard walked in, saluted, and said, \"Richard Feynman reporting for duty. OK, boss, what's my assignment?\" The assembled group of not-quite-graduated MIT students was astounded.\n\nAfter a hurried private discussion (\"I don't know, you hired him...\"), we informed Richard that his assignment would be to advise on the application of parallel processing to scientific problems.\n\n\"That sounds like a bunch of baloney,\" he said. \"Give me something real to do.\"\n\nSo we sent him out to buy some office supplies. While he was gone, we decided that the part of the machine that we were most worried about was the router that delivered messages from one processor to another. We were not sure that our design was going to work. When Richard returned from buying pencils, we gave him the assignment of analyzing the router.\n\n## The Machine\n\nThe router of the Connection Machine was the part of the hardware that allowed the processors to communicate. It was a complicated device; by comparison, the processors themselves were simple. Connecting a separate communication wire between each pair of processors was impractical since a million processors would require $10^{12\\]$ wires. Instead, we planned to connect the processors in a 20-dimensional hypercube so that each processor would only need to talk to 20 others directly. Because many processors had to communicate simultaneously, many messages would contend for the same wires. The router's job was to find a free path through this 20-dimensional traffic jam or, if it couldn't, to hold onto the message in a buffer until a path became free. Our question to Richard Feynman was whether we had allowed enough buffers for the router to operate efficiently.\n\nDuring those first few months, Richard began studying the router circuit diagrams as if they were objects of nature. He was willing to listen to explanations of how and why things worked, but fundamentally he preferred to figure out everything himself by simulating the action of each of the circuits with pencil and paper.\n\nIn the meantime, the rest of us, happy to have found something to keep Richard occupied, went about the business of ordering the furniture and computers, hiring the first engineers, and arranging for the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) to pay for the development of the first prototype. Richard did a remarkable job of focusing on his \"assignment,\" stopping only occasionally to help wire the computer room, set up the machine shop, shake hands with the investors, install the telephones, and cheerfully remind us of how crazy we all were. When we finally picked the name of the company, Thinking Machines Corporation, Richard was delighted. \"That's good. Now I don't have to explain to people that I work with a bunch of loonies. I can just tell them the name of the company.\"\n\nThe technical side of the project was definitely stretching our capacities. We had decided to simplify things by starting with only 64,000 processors, but even then the amount of work to do was overwhelming. We had to design our own silicon integrated circuits, with processors and a router. We also had to invent packaging and cooling mechanisms, write compilers and assemblers, devise ways of testing processors simultaneously, and so on. Even simple problems like wiring the boards together took on a whole new meaning when working with tens of thousands of processors. In retrospect, if we had had any understanding of how complicated the project was going to be, we never would have started.\n\n## 'Get These Guys Organized'\n\nI had never managed a large group before and I was clearly in over my head. Richard volunteered to help out. \"We've got to get these guys organized,\" he told me. \"Let me tell you how we did it at Los Alamos.\"\n\nEvery great man that I have known has had a certain time and place in their life that they use as a reference point; a time when things worked as they were supposed to and great things were accomplished. For Richard, that time was at Los Alamos during the Manhattan Project. Whenever things got \"cockeyed,\" Richard would look back and try to understand how now was different than then. Using this approach, Richard decided we should pick an expert in each area of importance in the machine, such as software or packaging or electronics, to become the \"group leader\" in this area, analogous to the group leaders at Los Alamos.\n\nPart Two of Feynman's \"Let's Get Organized\" campaign was that we should begin a regular seminar series of invited speakers who might have interesting things to do with our machine. Richard's idea was that we should concentrate on people with new applications, because they would be less conservative about what kind of computer they would use. For our first seminar he invited John Hopfield, a friend of his from CalTech, to give us a talk on his scheme for building neural networks. In 1983, studying neural networks was about as fashionable as studying ESP, so some people considered John Hopfield a little bit crazy. Richard was certain he would fit right in at Thinking Machines Corporation.\n\nWhat Hopfield had invented was a way of constructing an \\[associative memory\\], a device for remembering patterns. To use an associative memory, one trains it on a series of patterns, such as pictures of the letters of the alphabet. Later, when the memory is shown a new pattern it is able to recall a similar pattern that it has seen in the past. A new picture of the letter \"A\" will \"remind\" the memory of another \"A\" that it has seen previously. Hopfield had figured out how such a memory could be built from devices that were similar to biological neurons.\n\nNot only did Hopfield's method seem to work, but it seemed to work well on the Connection Machine. Feynman figured out the details of how to use one processor to simulate each of Hopfield's neurons, with the strength of the connections represented as numbers in the processors' memory. Because of the parallel nature of Hopfield's algorithm, all of the processors could be used concurrently with 100\\\\% efficiency, so the Connection Machine would be hundreds of times faster than any conventional computer.\n\n## An Algorithm For Logarithms\n\nFeynman worked out the program for computing Hopfield's network on the Connection Machine in some detail. The part that he was proudest of was the subroutine for computing logarithms. I mention it here not only because it is a clever algorithm, but also because it is a specific contribution Richard made to the mainstream of computer science. He invented it at Los Alamos.\n\nConsider the problem of finding the logarithm of a fractional number between 1.0 and 2.0 (the algorithm can be generalized without too much difficulty). Feynman observed that any such number can be uniquely represented as a product of numbers of the form $1 + 2^{-k\\]$, where $k$ is an integer. Testing each of these factors in a binary number representation is simply a matter of a shift and a subtraction. Once the factors are determined, the logarithm can be computed by adding together the precomputed logarithms of the factors. The algorithm fit especially well on the Connection Machine, since the small table of the logarithms of $1 + 2^{-k\\]$ could be shared by all the processors. The entire computation took less time than division.\n\nConcentrating on the algorithm for a basic arithmetic operation was typical of Richard's approach. He loved the details. In studying the router, he paid attention to the action of each individual gate and in writing a program he insisted on understanding the implementation of every instruction. He distrusted abstractions that could not be directly related to the facts. When several years later I wrote a general interest article on the Connection Machine for \\[Scientific American\\], he was disappointed that it left out too many details. He asked, \"How is anyone supposed to know that this isn't just a bunch of crap?\"\n\nFeynman's insistence on looking at the details helped us discover the potential of the machine for numerical computing and physical simulation. We had convinced ourselves at the time that the Connection Machine would not be efficient at \"number-crunching,\" because the first prototype had no special hardware for vectors or floating point arithmetic. Both of these were \"known\" to be requirements for number-crunching. Feynman decided to test this assumption on a problem that he was familiar with in detail: quantum chromodynamics.\n\nQuantum chromodynamics is a theory of the internal workings of atomic particles such as protons. Using this theory it is possible, in principle, to compute the values of measurable physical quantities, such as a proton's mass. In practice, such a computation requires so much arithmetic that it could keep the fastest computers in the world busy for years. One way to do this calculation is to use a discrete four-dimensional lattice to model a section of space-time. Finding the solution involves adding up the contributions of all of the possible configurations of certain matrices on the links of the lattice, or at least some large representative sample. (This is essentially a Feynman path integral.) The thing that makes this so difficult is that calculating the contribution of even a single configuration involves multiplying the matrices around every little loop in the lattice, and the number of loops grows as the fourth power of the lattice size. Since all of these multiplications can take place concurrently, there is plenty of opportunity to keep all 64,000 processors busy.\n\nTo find out how well this would work in practice, Feynman had to write a computer program for QCD. Since the only computer language Richard was really familiar with was Basic, he made up a parallel version of Basic in which he wrote the program and then simulated it by hand to estimate how fast it would run on the Connection Machine.\n\nHe was excited by the results. \"Hey Danny, you're not going to believe this, but that machine of yours can actually do something \\[useful\\]!\" According to Feynman's calculations, the Connection Machine, even without any special hardware for floating point arithmetic, would outperform a machine that CalTech was building for doing QCD calculations. From that point on, Richard pushed us more and more toward looking at numerical applications of the machine.\n\nBy the end of that summer of 1983, Richard had completed his analysis of the behavior of the router, and much to our surprise and amusement, he presented his answer in the form of a set of partial differential equations. To a physicist this may seem natural, but to a computer designer, treating a set of boolean circuits as a continuous, differentiable system is a bit strange. Feynman's router equations were in terms of variables representing continuous quantities such as \"the average number of 1 bits in a message address.\" I was much more accustomed to seeing analysis in terms of inductive proof and case analysis than taking the derivative of \"the number of 1's\" with respect to time. Our discrete analysis said we needed seven buffers per chip; Feynman's equations suggested that we only needed five. We decided to play it safe and ignore Feynman.\n\nThe decision to ignore Feynman's analysis was made in September, but by next spring we were up against a wall. The chips that we had designed were slightly too big to manufacture and the only way to solve the problem was to cut the number of buffers per chip back to five. Since Feynman's equations claimed we could do this safely, his unconventional methods of analysis started looking better and better to us. We decided to go ahead and make the chips with the smaller number of buffers.\n\nFortunately, he was right. When we put together the chips the machine worked. The first program run on the machine in April of 1985 was Conway's game of Life.\n\n## Cellular Automata\n\nThe game of Life is an example of a class of computations that interested Feynman called \\[cellular automata\\]. Like many physicists who had spent their lives going to successively lower and lower levels of atomic detail, Feynman often wondered what was at the bottom. One possible answer was a cellular automaton. The notion is that the \"continuum\" might, at its lowest levels, be discrete in both space and time, and that the laws of physics might simply be a macro-consequence of the average behavior of tiny cells. Each cell could be a simple automaton that obeys a small set of rules and communicates only with its nearest neighbors, like the lattice calculation for QCD. If the universe in fact worked this way, then it presumably would have testable consequences, such as an upper limit on the density of information per cubic meter of space.\n\nThe notion of cellular automata goes back to von Neumann and Ulam, whom Feynman had known at Los Alamos. Richard's recent interest in the subject was motivated by his friends Ed Fredkin and Stephen Wolfram, both of whom were fascinated by cellular automata models of physics. Feynman was always quick to point out to them that he considered their specific models \"kooky,\" but like the Connection Machine, he considered the subject sufficiently crazy to put some energy into.\n\nThere are many potential problems with cellular automata as a model of physical space and time; for example, finding a set of rules that obeys special relativity. One of the simplest problems is just making the physics so that things look the same in every direction. The most obvious pattern of cellular automata, such as a fixed three-dimensional grid, have preferred directions along the axes of the grid. Is it possible to implement even Newtonian physics on a fixed lattice of automata?\n\nFeynman had a proposed solution to the anisotropy problem which he attempted (without success) to work out in detail. His notion was that the underlying automata, rather than being connected in a regular lattice like a grid or a pattern of hexagons, might be randomly connected. Waves propagating through this medium would, on the average, propagate at the same rate in every direction.\n\nCellular automata started getting attention at Thinking Machines when Stephen Wolfram, who was also spending time at the company, suggested that we should use such automata not as a model of physics, but as a practical method of simulating physical systems. Specifically, we could use one processor to simulate each cell and rules that were chosen to model something useful, like fluid dynamics. For two-dimensional problems there was a neat solution to the anisotropy problem since \\[Frisch, Hasslacher, Pomeau\\] had shown that a hexagonal lattice with a simple set of rules produced isotropic behavior at the macro scale. Wolfram used this method on the Connection Machine to produce a beautiful movie of a turbulent fluid flow in two dimensions. Watching the movie got all of us, especially Feynman, excited about physical simulation. We all started planning additions to the hardware, such as support of floating point arithmetic that would make it possible for us to perform and display a variety of simulations in real time.\n\n## Feynman the Explainer\n\nIn the meantime, we were having a lot of trouble explaining to people what we were doing with cellular automata. Eyes tended to glaze over when we started talking about state transition diagrams and finite state machines. Finally Feynman told us to explain it like this,\n\n\"We have noticed in nature that the behavior of a fluid depends very little on the nature of the individual particles in that fluid. For example, the flow of sand is very similar to the flow of water or the flow of a pile of ball bearings. We have therefore taken advantage of this fact to invent a type of imaginary particle that is especially simple for us to simulate. This particle is a perfect ball bearing that can move at a single speed in one of six directions. The flow of these particles on a large enough scale is very similar to the flow of natural fluids.\"\n\nThis was a typical Richard Feynman explanation. On the one hand, it infuriated the experts who had worked on the problem because it neglected to even mention all of the clever problems that they had solved. On the other hand, it delighted the listeners since they could walk away from it with a real understanding of the phenomenon and how it was connected to physical reality.\n\nWe tried to take advantage of Richard's talent for clarity by getting him to critique the technical presentations that we made in our product introductions. Before the commercial announcement of the Connection Machine CM-1 and all of our future products, Richard would give a sentence-by-sentence critique of the planned presentation. \"Don't say \\`reflected acoustic wave.' Say \\[echo\\].\" Or, \"Forget all that \\`local minima' stuff. Just say there's a bubble caught in the crystal and you have to shake it out.\" Nothing made him angrier than making something simple sound complicated.\n\nGetting Richard to give advice like that was sometimes tricky. He pretended not to like working on any problem that was outside his claimed area of expertise. Often, at Thinking Machines when he was asked for advice he would gruffly refuse with \"That's not my department.\" I could never figure out just what his department was, but it did not matter anyway, since he spent most of his time working on those \"not-my-department\" problems. Sometimes he really would give up, but more often than not he would come back a few days after his refusal and remark, \"I've been thinking about what you asked the other day and it seems to me...\" This worked best if you were careful not to expect it.\n\nI do not mean to imply that Richard was hesitant to do the \"dirty work.\" In fact, he was always volunteering for it. Many a visitor at Thinking Machines was shocked to see that we had a Nobel Laureate soldering circuit boards or painting walls. But what Richard hated, or at least pretended to hate, was being asked to give advice. So why were people always asking him for it? Because even when Richard didn't understand, he always seemed to understand better than the rest of us. And whatever he understood, he could make others understand as well. Richard made people feel like a child does, when a grown-up first treats him as an adult. He was never afraid of telling the truth, and however foolish your question was, he never made you feel like a fool.\n\nThe charming side of Richard helped people forgive him for his uncharming characteristics. For example, in many ways Richard was a sexist. Whenever it came time for his daily bowl of soup he would look around for the nearest \"girl\" and ask if she would fetch it to him. It did not matter if she was the cook, an engineer, or the president of the company. I once asked a female engineer who had just been a victim of this if it bothered her. \"Yes, it really annoys me,\" she said. \"On the other hand, he is the only one who ever explained quantum mechanics to me as if I could understand it.\" That was the essence of Richard's charm.\n\n## A Kind Of Game\n\nRichard worked at the company on and off for the next five years. Floating point hardware was eventually added to the machine, and as the machine and its successors went into commercial production, they were being used more and more for the kind of numerical simulation problems that Richard had pioneered with his QCD program. Richard's interest shifted from the construction of the machine to its applications. As it turned out, building a big computer is a good excuse to talk to people who are working on some of the most exciting problems in science. We started working with physicists, astronomers, geologists, biologists, chemists --- everyone of them trying to solve some problem that it had never been possible to solve before. Figuring out how to do these calculations on a parallel machine requires understanding of the details of the application, which was exactly the kind of thing that Richard loved to do.\n\nFor Richard, figuring out these problems was a kind of a game. He always started by asking very basic questions like, \"What is the simplest example?\" or \"How can you tell if the answer is right?\" He asked questions until he reduced the problem to some essential puzzle that he thought he would be able to solve. Then he would set to work, scribbling on a pad of paper and staring at the results. While he was in the middle of this kind of puzzle solving he was impossible to interrupt. \"Don't bug me. I'm busy,\" he would say without even looking up. Eventually he would either decide the problem was too hard (in which case he lost interest), or he would find a solution (in which case he spent the next day or two explaining it to anyone who listened). In this way he worked on problems in database searches, geophysical modeling, protein folding, analyzing images, and reading insurance forms.\n\nThe last project that I worked on with Richard was in simulated evolution. I had written a program that simulated the evolution of populations of sexually reproducing creatures over hundreds of thousands of generations. The results were surprising in that the fitness of the population made progress in sudden leaps rather than by the expected steady improvement. The fossil record shows some evidence that real biological evolution might also exhibit such \"punctuated equilibrium,\" so Richard and I decided to look more closely at why it happened. He was feeling ill by that time, so I went out and spent the week with him in Pasadena, and we worked out a model of evolution of finite populations based on the Fokker Planck equations. When I got back to Boston I went to the library and discovered a book by Kimura on the subject, and much to my disappointment, all of our \"discoveries\" were covered in the first few pages. When I called back and told Richard what I had found, he was elated. \"Hey, we got it right!\" he said. \"Not bad for amateurs.\"\n\nIn retrospect I realize that in almost everything that we worked on together, we were both amateurs. In digital physics, neural networks, even parallel computing, we never really knew what we were doing. But the things that we studied were so new that no one else knew exactly what they were doing either. It was amateurs who made the progress.\n\n## Telling The Good Stuff You Know\n\nActually, I doubt that it was \"progress\" that most interested Richard. He was always searching for patterns, for connections, for a new way of looking at something, but I suspect his motivation was not so much to understand the world as it was to find new ideas to explain. The act of discovery was not complete for him until he had taught it to someone else.\n\nI remember a conversation we had a year or so before his death, walking in the hills above Pasadena. We were exploring an unfamiliar trail and Richard, recovering from a major operation for the cancer, was walking more slowly than usual. He was telling a long and funny story about how he had been reading up on his disease and surprising his doctors by predicting their diagnosis and his chances of survival. I was hearing for the first time how far his cancer had progressed, so the jokes did not seem so funny. He must have noticed my mood, because he suddenly stopped the story and asked, \"Hey, what's the matter?\"\n\nI hesitated. \"I'm sad because you're going to die.\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" he sighed, \"that bugs me sometimes too. But not so much as you think.\" And after a few more steps, \"When you get as old as I am, you start to realize that you've told most of the good stuff you know to other people anyway.\"\n\nWe walked along in silence for a few minutes. Then we came to a place where another trail crossed and Richard stopped to look around at the surroundings. Suddenly a grin lit up his face. \"Hey,\" he said, all trace of sadness forgotten, \"I bet I can show you a better way home.\"\n\nAnd so he did.\n","n":0.015}}},{"i":530,"$":{"0":{"v":"Reversible Inhibition of Sperm under Guidance   Wikipedia","n":0.378},"1":{"v":"\n# [Reversible inhibition of sperm under guidance - Wikipedia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reversible_inhibition_of_sperm_under_guidance)\n\n**Reversible inhibition of sperm under guidance** (**RISUG**), formerly referred to as the synthetic [polymer](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymer \"Polymer\") [styrene maleic anhydride](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Styrene_maleic_anhydride \"Styrene maleic anhydride\") (**SMA**), is the development name of a [male contraceptive](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male_contraceptive \"Male contraceptive\") injection developed at [IIT Kharagpur](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Institute_of_Technology_Kharagpur \"Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur\") in [India](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/India \"India\") by the team of Dr. [Sujoy K.

Guha](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sujoy_K._Guha \"Sujoy K. Guha\") developed RISUG after years of developing other inventions. He originally wanted to create an artificial heart that could pump blood using a strong electrical pulse. Using the 13-chamber model of a cockroach heart, he designed a softer pumping mechanism that would theoretically be safe to use in humans.[\\[4\\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-4) As India's population grew throughout the 1970s, Guha modified his heart pump design to create a water pump that could work off of differences in ionic charges between salt water and fresh water in water treatment facilities. This filtration system did not require electricity and could potentially help large groups of people have access to clean water. India, however, decided that the population problem would be better served by developing more effective contraception. So Guha again modified his design to work safely inside the body, specifically inside the male genitalia. The non-toxic polymer of RISUG also uses differences in the charges of the [semen](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semen \"Semen\") to rupture the [sperm](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sperm \"Sperm\") as it flows through the [vas deferens](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vas_deferens \"Vas deferens\").[\\[2\\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-Wired-2)\n\n[Intellectual property](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellectual_property \"Intellectual property\") rights to RISUG in the United States were acquired between 2010 and 2012 by the [Parsemus Foundation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsemus_Foundation \"Parsemus Foundation\"), a [not-for-profit organization](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonprofit_organization \"Nonprofit organization\"), which has branded it as \"Vasalgel\".[\\[5\\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-Beck_2011-06-14-5)[\\[6\\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-6) Vasalgel, which has a slightly different formulation than RISUG, underwent [animal trials](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_testing \"Animal testing\") in the United States, but reversibility proved unsuccessful.[\\[7\\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-Francis-7) Initially, researchers were optimistic that human trials would commence by the end of 2013 and become available within a few years.[\\[8\\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-8) After delays in development, human trials were expected to commence in 2018.[\\[9\\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-9)\n\n## Mechanisms[Edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Reversible_inhibition_of_sperm_under_guidance&action=edit&section=2 \"Edit section: Mechanisms\")\n\nRISUG works by an injection into the vas deferens, the vessel through which the sperm moves before [ejaculation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ejaculation \"Ejaculation\"). RISUG is similar to [vasectomy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasectomy \"Vasectomy\") in that a local anesthetic is administered, an incision is made in the [scrotum](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrotum \"Scrotum\"), and the vasa deferentia are injected with a polymer gel (rather than being cut and cauterized).[\\[10\\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-PPAA-10) In a matter of minutes, the [injection](<https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)> \"Injection (medicine)\") coats the walls of the vasa with a clear gel made of 60 mg of the [copolymer](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copolymer \"Copolymer\") [styrene/maleic anhydride](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Styrene_maleic_anhydride \"Styrene maleic anhydride\") (SMA) with 120 [µl](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microlitre \"Microlitre\") of the solvent [dimethyl sulfoxide](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimethyl_sulfoxide \"Dimethyl sulfoxide\"). The copolymer is made by [irradiation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irradiation \"Irradiation\") of the two [monomers](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monomer \"Monomer\") with a dose of 0.2 to 0.24 [megarad](<https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rad_(unit)> \"Rad (unit)\") for every 40 g of copolymer and a dose rate of 30 to 40 rad/s. Dr Pradeep K. Jha, a senior scientist, worked on the effects of gamma dose rate and total dose interrelation on molecular designing and biological function of polymer.[\\[11\\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-11) The source of irradiation is [cobalt-60](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cobalt-60 \"Cobalt-60\") [gamma radiation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_radiation \"Gamma radiation\").\\[_[citation needed](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_\\]\n\nThe effect the chemical has on sperm is not completely understood. Originally, researchers thought it lowered the [pH](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/PH \"PH\") of the environment enough to kill the sperm.[\\[12\\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-12)\n\nGuha theorizes that the polymer surface has a negative and positive [electric charge](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge \"Electric charge\") mosaic. Within an hour after placement the differential charge from the gel will rupture the sperm's [cell membrane](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_membrane \"Cell membrane\") as it passes through the vas, deactivating it before it can exit from the body.[\\[13\\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-13)\n\n## Safety[Edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Reversible_inhibition_of_sperm_under_guidance&action=edit&section=3 \"Edit section: Safety\")\n\nThe thoroughness of [carcinogenicity](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinogenicity \"Carcinogenicity\") and [toxicity](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity \"Toxicity\") testing in clinical trials had been questioned after [phase I](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phases_of_clinical_research#Phase_I \"Phases of clinical research\") of clinical trials on the basis of presence of styrene and maleic anhydride in the formulation. In response, Guha argued that substances can be individually toxic in nature but harmless as compounds like pure chlorine, which can melt human flesh on its own, but, when combined with sodium, it becomes sodium chloride – the basic salt that people consume in their diets. When it did not persuade [ICMR](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Council_of_Medical_Research \"Indian Council of Medical Research\") and the clinical trials did not resume by 1996, he went to the Supreme court and the next round of clinical trials resumed afterwards.[\\[14\\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-TheWire-14)\n\nIn October 2002, [India's Ministry of Health](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_health_ministry \"Indian health ministry\") aborted the clinical trials due to reports of [albumin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_serum_albumin \"Human serum albumin\") in [urine](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urine \"Urine\")\\[_[citation needed](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed \"Wikipedia:Citation needed\")_\\] and scrotal swelling in [phase III trial](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial#Phase_III \"Clinical trial\") participants. Although the [ICMR](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Council_of_Medical_Research \"Indian Council of Medical Research\") has reviewed and approved the toxicology data three times, [WHO](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization \"World Health Organization\") and Indian researchers say that the studies were not done according to recent international standards. Due to the lack of any evidence for adverse effects, trials were restarted in 2011.[\\[2\\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-Wired-2) Guha says concerns over the safety and efficacy of the drug have mainly come from the NIH and WHO.[\\[14\\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-TheWire-14)\n\n## Availability and marketing[Edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Reversible_inhibition_of_sperm_under_guidance&action=edit&section=4 \"Edit section: Availability and marketing\")\n\nBy November 2019, the [ICMR](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Council_of_Medical_Research \"Indian Council of Medical Research\") had successfully completed clinical trials of the world's first injectable male contraceptive, which was then sent to the Drug Controller General of India (DCGI) for regulatory approval. The trials were over, including extended, phase III clinical trials, for which 303 candidates were recruited with 97.3% success rate and no reported side effects.[\\[15\\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-15)\n\nIn the [developed world](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developed_world \"Developed world\"), the average time taken for a drug to go from concept to market is 10 to 15 years, whereas, it has been over four decades since Guha published his original paper on RISUG.[\\[14\\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-TheWire-14) RISUG is an inexpensive, single-use drug which does not require major surgery, thus making it an unprofitable business model for drug companies who work on the principle of continuous demand and long term profit. RISUG aims to provide males with years-long fertility control, thereby overcoming compliance problems and avoiding ongoing costs associated with condoms and the female [birth control pill](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth_control_pill \"Birth control pill\"), which must be taken daily.[\\[16\\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-16)\n\nPharmaceutical companies have expressed little interest in RISUG.[\\[17\\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-Khilwani-17) One obstacle facing marketing of the product is that men generally perceive contraception as a woman's issue. Men may also choose not to use alternative methods of contraception because there are fewer options for birth control for them than there are for women, or they may fear the side effects, or it may conflict with their cultural or religious beliefs.[\\[17\\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-Khilwani-17)\n\n## Smart RISUG[Edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Reversible_inhibition_of_sperm_under_guidance&action=edit&section=5 \"Edit section: Smart RISUG\")\n\nSmart RISUG is a newer version of the male contraception that was published in 2009. The polymer adds iron oxide and copper particles to the original compound, giving it magnetic properties and the name \"Smart RISUG\". After injection the exact location of the polymer inside the vas deferens can be measured and visualized by [X-ray](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray \"X-ray\") and [magnetic resonance imaging](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging \"Magnetic resonance imaging\"). The polymer location can also be externally controlled using a pulsed magnetic field. With this magnetic field, the polymer can change location inside the body to maximize sterility or can be removed to restore fertility. The polymer has [magnetoelastic behavior](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_magnetostrictive_effect \"Inverse magnetostrictive effect\") that allows it to stretch and elongate to better line the vas deferens. The iron oxide component is necessary to prevent agglomeration.\n\nWith the presence of iron particles, the polymer has lower protein binding and therefore prevents agglomeration. The copper particles in the compound allow the polymer to conduct heat. When an external microwave applies heat to the polymer, it can liquify the polymer again to be excreted to restore fertility. Smart RISUG is therefore a better choice for men who want to use RISUG as temporary birth control, since it does not require a second surgery to restore fertility. The addition of metal ions also increases the effectiveness of the spermicide. The low frequency electromagnetic field disintegrates the sperm cell membrane in the head region. This in turn causes both [acrosin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acrosin \"Acrosin\") and [hyaluronidase](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyaluronidase \"Hyaluronidase\") enzymes to leak out of the sperm, making the sperm infertile.\n\nThe safety of Smart RISUG is uncertain and requires additional research. The spermicidal properties of the compound should not have negative effects on the lining of the vas deferens. [Albino](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albino \"Albino\") rats used to develop the new polymer did not have any adverse symptoms.[\\[18\\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-18) The original compound had been tested for over 25 years in rats.[\\[7\\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-Francis-7)\n\n## References[Edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Reversible_inhibition_of_sperm_under_guidance&action=edit&section=6 \"Edit section: References\")\n\n1.  ^ [**_a_**](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/#cite_ref-dailypioneer_1-0) [**_b_**](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/#cite_ref-dailypioneer_1-1) Jyoti, Archana (2011-01-03).

You create notes, shuffle them around into folders, add a few tags, and then they sit there. Waiting. Until you consciously remember go looking for them.\n\nThis warehouse approach to notes requires us – the human agent in the system – to do a **lot** of cognitive labour if we want to *use* our notes. And *using* our notes is the entire point of any note-taking enterprise.\n\nMost of us have an ulterior motive beyond writing notes – we want to remember, understand, synthesise ideas, come to confident conclusions, generate new ideas informed by historical and social events, write coherent essays, or work through difficult problems.\n\nGetting to any of these outcomes requires far more work than typing words into a storage container and retrieving them again. Most note-taking software doesn't guide us towards any particular workflows or ways of thinking with our notes. We have to develop them ourselves.\n\nWe have to remember what kind of information we saved in the first place. We have to know what keywords or search methods will allow us to find it again. We have develop ways to integrate old ideas with new ones. We have to prompt ourselves to expand on our notes, combine them, synthesise them into new realisations, and critique our own conclusions.\n\nThankfully, there's a long history of people finding ways to makes these cognitive tasks easier. We can draw on well-established cultural practices and techniques; we can write and build . We can practice and . We can use to regularly resurface old ideas. We can write for an engaged and discerning public audience. We can even sign up for expensive masters degrees that will force us to ask hard questions and conjure up defensible answers.\n\nThese practices are what turns notes into understandings, conclusions, informed opinions, new ideas, and original creations. But we've yet to see note-taking software that **actively facilitates and encourages** these kind of workflows. They are, for the most part, still behaving like storage boxes.\n\nWhat if we started to think about note-taking systems as active agents, rather than receptacles?\n\nAgents can prompt you to do specific activities in a sequence. They can ask you questions. They can suggest relevant material based on what you've already written. They can periodically resurface old ideas to ask if they still ring true. They can prompt you to connect two disparate ideas together. They can mimic conversational partners who debate the strengths and weaknesses of a point – naive partners perhaps, but still better than no partner at all.\n\n\"Agents\" here are simply programmes; pre-written sequences of instructions that facilitate standardised cultural practices and repeatable ways of relating to the world.\n\nWe could, in essence, run automated programmes and algorithms over our notes. Programmes that we have the agency to write as users.\n\n## The Pattern\n\nProgrammable notes are note-taking systems that allow you to write programmatic rules that facilitate particular ways of working with your notes.\n\nBased on triggers (specific conditions are met, input from the user, time of day), they kick off a sequence of actions. Actions might be prompts for the user to answer, transformations on the notes themselves, or requests to external websites and data sources for information.\n\nWe're floating into the land of computational abstraction so let's make this tangible with some examples:\n\nI could go on, but I'll spare you from my other 99 mediocre programmatic note ideas. It's hopefully clear that the goal of these is to encourage practices like reflection, synthesis, connection, and serendipity. The goal is not to simply amass notes.\n\nNone of the automations I've suggested above are impractically complex or technologically impossible. They all follow a reasonably simple *if this, then that* structure that most of us will find familiar. Many are perfectly possible and currently used in existing platforms.\n\nThe plug-in for is the system I personally use to build these types of workflows. It offers a set of triggers, variables, and commands you can chain together into fairly readable statements like: `<%SET:topOfMindToday,<%INPUT:What's on your mind today?%>%>` or `<%RANDOMBLOCKFROM:Writing Ideas%>`.\n\nEven with limited programming knowledge, many people in the community have been able to fashion their own Smartblock flows. Plenty of them have their workflows to the community Github for others to use. These include over a selection of text, pulling data into your notes, and a flow walking you through the benefits, risks, and costs of all your options.\n\nThe UX of both Smartblocks and Roam is still pretty rough. But they're pointing towards something promising. They're also not alone in enabling users to write their own programmable notes. There are a wide range of user-created plug-ins for similar platforms like and that enable some of these same workflows.\n\nis another app that allows users to build fairly complex programmatic systems within documents. You can create buttons that trigger actions and write automation scripts with conditional logic.\n\nAnother project I'm watching closely is 's app (currently in alpha) that promises to feature *\"geists\"* – \"little scripts that find connections between notes, and use procedural generators to construct algorithmic provocations.\"\n\nThese trends all bode well for programmable notes. They prove that – given enough agency – users will enthusiastically write their own programmes that facilitate the particular note-taking practices and techniques they find valuable.\n\nThis is in action. The developers and designers of note-taking apps will never be able to create systems that suit the needs of everyone's particular knowledge management workflows. Enabling users to design and share their own is the only way to give people agency over their knowledge bases.\n\n#### But what about AI???\n\nIt is impossible to propose agentive computational systems designed to help us think better without bringing up **THE AI**. Let's first point out the term \"AI\" is a nebulous and finicky cultural narrative. People use it in all sorts of ways depending on the political agenda of the speaker.\n\nIn this context, I'm using *AI* to refer to systems that use natural language processing, neural networks, and machine learning to respond to people in seemingly 'intelligent' ways. These will play an enourmous role in the future of programmable notes.\n\nWe've yet to see note-taking platforms meaningfully add *AI* affordances into their systems, but there are hints at how they could in other platforms.\n\nThe most impressive and promising I've seen is , a research tool that helps academics and students find relevant papers and data based on natural language inputs. You can ask it a question like \"What's the point of note-taking?\" and recieve a list of research papers that are likely to hold the answer. Even better, Elicit creates a one sentence summary of the paper's main finding and presents it in the results.\n\nFinding relevant research papers is critical for academics and researchers, but isn't a large part of everyone's writing and sense-making process.\n\nElicit has an alternative suite of tools that I find much more intriguing for our use case. Using the same NLP technology you can run requests like:\n\n-   Clarify a concept\n-   Suggest similar search terms\n-   Brainstorm possible counter arguments\n-   Rephrase a sentence\n-   Help me be more specific.\n\nThese simple linguistic transformations and generative prompts don't require a high level of intellectual sophistication to be useful. Sometimes you just need a wall to bounce ideas off. And modern NLP systems are a great wall. They can give us just a touch of reflection, perspective, and serendipity when we get stuck in our own heads.\n\nTo address the slippery-slope argument, I think it's pointless to worry about these systems doing too much of our thinking for us. Rephrasing a sentence is a far cry from writing an informed and insightful social criticism essay.\n\nThey certainly might prompt us to think in novel and unfamiliar ways though. is still the end goal here. Let's hope we see more of it.\n","n":0.028}}},{"i":539,"$":{"0":{"v":"Pimoroni","n":1},"1":{"v":"\n[Pimoroni](https://learn.pimoroni.com/)\n","n":1}}},{"i":540,"$":{"0":{"v":"Peter Bevelin a Few Lessons from Sherlock Holmes","n":0.354},"1":{"v":"\n# [Peter Bevelin: A Few Lessons From Sherlock Holmes](https://fs.blog/a-few-lessons-from-sherlock-holmes/)\n\n[Peter Bevelin](https://fs.blog/intellectual-giants/peter-bevelin/)‘s first book, [Seeking Wisdom from Darwin to Munger](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1578644283/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1578644283&linkCode=as2&tag=farnamstreet-20), is one of the best books you’ve probably never heard of.

Maria Konnikova’s book, [Mastermind: How To Think Like Sherlock Holmes](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0670026573/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=farnamstreet-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=0670026573&linkId=3cc69470cef29fb1bf4a55947dbc8cfb), [takes a deep look at Sherlock Holmes’s methodology](https://fs.blog/2013/04/how-to-think-like-sherlock-holmes/) to develop the habits of mind that will allow us to mindfully engage the world.\n\nPeter’s book is shorter than Maria’s and encourages you to draw your own conclusions. He’s distilled Arthur Conan Doyle’s famous detective Sherlock Holmes into principles and quotes.\n\n> This book will appeal to both Sherlock fans as well as those who want to think better. It contains useful and timeless methods and questions applicable to a variety of important issues in life and business. We could all benefit from A few lessons from Sherlock Holmes.\n\nLet’s look at some of the lessons Bevelin brings to our attention.\n\n“What distinguishes Holmes from most mortals,” Bevelin writes, “is that he knows where to look and what questions to ask. He pays attention to the important things, and he knows where to find them.”\n\nMany ideas over a wide range of disciplines help us gain perspective (queue [mental models](https://fs.blog/mental-models/)).\n\n> Breadth of view, my dear Mr. Mac, is one of the essentials of our profession. The interplay of ideas and the oblique uses of knowledge are often of extraordinary interest.(Holmes; [The Valley of Fear](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00ARGXFAO/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=farnamstreet-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B00ARGXFAO&linkId=bbb0f49108cdb2ad87c960ca4c526243))\n\n## The Memory Attic\n\n> I consider that a man’s brain originally is like a little empty attic, and you have to stock it with such furniture as you choose. A fool takes in all the lumber of every sort that he comes across, so that the knowledge which might be useful to him gets crowded out, or at best is jumbled up with a lot of other things so that he has a difficulty in laying his hands upon it.\n> \n> Now the skillful workman is very careful indeed as to what he takes into his brain-attic. He will have nothing but the tools which may help him in doing his work, but of these he has a large assortment, and all in the most perfect order. It is a mistake to think that that little room has elastic walls and can distend to any extent. Depend upon it there comes a time when for every addition of knowledge you forget something that you knew before. It is of the highest importance, therefore, not to have useless facts elbowing out the useful ones. (Holmes; [A Study in Scarlet](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00ARGXLIK/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=farnamstreet-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B00ARGXLIK&linkId=f79395bf7ed794845bde036504f9d356))\n\n**So says the statistician.**\n\n> You can, for example, never foretell what any one man will do, but you can say with precision what an average number will be up to. Individuals vary, but percentages remain constant. (Holmes; [The Sign of the Fear](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00ARGXFAY/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=farnamstreet-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B00ARGXFAY&linkId=6ab7bbe1fa41fe743a4b5d0055711fe0))\n\n## Knowledge Doesn’t Make us Wise\n\nOne of the best things about Peter is how he adds outsiders to the mix. He inserts this quote from Montaigne:\n\n> Judgment can do without knowledge but not knowledge without judgment. ([Montaigne](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0140446044/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=farnamstreet-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=0140446044&linkId=cc546c8303536eb7c8ae4fa3c89ea2db))\n\n**Never jump to conclusions.**\n\n> I have not all my facts yet, but I do not think there are any insuperable difficulties. Still, it is an error to argue in front of your data. You find yourself insensibly twisting them round to fit your theories. (Holmes; [Wisteria Lodge](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0082XIBCQ/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=farnamstreet-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B0082XIBCQ&linkId=e95d28127b67c20a885125343e533ee2))\n\n## Don’t theorize before data.\n\n> It is a capital mistake to theorize before one has data. Insensibly one begins to twist facts to suit theories, instead of theories to suit facts. (Holmes; [A Scandal in Bohemia](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1405862335/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=farnamstreet-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=1405862335&linkId=6f72de7e051e50a4b679848467ccd882))\n\n**Make sure the facts are facts.**\n\n> I realize that if you ask people to account for “facts”, they usually spend more time finding reasons for them than finding out whether they are true. … They skip over the facts but carefully deduce inferences. They normally begin thus: “How does this come about?” But does it do so? That is what they ought to be asking. ([Montaigne](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0140446044/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=farnamstreet-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=0140446044&linkId=55505a1790439124620d7bb2b0708009))\n\n## See the Forest\n\n> The principal difficulty in your case … lay in the fact of there being too much evidence. What was vital was overlaid and hidden by what was irrelevant. Of all the facts which were presented to us we had to pick just those which we deemed to be essential, and then piece them together in their order, so as to reconstruct this very remarkable chain of events. (Holmes; [The Naval Treaty](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00AR1TDQE/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=farnamstreet-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B00AR1TDQE&linkId=d687b49f2297eee63a72b5feeeca6170))\n\nSmall things may be important.\n\n> The smallest point may be the most essential. (Holmes; [A Study in Scarlet](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00ARGXLIK/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=farnamstreet-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B00ARGXLIK&linkId=e1de3d9bbf540f5ebea9aaf500a850de))\n\n## We see but don’t Observe\n\n> What we see is all we think is there — What often leads us astray in an investigation is that we adopt the theory which is most likely to account for the “visible” and found facts but what if the important is left out? What is not reported, withheld, hidden?\n\n**Take time to think things over.**\n\n> Sherlock Holmes was a man … who, when he had an unsolved problem upon his mind, would go for days, and even for a week, without rest, turning it over, rearranging his facts, looking at it from every point of view until he had either fathomed it or convinced himself that his data were insufficient. (Dr. Watson; [The Man with the Twisted Lip](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07BRK4WK6/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=farnamstreet-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B07BRK4WK6&linkId=a0b9fd92948579ebb6171927aeb7e332))\n\n\\*\\*\\*\n\nPeter’s books tend to become very hard to find a few months after they are released.

To store and organize knowledge bases, we need digital solutions to help us. But that's *not enough*. To keep things manageable over time as our knowledge base scales, we need clear techniques and methodologies.\n\n### What is this?\n\nI've been passionate about information, knowledge management, and PKM for more than 20 years. As a knowledge worker, author, blogger, and entrepreneur, I needed solutions to store and organize an enormous amount of information.\n\nOver the years, I've explored, used, and advocated many different tools: old-school wikis (e.g., MediaWiki, TiddlyWiki, DokuWiki, Confluence), note-taking solutions such as Evernote, Google Keep, Microsoft OneNote, Okular, Zim, and many more.\n\nRecently, the Personal Knowledge Management space has evolved **a lot** with the rise of tools such as Notion, Obsidian, Roam Research, LogSeq, and others. Those have *drastically* changed the knowledge management landscape and brought us the opportunity to manage knowledge much more efficiently, and to truly create ourselves a second brain, or digital garden.\n\nDuring most of 2021, I've done extensive research and curated a ton of information and links about the Personal Knowledge Management space. I've now regrouped all of this inside of a Notion space.\n\nIt is now a solid database of the best resources you can find on the subject around the Internet\n\n**Each and every week I add new resources to this Notion space:** articles, blogs, books, courses, tools, videos, etc. This includes the content that I [publish](https://dsebastien.net/blog/2021-12-03-personal-knowledge-management-organization) [myself](https://dsebastien.net/blog/2021-10-07-periodic-journaling-part-1) on [the subject](https://dsebastien.net/blog/2022-02-08-why-you-should-take-notes-while-reading) and [my weekly newsletter](https://newsletter.dsebastien.net/).\n\n###   \nWhat you will get\n\nHere, you can buy lifetime access to my Notion space, and get **regular updates**; either for you personally, or for your team.\n\nWhat's included?\n\n-   A list of 240+ tools\n-   Links to 250+ articles\n-   Links to 125+ videos\n-   A list of 85+ books about learning, thinking, writing, note-taking, journaling, neuroscience, psychology, stoicism, etc\n-   Links to 180+ sites & blogs\n-   A list of 60+ Youtube channels\n-   A list of 65+ courses\n-   A list of 65+ newsletters\n-   A list of 35+ podcasts\n-   A list of 55+ communities and forums\n-   A list of ~1.6K PKM leaders, influencers, and enthusiasts\n-   A list of 40+ starter kits and templates\n-   A list of 100+ Twitter hashtags to follow\n-   A list of 80+ topics and links to relevant articles, books, videos, etc\n\nI will keep adding to the Notion space, and I'll continue contributing information for the whole community.\n\n### Tiered pricing\n\nThe pricing for the PKM Library is tiered.

He asks in his paper that identified the \"2 Sigma Problem\": how do we achieve these results in conditions more practical (i.e., more scalable) than one-to-one tutoring?\n>\n> In a related vein, [this large-scale meta-analysis](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.3102/0034654317751919) shows large (>0.5 [Cohen's d](https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Cohen%27s_d)) effects from direct instruction using mastery learning. \"Yet, despite the very large body of research supporting its effectiveness, DI has not been widely embraced or implemented.\"\n\n---\n\nAnswering the question requires first to explain what _Direct Instruction_ and _Mastery Learning_ mean.\n\n## Scope of the present article\n\nThis article is concerned with a general study of Bloom's two sigma problem, which in turn involves an examination of an educational method, mastery learning, and tutoring. I have also included a review of software-based tutoring. Later on I look at educational research in general, spaced repetition, and deliberate practice, as these seem closely related to the core topics of this review for reasons that will be obvious after reading through it.\n\nI am only concerned here with student performance in tests, not with other putative benefits from education; I don't look in detail at what keeps students motivated, what makes them feel well, what makes them more creative, or better citizens.. I could have looked at longer term measures of success (e.g. income later on in life) but I couldn't find such studies.\n\nAs a general note, when discussing effect sizes here, unless otherwise noted, the effect sizes are of the intervention being discussed vs business as usual, using whatever educational method the school was using.\n\n## Definitions\n\n### The Two Sigma problem\n\nBenjamin Bloom, decades ago, [found](http://web.mit.edu/5.95/www/readings/bloom-two-sigma.pdf) that individual tutoring raised student's performance relative to a baseline class by two standard deviations, which is a MASSIVE[1](https://nintil.com/#massive) effect. As 1:1 tutoring is very expensive, he wondered if there are approaches that approximate such an effect that were applicable for larger classrooms. Finding such a method was the \"two sigma problem\". And Mastery Learning seemed to be the promising way to solve it.\n\n![Image result for bloom two sigma](inbox/assets/Image%20result%20for%20bloom%20two%20sigma.png)\n\n### Direct Instruction\n\nFrom the meta-analysis cited above, Direct Instruction is a teaching program originally developed by Siegfried Engelmann in the 60s that assumes that any student can learn any given piece of material, and this will happen when\n\n> (a) they have mastered prerequisite knowledge and skills and (b) the instruction is unambiguous.\n\nThis doesn't sound that helpful; fortunately the [National Institute for Direct Instruction](https://www.nifdi.org/what-is-di/basic-philosophy.html) has a bit more information.\n\n> There are four main features of DI that ensure students learn faster and more efficiently than any other program or technique available:\n>\n> **Students are placed in instruction at their skill level.** When students begin the program, each student is tested to find out which skills they have already mastered and which ones they need to work on. From this, students are grouped together with other students needing to work on the same skills. These groups are organized by the level of the program that is appropriate for students, rather than the grade level the students are in.\n>\n> **The program’s structure is designed to ensure mastery of the content.** The program is organized so that skills are introduced gradually, giving children a chance to learn those skills and apply them before being required to learn another new set of skills. Only 10% of each lesson is new material. The remaining 90% of each lesson’s content is review and application of skills students have already learned but need practice with in order to master. Skills and concepts are taught in isolation and then integrated with other skills into more sophisticated, higher-level applications. All details of instruction are controlled to minimize the chance of students' misinterpreting the information being taught and to maximize the reinforcing effect of instruction.\n>\n> **Instruction is modified to accommodate each student’s rate of learning.** A particularly wonderful part about DI is that students are retaught or accelerated at the rate at which they learn. If they need more practice with a specific skill, teachers can provide the additional instruction within the program to ensure students master the skill. Conversely, if a student is easily acquiring the new skills and needs to advance to the next level, students can be moved to a new placement so that they may continue adding to the skills they already possess.\n>\n> **Programs are field tested and revised before publication.** DI programs are very unique in the way they are written and revised before publication. All DI programs are field tested with real students and revised based on those tests before they are ever published. This means that the program your student is receiving has already been proven to work.\n\nDirect Instruction is [highly scripted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scripted_teaching), [_including even the words they should speak while teaching_](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Contemporary_Educational_Psychology/Chapter_8:_Instructional_Strategies/Mastery_Learning).\n\nNote that Direct Instruction (titlecase) is not the same as [direct instruction](https://www.nifdi.org/what-is-di/di-vs-di) (lowercase), there are various programmes around that have \"direct instruction\" in the name, like [Explicit Direct Instruction](https://dataworks-ed.com/blog/2014/07/direct-instruction-di-vs-explicit-direct-instruction-edi/) . Unless otherwise noted, we'll be talking about Direct Instruction in this review. Both are teacher-centered methods in that the teacher is seen as the one who is transmitting knowledge to the student rather than, say, the student being aided by the teacher in a quest to discover knowledge. Direct Instruction is regulated by the National Institute for Direct Instruction, as mentioned above, while direct instruction is not.\n\n### Mastery learning\n\nMastery learning (ML) is not the same as Direct Instruction, but ML _is a component of Direct Instruction_. It is also one of the methods Bloom originally looked at, so we also examine ML in this review. One key difference is that ML does not called for scripted lessons, while DI requires them.\n\nThe key principle of ML is simply to force students to master a lesson before moving on to the next one. At the end of each lesson, on a monthly or weekly basis, students' knowledge is tested. Those students that do not pass are given remediation classes, and they have to re-sit the test until they master it. This can be done in a group setting, as with Bloom's original Learning for Mastery (LFM) programme, or individually, as in Keller's Personalized System of Instruction (PSI), where each student advances as their own pace.\n\n## Summary\n\n- The literatures examined here are full of small sample, non-randomized trials, and highly heterogeneous results.\n- Tutoring in general, most likely, does not reach the 2-sigma level that Bloom suggested. Likewise, it's unlikely that mastery learning provides a 1-sigma improvement.\n  - But high quality tutors, and high quality software are likely able to reach a 2-sigma improvement and beyond.\n- All the methods (mastery learning, direct instruction, tutoring, software tutoring, deliberate practice, and spaced repetition) studied in this essay are found to work to various degrees, outlined below.\n- This essay covers many kinds of subjects being taught, and likewise many groups (special education vs regular schools, college vs K-12). The effect sizes reported here are averages that serve as general guidance.\n- The methods studied tend to be more effective for lower skilled students relative to the rest.\n- The methods studied work at all levels of education, with the exception of direct instruction: There is no evidence to judge its effectiveness at the college level.\n- The methods work substantially better when clear objectives and facts to be learned are set. There is little evidence of [learning transfer](https://www.econlib.org/archives/2012/08/low_transfer_of.html): Practicing or studying X subject does not improve much performance outside of X.\n- There is some suggestive evidence that the underlying reasons these methods work are increased and repeated exposure to the material, the [testing effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testing_effect), and fine-grained feedback on performance in the case of tutoring.\n- Long term studies tend to find evidence of a fade-out effect, effect sizes decrease over time. This is likely due to the skills being learned not being practiced.\n\n## Effect sizes\n\nAssessing if an effect size is meaningful may be hard. A common way of doing so is as [follows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effect_size):\n\n| _Effect size_ | _d_  |\n| ------------- | ---- |\n| Very small    | 0.01 |\n| Small         | 0.20 |\n| Medium        | 0.50 |\n| Large         | 0.80 |\n| Very large    | 1.20 |\n| Huge          | 2.0  |\n\nHowever, one should be able to finetune the descriptive language used, by using a domain-specific reference. In this case, the average effect on performance from one year of schooling (going from 5th to 6th grade) is d=0.26 for reading performance, and the average effect from 141 large scale RCTs of educational interventions is 0.06, from Hugues & Matthew ([2019](http://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/141754/)). Because of this, I will be using a scale adapted from Kraft ([2018](https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/mkraft/files/kraft_2018_interpreting_effect_sizes.pdf)):\n\n| _Effect size_ (E.S.) | _d_      |\n| -------------------- | -------- |\n| Small                | <0.05    |\n| Medium               | 0.05-0.2 |\n| Large                | 0.2-0.5  |\n| Very large           | 0.5-1    |\n| Extremely large      | 1-1.5    |\n| Huge                 | \\>1.5    |\n\nWith that in mind, here is the summary of the main results, along with the best studies I could find to back up the claims. For comparison, I include Bloom's findings:\n\n| _Method_                                 | E.S. (general) | E.S. (disadvantaged) | E.S.

This is no \"mixed results\" literature, which by itself is quite surprising, _even suspicious_; it is rarely the case that I find something so good and apparently uncontroversial.\n\nDI/ML is what, as the meme goes, peak education looks like; you might not like it but it's the truth (as far as test scores are concerned).\n\n> In the late 1960s, DI was accepted as one of the programs to be part of Project Follow Through, a very large government-funded study that compared the outcomes of over 20 different educational interventions in high-poverty communities over a multiyear period. Communities throughout the nation selected programs to be implemented in their schools, and DI was chosen by 19 different sites, encompassing a broad range of demographic and geographic characteristics. External evaluators gathered and analyzed outcome data using a variety of comparison groups and analysis techniques. The final results indicated that DI was the only intervention that had significantly positive impacts on all of the outcome measures (Adams, 1996; Barbash, 2012; Bereiter & Kurland, 1996; Engelmann 2007; Engelmann, Becker, Carnine, & Gersten, 1988; Kennedy, 1978). The developers of DI had hoped that the conclusions of the Project Follow Through evaluators would lead to widespread adoption of the programs, but a variety of political machinations seem to have resulted in the findings being known to only a few scholars and policy makers (Grossen, 1996; Watkins, 1996).\n\nSome of [those interventions](https://psych.athabascau.ca/open/engelmann/direct-evid.php) are (And I hadn't heard of them before): Direct Instruction, Parent Education, Behaviour analysis, Southwest Labs, Bank Street, Responsive Education, TEEM, Cognitive Curriculum, and Open Education.\n\nMost of these actually caused **a substantially lower performance** compared to traditional school instruction. This supports the idea that at least on the metrics measured by Follow Through, the choice of educational methodology matters. In particular, the worst performer, [Open Education](https://www.wrightslaw.com/info/teach.profession.carnine.pdf) sounds like something hip teachers would find cool:\n\n> focused on building the child’s responsibility for his own learning. Reading and writing are not taught directly, but through stimulating the desire to communicate. Flexible schedules, child-directed choices, and a focus on intense personal involvement characterize this model.\n\nThe effect sizes found in the meta-analysis are around 0.5, which, in the social sciences are considered to be fairly high.\n\nThe paper also looks at variability of the results between studies. Because methodology differs, it could be that the estimate is overstated because of the overabundance of shoddy studies. But even when controlling for everything you might think you can control for, the effects still remain, or so they claim; and the control variables did little to reduce it: It seems a very robust effect that shows up no matter how you slice the data.\n\nAs far as meta-analysis go, this is good, perhaps too good. I am reminded of [Daryl Bem](https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/04/28/the-control-group-is-out-of-control/)'s now infamous meta-analysis on the possibility of some people being able to see the future. If the underlying literature is not good then the meta-analysis will yield biased estimates.\n\n## Critiques of DI\n\nSounding suspiciously good, I tried explicitly searching for criticism of DI.\n\nOne broad critique, more of a warning is that a substantial part of the literature on DI has been produced by people associated with the National Institute for Direct Instruction (NIDI), including the meta-analysis with which this article begins; that said the meta-analysis itself found no difference between the NIDI-sponsored studies and other studies.\n\nHere's [one](https://www.seattletimes.com/education-lab/guest-the-drawbacks-of-direct-instruction/) professor of education, saying that sure, DI works at what it's designed to do, but, he argues, the price is an environment devoid of creativity, joy, and spontaneity. He does not give evidence for this, nor were these tested in the meta-analysis from before.\n\n[Alfie Kohn](https://www.alfiekohn.org/article/early-childhood-education/), an education researcher has an essay up with a critique of DI, starting with the Follow Through study. He also mentions that DI techniques have led, in some cases he cites, to students knowing well the material but being incapable of a deeper understanding or generalization.\n\nEppley & Dudley-Marling ([2018](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/15505170.2018.1438321)) find the DI literature wanting. They look at work published between 2002 and 2013 and find that the literature is low quality, claiming that it doesn't work at all, except in a very limited number of cases, with a small effect. But they don't seem to quantify this, it's not a meta-analysis, nor do they comment on previous systematic reviews and meta-analysis that do find positive effects.\n\nThe What Works Clearinghouse reviewed 7 studies of Direct Instruction, out of which only one was considered good enough to include in their summary of evidence. They concluded that it [has no effect](https://ies.ed.gov/ncee/wwc/EvidenceSnapshot/139). The [study in question](https://ies.ed.gov/ncee/wwc/Study/64604) was an RCT with 164 students with learning disabilities and very low IQ (mean 76) at a pre-school level (mean age ~5).\n\nAs one might imagine, the NIDI people have a page dedicated to answer the [above](https://www.nifdi.org/research/reviews-of-di/what-works-clearinghouse.html). Now, given that the WWC didn't review that many studies, and the study they did look at was a very atypical sample, I'm going to ignore this and look at more studies.\n\nI have to mention that one of the authors of the meta-analysis co-authored a paper (Stockton & Wood, ([2016](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1098214016662338))) where they question that priority should be given to RCTs when assessing the quality of the evidence.\n\nOn the other hand, the anti-DI camp also has their share of [bad arguments](https://www.nifdi.org/news-latest-2/blog-hempenstall/389-why-does-direct-instruction-evoke-such-rancour).\n\nTable 1 in the meta-analysis, discussing effect sizes (average is ~0.5) have tight confidence intervals around that value. But then, when we get to table 3 discussing the effects of study designs on the effect sizes, we see that the effect of a study being randomised is quite negative, and so is adjusting for initial scores or IQ. Sample size itself didn't have much of an effect.\n\nLet's try to look at the best studies, and see what we find. They mention that there is an appendix with the specific studies they looked at, but I couldn't access it.\n\n| Paper                                                                                                                                                                           | Sample size              | Focus                                                                                                                                     | Effect size                                                                                                                                                              |\n| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| Stockard et al.

In all cases, disadvantaged students, in the 1.18 case, mentally retarded students. The RCT is an unpublished PhD thesis. |\n\nI am sampling a few, but not cherry-picking: A pattern emerges: most DI studies are done on underprivileged students. It can be, and indeed, it is, the case, as we'll see later with mastery learning, that educational methods have more of an impact on those lower skilled kids. In the Stockard meta-analysis there is a reference to a [1999 review](https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED460429.pdf) focusing on general education, rather than disadvantaged students, but they cite no specific papers beyond a 1996 book from Adams and Engelmann (1996), the originators of DI. The average effect they found was .87, not being much different between regular education and special education, and the effects were larger (Above 1 sigma) for adults.\n\nBut then, given that this effect is twice as large as the one found in the later meta-analyses makes you wonder about the quality of the literature. After reviewing the literature, there does seem to be some evidence that there is an effect from DI on kids with low skills, this effect being probably not larger than 0.4. For regular kids, we don't have much to work with. This may be one of the reasons why DI has not been more widely adopted in general.\n\n## The evidence for mastery learning\n\nThe most well known large-scale implementation of mastery learning is Khan Academy. There was an [RCT](https://www.povertyactionlab.org/evaluation/impact-online-math-learning-platform-test-scores-and-attitudes-towards-math-brazil) ongoing, showing no meaningful effects.\n\nBest Evidence Encyclopedia, maintained by Robert Slavin, a website collecting evidence on what works in education, [did](http://www.bestevidence.org/word/mhs_math_Oct_21_2008.pdf) a [review](http://www.bestevidence.org/overviews/M/mastery.htm) on diverse methods for teaching Maths, finding no effect in middle/high school, and limited evidence of a larger effect for elementary school. (They only included five studies, with effect sizes ranging from -0.18 to 1.08)).\n\nThis may sound surprising in light of the above. But a likely explanation is that all these studies are not using the exact same methodology. With Direct Instruction, we have an Institute regulating what DI is and how exactly it has to be done. With mastery learning, it's unclear exactly what counts and what doesn't.\n\nThe meta-analytic literature on mastery learning goes back to 1983, the last study of that period, Kulik et al. ([1990](http://www.uky.edu/~gmswan3/575/kulik_kulik_Bangert-Drowns_1990.pdf)) found large effect sizes for less able students (d=0.61) and medium sized for more able students (d=0.4), noting also that the difference between these two groups is not statistically significant in their sample. This meta-analysis covers programmes ranging from a few weeks to a few months, K-12 education, and college, and all kinds of subjects and mastery levels (Some variants of ML asked for perfection, others were okay with 80% on tests to advance to the next unit). As in Bloom's study, more demanding mastery learning methods yielded better results, with the most difference seemingly being between the 81-90 and the 91-100 studies. In other words, increasing the requirement from, say 70% to 80% doesn't do much, but increasing it to 90% or 100% (perfection) does. Importantly, the outcome varied substantially depending on how students were tested, a topic we'll return to in the next sections. When considering only standardised tests, not designed by the teachers or experimenters themselves, the effect size is tiny (0.08), while those that used experimenter/teacher made tests got a more impressive 0.5. When just the mastery learning programme that Bloom designed (Learning For Mastery,LFM) is included, the effect size rises to 0.59.\n\nCook et al. ([2013](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/c717/d8c6cd6fe951d115e509362a600601a886f7.pdf)) studied mastery learning as applied to medical education, covering 82 studies, finding an large improvement in skills (ES=1.29), and moderately large ones for patient outcomes (ES=0.73). Findings were highly heterogeneous, and so the authors caution that they have to be interpreted on a case by case basis. If this were true, it would be great news for healthcare!\n\nIn the most common general assessment of mastery learning, by Guskey ([2015](https://tguskey.com/wp-content/uploads/Mastery-Learning-1-Mastery-Learning.pdf)) is also favourable to it. There is one exception to the generally favourable systematic reviews and meta-analyses, Slavin ([1987](https://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/DigitalEducation/slavin.1987.mastery%20learning%20reconsidered.pdf)) who picked a subset of the literature he deemed to be of higher quality, finding almost zero effects. Later studies kept finding positive effects; Guskey refers readers[3](https://nintil.com/#guskey) to Kulik et al. ([1990](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1170614)) as for why many thought Slavin's review was not a good one. It's useful to stop here to explain what Slavin's critique was and what the replies were, and I'll do that in the next section. I'll just finish reviewing other meta-analyses first.\n\n[Summaedu.org](https://www.summaedu.org/mastery-learning/ta/pdf/?lang=en) compiles other meta-analyses. Oddly, an earlier meta-analysis also by Kulik ([1983](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1984-07913-001)) found a small effect size (0.05), similar to what Slavin would find later in his 1987 paper. The earlier meta-analysis covers grade 6 through 12, and the authors say that for college students they still believe effects are large. Even then, the 1990 and 1987 metas are not covering the same literature, not even for K-12 education (remember, the 1990 meta aims to cover all levels) if you look at the studies covered. The 1987 paper aims to cover all kinds of mastery learning implementations, the 1990 focuses on two (Personalized System of Instruction, and Learning For Mastery). To make things more puzzling, there is one more meta-analysis from Kulik ([1987](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.2190/FG7X-7Q9V-JX8M-RDJP)) that again says mastery learning works also for pre-college education. Wtf!\n\nSo what's up with the 1983 paper?\n\n| Paper                                | Studies | Focus                                        | Effect size | Systems covered |\n| ------------------------------------ | ------- | -------------------------------------------- | ----------- | --------------- |\n| Bangert-Drowns, Kulik & Kulik (1983) | 51      | Secondary school                             | 0.05        | IPI, PLAN, PSI  |\n| Kulik, Kulik & Bangert-Drowns (1990) | 108     | All the literature, but mostly college level | 0.52        | PSI, LFM        |\n\nOne might thus think that the difference is because the effects at college level are far higher and the 1990 paper didn't disaggregate. But no, the effect sizes for pre-college level in the 1990 paper are in line with the ~0.5 figure. The key bit here, and what Summaedu.org missed is that the studies in the 1983 meta are not necessarily mastery learning studies, they are \"individualized systems of instruction\":\n\n> Fifty-one studies met all the requirements that we established for inclusion in the meta-analysis. The first of these requirements was use of an individualized teaching system in the experimental class. Criteria for individualized systems included division of course content into chapter-length units, use of class time for individual work by students, and emphasis on formative testing. **In most classes using individualized systems, students are free to move at different rates through course material and have to demonstrate mastery to advance from one unit to another,** **but we did not consider these absolute requirements for individualization**. Our criteria for individualized systems were thus similar to those used by Hartley (1978) in her study of \"individual learning packages.\"\n\nSo that's it? Not quite, because the paper also disaggregates studies by whether or not they had a mastery requirement, and the effect size found for studies (26 of them) using ML was found to be 0.05, so we get our mystery back, in an even stronger form.\n\nThe solution is in Kulik & Kulik ([1989](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0883035589900529)), there they state side by side that Bloom's LFM does have the expected half-sigma effect, while the _Individual Learning Packages_ covered in the 1983 paper has a 0.1 effect. But why? The only plausible explanation is that there are major differences between the way IPI and PLAN work and the way PSI and LFM works, and that the effects from IPI/PLAN swamp those of PSI and LFM in the meta-analysis. Indeed, if we go to individual studies in the meta and look at those with negative effect sizes, those do not seem to be LFM/PSI. But then, what makes [IPI](http://www.ascd.org/publications/newsletters/education-update/sept94/vol36/num07/Breaking-the-Lockstep.aspx) so different? It does sound sufficiently close to what mastery learning is:\n\n> Individually Prescribed Instruction (IPI), developed at the University of Pittsburgh, was based on a “diagnostic-prescriptive” teaching cycle. The teacher used placement tests to assign each student to a particular unit in reading, Math, or science. Then the student worked independently with appropriate materials. The teacher assessed whether the student had attained mastery, assigning extra work if necessary.\n\nExcept that in IPI, when a student fails to progress, they re-study the same materials, while in LFM/PSI they get new materials, designed for students who failed [the first time](http://www.ascd.org/ASCD/pdf/journals/ed_lead/el_197605_brandt.pdf).\n\nI couldn't find much work on IPI. But tentatively, it does seem like mastery learning works -only if- the remedial activities are sufficiently good.\n\n## Slavin's critique\n\nSlavin's critique is not a meta-analysis, but what he calls \"best-evidence synthesis\". In the event that a research literature is full of shoddy papers, one has to go first through the work of throwing away studies that are not good enough to include in a meta-analysis, and this is what he does.\n\nWhen reviewing what mastery learning is, he notes that mastery learning might indeed work because of longer exposure to the teaching material, but that this poses a dilemma for slower students: Maybe they would be better off covering more material in less depth than covering less material but fully mastering it. Teaching time is, after all, limited.\n\nWhen looking at two studies that controlled for teaching time, if one looks at \"learning per hour\", mastery learning heavily (d=-1) underperformed regular instruction. Mastery learning, it might be, works better, but is less efficient than regular learning. In the case of Bloom's own work, the extra time allocated for remediation classes sums up to an extra day per week. So, Slavin argues, one should control for time spent learning, because what is doing the work here might just be exposure to the material, not anything specific to mastery learning., and not every study does this. Note that many ML proponents do also claim that even _per unit of teaching_ , ML is more effective too.\n\nAnother issue is that of experimenters coming up with tests that target well what the ML students learn, but that matches less what the control group learns, thus biasing the evaluation. An example of this is a study from 1976 (Anderson, Scott, and Hutlock) that looked at effect sizes in Maths knowledge in grades 1-6 both at the end of the instructional period (d=.64) and three months later (d=.49). But then, when experimental and control groups were tested on an external mathematics test, not designed by the experiments, the effect size was negligible. Similarly in other study (Taylor, 1973) that looked at differences in \"minimal essential skills\" for algebra and \"skills beyond essential\" found that while for minimal skills the ML students did better, this was not so for those other skills, where they underperformed the control group. This study technically did not use ML as such (The amount of testing and corrective feedback sessions was limited to one per semester, ML demands a more fine-grained approach, at least once a month), but it is fair to bring it up when discussing the tradeoffs between learning a few basics well vs learning more advanced knowledge, but less well.\n\nThen Slavin moves on to describe what criteria he will use to select valid studies; for example he will not consider studies that merely compare the results of a class in year 1 with the results of a new incoming class in year 2, taught with mastery learning: They are not the same students, and other things may have changed to alter the results. Second he discards studies that do not adjust for initial differences in skill in the control/experiment groups. Third, he discards studies that lasted less than 4 weeks. Fourth, he discard studies that less than two control groups and two experimental groups. This is to avoid effects from individual teachers or classes (Remember that most of these studies are not RCTs) .\n\nNow, considering the actual evidence, he looks at various claims.\n\n**Mastery learning is better, adjusting for time spent. Students are better prepared even for concepts that are not explicitly tested in the periodic assessments.**\n\nOnly 7 studies met Slavin's quality criteria (and most of these are randomised), finding indeed a median effect size of ~0, with the maximum being 0.25, and even that study had issues, he claims. Sample sizes here range from 6 classrooms the least, and 4 entire schools at most, covering Math and reading, in grades 1 to 9. The studies ran for between 5 weeks and a year. Note, this is for the claim \"Given the same amount of instruction\".\n\n**Mastery learning is better, adjusting for time spent. Students are better prepared, but only for those concepts explicitly tested in the periodic assessments.**\n\nNine studies are deemed good enough, finding a median effect size of 0.255 (ranging from 0.18 to 0.27), but the studies are heterogeneous in design. One of the excluded studies is a rather large study undertaken in Chile, in that case the effect size was close to the median, but when breaking down in high/low performance students, it was found that the effect was larger for low performers (.58) and zero for high ability kids. Slavin excludes this study because the mean SES and IQ of the classes using mastery learning in that case was higher, and no adjustments were made for that. In the studies that measured retention (A few weeks or months after the last exam), most of them find insignificant differences between control and experiment.\n\nIn one of the studies that was included (Mevarech, 1986), done by a student of Bloom in Israel, the effect size for low ability kids (proxied by the fact that their parents did not go to high school) got close to the fabled two sigma (1.78); at the other end kids whose parents went to college also improved a lot, but not as much (0.66). Slavin then goes into why this was the case, he finds two possible issues: One was that while students were randomly assigned, teachers were not, and so it could be that some teachers were incredibly good, or others were incredibly bad. Another is that perhaps the teachers used mastery learning focused more on the _specific concepts that would be in the test_ rather than teaching more general knowledge.\n\n**Mastery learning is better, if no adjustments for time spent are made**\n\nFour studies meet the criteria here, effect size of around zero, and same for longer term retention studies. There are of course a few studies that find larger effect sizes, which Slavin discusses.\n\nSlavin concludes,\n\n> The best evidence from evaluations of practical applications of group-based mastery learning indicates that effects of these methods are moderately positive on experimenter-made achievement measures closely tied to the objectives taught in the mastery learning classes and are essentially nil on standardized achievement measures. These findings may be interpreted as supporting the \"weak claim\" that mastery learning can be an effective means of holding teachers and students to a specified set of instructional objectives, but do not support the \"strong claim\" that mastery learning is more effective than traditional instruction given equal time and achievement measures that assess coverage as well as mastery. Further, even this \"curricular focus\" claim is undermined by uncertainties about the degree to which control teachers were trying to achieve the same objectives as the mastery learning teachers and by a failure to show effects of mastery learning on retention measures.\n>\n> These conclusions are radically different from those drawn by earlier reviewers and meta-analysts. Not only would a mean effect size across the 17 studies emphasized in this review come nowhere near the mean of around 1.0 claimed by Bloom (1984a, 1984b), Guskey and Gates (1985), Lysakowski and Walberg (1982), or Walberg (1984), but no single study reached this level. Only 2 of the 17 studies, both by the same author, had mean effect sizes in excess of the 0.52 mean estimated by Kulik et al. (1986) for precollege studies of mastery testing. How can this gross discrepancy be reconciled?\n\nOne, that Slavin is throwing away studies he deems of poor quality. In general, he is retaining about a quarter of the studies that are included in the meta-analysis discussed above. Another, Slavin is also including unpublished studies, on the grounds that those are less likely to suffer from publication bias. Also, Slavin explicitly corrected scores for initial ability, something the meta-analyses didn't do.\n\nSlavin then goes into the theoretical reasons why, even when mastery learning sounds so compelling, it may not do much.\n\nIt may be that the teachers are not properly trained, or that the material used for corrective instruction is suboptimal. Indeed he points to some studies where these two issues were corrected, and they found a positive effect after a year of instruction; Mevarech also stressed (in a personal communication to Slavin) that the quality of this material is key. Or maybe those extra corrective lessons need even more time to be effective:\n\n> Studies of students' pace through individualized materials routinely find that the slowest students require 200-600% more time than the fastest students to complete the same amount of material (Arlin & Westbury, 1976; Carroll, 1963; Suppes, 1964), far more than what schools using mastery learning are likely to be able to provide for corrective instruction (Arlin, 1982).\n\nOr, it could also be that feedback should be provided on a daily basis, not on weekly tests.\n\nAs to why mastery learning might work, Slavin thinks that a big part of why mastery learning may work in some cases is not holding students up to mastery and giving them remedial activities, but instead **merely testing them and giving them feedback about what they don't know**, and then moving on to the next lesson. In one study he cites where these two regimes were tested (teaching-evaluation-corrective and teaching-evaluation), both sets of students outperformed a control class that had less frequent tests, but they were not that different from each other, what is known as the _testing effect_.\n\nOn Bloom's two sigma problem, he finds issue with the framing itself:\n\n> The 2-sigma challenge (or 1-sigma claim) is misleading out of context and potentially damaging to educational research both within and outside of the mastery learning tradition, as it may lead researchers to belittle true, replicable, and generalizable achievement effects in the more realistic range of 20-50% of an individual-level standard deviation. For example, an educational intervention that produced a reliable gain of .33 each year could, if applied to lower class schools, wipe out the typical achievement gap between lower and middle-class children in 3 years—no small accomplishment. Yet the claims for huge effects made by Bloom and others could lead researchers who find effect sizes of \"only\" .33 to question the value of their methods.\n\nAnd there's something to that: I'm doing a review of mastery learning instead of any other thing because of Bloom's claim of a large effect!\n\nBloom himself ([1987](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.3102/00346543057004507)) replied that proper mastery learning under his LFM system has to involve students helping each other work through the corrective activities. Only one of the studies in Slavin's first claim examination meets Bloom's definition. On experimenter-made vs standardised test measures, he rather prefers the experimenter/teacher-made tests as they cover the exact intended objectives of the teaching. He gets quite emotional at the end(!)\n\n> It is a crime against mankind to deprive children of successful learning when it is possible for virtually all to learn to a high level.\n\nSlavin ([1987](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.3102/00346543057002231)) reviews the critique above, and others, noting first that there are are only few points of agreement. They agree on the fact that LFM has no effects on standardised test performance, mastery learning effects are far less than 1 sigma in studies that last at least 4 weeks (Slavin would rather use a more stringent threshold), and mastery learning does need additional time of instruction to be effective (Bloom explicitly argues that this is needed for the method to work).\n\nThe points of disagreement lie in the validity of assessment by standardised tests. These tests cover more than what is necessarily taught in the mastery learning groups, and cannot be \"overfitted\" as easily by the mastery learning teachers, as they don't know the exact contents.\n\nLater on, Slavin ([1989](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Robert_Slavin/publication/237591345_On_Mastery_Learning_and_Mastery_Teaching_Research_does_not_support_that_group-based_mastery_learning_or_Madeline_Hunter's_methods_increase_student_achievement/links/549812260cf2519f5a1db572/On-Mastery-Learning-and-Mastery-Teaching-Research-does-not-support-that-group-based-mastery-learning-or-Madeline-Hunters-methods-increase-student-achievement.pdf)) published an article, after having received the critiques cited above. As far as I know, there are no further replies to his comments. He goes over the comments that others (The Kuliks, Guskey, Bloom,...) of his review. Guskey went as far as implying that Slavin was deliberately trying to discredit mastery learning, even when, according to Slavin, he has no issue with it, and his (Slavin)'s own educational method - Success for All - is based on mastery learning too! The criterion that excluded most of the studies from the analysis was looking at longer-term (more than 1 month) studies, which doesn't seem unfair to me. After all, what killed the literature on cognitive gains at the pre-K level was also this fadeout effect over time.\n\nAnd finally, in Mastery Learning Re-Reconsidered (Slavin, [1990](http://competencyworks.pbworks.com/w/file/fetch/70372686/1170613.pdf)) replies to the Kulik-Kulik-Bangert-Drowns reply mentioned above. Even after including newer studies, if one applies Slavin's methodological criteria to the more recent papers, the value in the Kulik et al. meta analysis would be the same as Slavin found.\n\n> However, the main issue of the effectiveness of mastery learning boils down to a question of values. The findings of positive effects of mastery learning on experimenter-made measures can be interpreted as supporting the view that this technique can help focus teachers on a given set of objectives. Educators who value this have a good rationale for using group-based mastery learning. However, the claim that mastery learning can accelerate achievement in general in elementary and secondary schools is still awaiting convincing evidence.\n\nThe Kulik, Kulk & Bangert-Drowns (1990) reply to Slavin I mentioned above is brief, saying that he did not consider other systems of mastery learning (Slavin looked at group-based (LFM) rather than individual-based (PSI) studies), and that he mostly focused on pre-college studies, while most LFM work is done at college level. The authors say they think Slavin does not disagree with them if one limits oneself to the literature examined by Slavin, with the exception of the inclusion on Slavin's paper of some studies that did not have a mastery treatment group(!), they claim. The authors refer us to Dunkelberger & Heikkinen, 1984 and Fuchs, Tindal & Fuchs, 1985). The authors then look at 11 studies that both themselves and Slavin consider good, and they find an effect size of around 0.36-0.45 in examiner-made tests, and 0.09 in standardised tests. Seems a good enough agreement.\n\nThey themselves admit:\n\n> Too few studies are available, however, for us to feel confident about these estimates of LFM effect sizes. We would therefore like to see more research on LFM effects, especially its effects on standardized tests.\n>\n> Until more studies are conducted, researchers should keep in mind the current results: LFM students clearly do better than other students on tests developed to fit local curricula, and they do only slightly better than others on standardized tests that sample objectives from many school systems and many grade levels. There is no evidence to suggest that LFM has any negative effects on any type of student learning.\n>\n> Finally, teachers and researchers can learn much more about mastery learning by looking at the full picture rather than the small corner of the research on which Slavin focuses. They can find more stable and reliable estimates of effect sizes in the larger literature on mastery learning. And they can learn about affective and behavioral outcomes of mastery learning; about the conditions under which mastery teaching has stronger and weaker effects; about the students in a classroom who are most affected by a switch to mastery methods; and so on. We believe LFM effects on precollege examinations constitute only a small part of the story.\n\nNow, after reviewing this and having read the debate, what Guskey says in his review from 2015 sounds grossly unfair with Slavin's review:\n\n> A close inspection of this review shows, however, that it was conducted using techniques of questionable validity (Hiebert, 1987), employed capricious selection criteria (Kulik et al., 1990b), reported results in a biased manner (Bloom, 1987; Walberg, 1988), and drew conclusions not substantiated by the evidence presented (Guskey, 1987, 1988). Most importantly, three much more extensive and methodologically sound reviews published since (Guskey and Pigott, 1988; Kulik et al., 1990a; Miles, 2010) have verified mastery learning’s consistently positive impact on a broad range of student learning outcomes and, in one case (i.e., Kulik et al., 1990b), showed clearly the distorted nature of this earlier report.\n\nIf you want to keep reading more about the history of this literature, and the weaknesses of the earlier meta-analyses, section 2 of Evans ([2018](https://scholars.unh.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3383&context=dissertation)) is for you.\n\n## Sample sizes\n\nWhat are the sample sizes in the Kulik meta-analysis? The paper itself doesn't say. But a study of _group-based_ mastery learning by Guskey & Pigott ([1988](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00220671.1988.10885824)) does provide the sample sizes. Most of the studies have samples under 100; but the largest studies (~200 and ~400 students per group) still find large (0.5 and 1 for the largest) effects. (The larges of them is the Cabezon study in Chile I discussed above). The authors note the low quality and heterogeneity of the literature.\n\n> Another factor that may contribute to variation in the magnitude of the effects is lack of precision in specifying the treatment or the fidelity of the treatment.\n>\n> Much confusion exists about what actually constitutes mastery learning, and survey data indicate there is great variability in programs labeled \"mastery learning\" (Jones, Rowman, & Burns, 1986). Without detailed information about the instructional format, the characteristics of the feedback and corrective activities offered to students, and the specific procedures used to evaluate student learning, it is difficult to judge how closely an intervention replicates the ideas of Bloom (1968). Many studies also failed to describe adequately the conditions of the non-mastery control group. The diverse nature of the programs and treatments considered in these studies undoubtedly contributes to the variation in study effects.\n\nA substantial chunk of this literature is also PhD thesis, and conference papers. That's not necessarily a bad thing, but it's an interesting curiosity; I've never went into a literature that looked like this!\n\n## Newer studies\n\nAll these metas are looking at old studies, we can look at some of the new work to see if the effects persist.\n\nJerrim et al. ([2015](https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED581187.pdf)) studied a mastery program for mathematics for Year 7 (Equivalent to grade 7) in London, with a sample of over 5000 students. No significant effects were found (d=.06), and this was an RCT. But then, this trial did not test the same thing the old studies were testing:\n\n> It is important to note that the Mathematics Mastery programme differs from some examples of mastery learning previously studied. For example, a key feature of many apparently effective programmes studied to date was that once pupils have completed each block of content they must demonstrate a high level of success on a test, typically at about the 80% level. Pupils not meeting this target would receive additional instruction, while those who succeeded would engage in enrichment activity that sought to deepen their understanding of the same topic. This is a different approach to that adopted by the Mathematics Mastery programme, within which the developers sought to provide all pupils with “opportunities to deepen understanding through enrichment throughout their time studying the content”.\n>\n> In Mathematics Mastery, the class spent longer than usual on each concept or procedure the first time they studied it, but they did not significantly delay the starting of new topics in the event that some pupils were still unable to achieve mastery. Rather, the intention was that the majority would achieve a good understanding of the key ideas in the required time, and that intervention would be provided for any pupils at risk of falling behind.\n\nVignoles et al. ([2015](https://dera.ioe.ac.uk/29369/1/EEF_Project_Report_MathematicsMasteryPrimary.pdf)) got similar results, when looking at Year 1/Kindergarten, as part of the same study.\n\nKalia ([2005](https://www.it.iitb.ac.in/~vijaya/ticet/dokuwiki/media/inquiry-training-science.pdf)) did a far smaller study in India, with only 30 students per group (90 total), testing a baseline vs mastery learning vs other learning approach. An effect size of 1.64 was found. It does not strike me as a solid study.\n\nMiles ([2010](https://search.proquest.com/openview/df5f682dc189547fde231650b1e7c124/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=18750&diss=y)) in his doctoral dissertation found a d=0.53 effect, but again on a small sample (43 and 36 students in the control vs treatment group). I couldn't access the original work for this review.\n\n## The evidence for tutoring (and software tutoring)\n\nAfter we have looked into mastery learning, we may as well look into tutoring. After all, it is what in Bloom's study got the best results.\n\nThe first thing to note here is that the tutored students in Bloom's Two Sigma paper were not just tutored, they were tutored to help them follow _mastery learning_. And not only that, according to [VanLehn (2011)](http://www.public.asu.edu/~kvanlehn/Stringent/PDF/EffectivenessOfTutoring_Vanlehn.pdf), the standards to which the students were held varied: tutored students were held to higher standards. VanLehn more broadly looks at the relative efficacy of two kinds of computer aided systems, and human tutoring, relative to no tutoring at all.\n\nOne might posit that tutoring works because the tutors are able to gauge how competent students are, what their weaknesses are; and in general form a model of how the student learns so that they can be better guided in their study. But VanLehn is sceptical that this is the reason[4](https://nintil.com/#sceptical):\n\n> Although human tutors usually know which correct knowledge components their tutees had not yet mastered, **the tutors rarely know about their tutees’ misconceptions, false beliefs, and buggy skills** (M. T. H. Chi, Siler, & Jeong, 2004; Jeong, Siler, Chi, 1997; Putnam, 1987). Moreover, human tutors rarely ask questions that could diagnose specific student misconceptions (McArthur, Stasz, & Zmuidzinas, 1990; Putnam, 1987).\n>\n> When human tutors were given mastery/nonmastery information about their tutees, their behavior changed, and they may become more effective (Wittwer, Nuckles, Landmann, & Renkl, 2010). However, they do not change their behavior or become more effective when they are given detailed diagnostic information about their tutee’s misconceptions, bugs, and false beliefs (Sleeman, Kelly, Martinak, Ward, & Moore, 1989).\n>\n> Moreover, in one study, when human tutors simply worked with the same student for an extended period and could thus diagnosis their tutee’s strengths, weaknesses, preferences, and so on, they were not more effective than when they rotated among tutees and thus never had much familiarity with their tutees (Siler, 2004). **In short, human tutors do not seem to infer an assessment of their tutee that includes misconceptions, bugs, or false beliefs, nor do they seem to be able to use such an assessment when it is given to them**\n\nIs this representative of the best tutoring can do? Hardly.\n\nVanLehn looks at other possibilities: Maybe tutors use sophisticated teaching techniques; maybe they select tasks in an highly individual way for each student, maybe they are able to enrich their explanations with general domain knowledge, maybe tutors act as a motivational aid, but he found they typically don't, or when they do, they don't have an effect on the desired outcome that is being measured).\n\nWhat he finds plausible as an explanation is that\n\n1.  Tutors give _feedback_ when student make mistakes, asking students to explain why they do what they do, and spotting the misguided assumptions or concepts.\n2.  Tutors guide students reasoning by asking them relevant questions about what they currently think. VanLehn gives a brief example of a student answering \"What falls faster, a golf ball, or a feather, in vacuum\"; the student gives the right answer, but a subpar reason (The student saw a video of it), and the teacher accepts the answer, but asks why, eventually leading the student to a better explanation. Unlike feedback, this is meant to be proactive.\n3.  Tutors regulate the frequency of student behaviours; nudging them to be more active or interactive in the ways they learn; in turn by hypothesis these kinds of activities support better learning. For example, a student might just sit on a lecture; a tutor might encourage the student to take notes, read more about the subject being discussed, or ask questions when they don't understand.\n\nVanLehn then looks at a few (low-sample size) cases (teaching cardiovascular physiology to medical students, or basic physics), where students without tutoring were compared with students tutored by software and tutored by human tutors: Tutoring is shown to be highly effective, but human tutoring did not prove to be superior to the software-based approach.\n\nThen he looks at the broader literature. **The average effect from tutoring seems[5](https://nintil.com/#poortut) to be _only_ d=0.79**, (This is not quite 2-sigma, but it is a HUGE effect nonetheless); a similar effect was found for good quality software based tutors. What makes software good quality is that it is able to provide feedback at a very granular and concrete level, but after a certain point, he finds, there is a plateau and more finer-grain explanation do not improve learning.\n\nVanLehn is aware this is not quite what Bloom found, so he looks into possible reasons as to why. Could it be that tutoring expertise makes another sigma difference? No, studies don't find substantial effects from tutoring expertise. He then looks at the two studies that found the two sigma gains and why that might have been. The tutors in those studies were not particularly skilled, and as mentioned at the start of this section, the tutored students were tutored using a particularly strict version of mastery learning.\n\nAnother study he looks at was later on replicated, but the replication found a smaller (d=0.52) effect size. The next largest effect size found in the literature is 0.82. Most of these studies are fairly small sample size, so high variance is to be expected. Also, he notes that the studies may not be representative of all tutors. Maybe there are really good tutors out there that are not being measured here. Also, going meta, VanLehn speculates that the reason human tutoring was not found to be better than good software assisted tutoring is that regular tutors do not practice their skills deliberately, they don't get much feedback from their students over time.\n\n> Bloom’s d = 2.0 effect size seems to be due mostly to holding the tutees to a higher standard of mastery. That is, the tutees had to score 90% on a mastery exam before being allowed to continue to the next unit, whereas students in the mastery learning classroom condition had to score 80% on the same exam, and students in the classroom control took the exams but always went on to the next unit regardless of their scores. So the Bloom (1984) article is, as Bloom intended it to be, a demonstration of the power of mastery learning rather than a demonstration of the effectiveness of human tutoring.\n\nMore recent work ([Ma et al., 2014](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Intelligent-Tutoring-Systems-and-Learning-Outcomes%3A-Ma-Adesope/9581009c34216cac062888c5ccf055453db17881)) has also found that this overall result: tutoring is as good as software-based approaches; if anything the effect sizes are smaller (g=0.4)[6](https://nintil.com/#hedges), and there seem to be no publication bias. Focusing on a particular field, computer science, [Nesbit et al. (2014)](https://www.computer.org/csdl/proceedings-article/icalt/2014/4038a099/12OmNBUAvYf) find large effects of software tutoring (d=0.67) relative to regular classrooms. Note that they also find an even larger effect for good quality software tutoring vs very basic computer based instruction (d=0.89). Coursera would be an example of a very basic system in this typology. Other meta-analysis( [Steenbergen-Hu & Cooper, 2014](https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/37750661.pdf) ) focusing on college students have found that human tutors do outperform, contrary to VanLehn, but when disaggregating by software quality (what they dub substep vs step-based tutoring), the findings are again coherent with VanLehn.\n\nAnother meta-analysis, [Kulik & Fletcher (2017)](https://apps.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/1030353.pdf) targets mostly students above grade 6 [(Fletcher, 2018)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6310401/), showing that even for older students and more complex subjects there are still gains from using software tutors. In fact, the effects from software tutoring are markedly larger for post-secondary instruction compared to elementary and secondary levels (Effect sizes 0.44 vs 0.75). Fletcher also stresses that for simpler learning scenarios, as those found in pre-university education, \"drill and practice \" systems like DI work fine, at a lower cost.\n\nThe one case so far where there seems to be a larger effect is in the DARPA Digital Tutor case; developed to train US Navy information system technicians. A 16 week software based course was compared to 35 weeks of a regular classroom course. Effect sizes ranges from 1.97 to 3.18(!) in the two evaluations reported in Kulik's meta-analysis. **The students even outperformed the instructors!**\n\n## DARPA's study\n\nThis section is a summary of the following reports: [Fletcher & Morrison (2012)](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5cf7de352936000001a3add5/t/5d1a7f8a56c171000152f29c/1562017675908/D4686-DF.pdf), and[Fletcher & Morrison (2014)](https://apps.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/1002362.pdf) .\n\nIn 2010 there were two trials of DARPA's sponsored Digital Tutor (DT) for the Navy, in April (4 weeks of DT training) and in November (8 weeks), overseen by an external party, the Institute for Defense Analyses (IDA). The design was an RCT, where they also measured IQ (AFQT) in the control and experimental groups to make sure they were roughly similar (And they were)\n\n- In the April trial, the assessment was a written knowledge test, where the DT students (20) outperformed regularly taught students (18) (the regular course goes on for 10 weeks, d=2.81) and also the _instructors (13) of the regular course_ (d=1.25). (Numbers in bracket indicate the sample size for each group). The test questions were in part provided by the DT developer (93 items), the instructors (51 preexisting questions+25 new ones), and IDA (5). Before administering the test, it was judged by four IT support staff from IDA as a good measure of IT admin knowledge.\n- In the November trial they had four groups: students taught for 7 weeks with DT (20), one regularly taught group (18) as before, one group (20) taught for ~10 weeks in a different but related course, IT of the Future( IToF) and the instructors for the regular course(10). As before, they used a written test, but they also included a practical examination, and an oral exam for a third of randomly selected DT and IToF students. Again, DT students outscored everyone else: the instructors (d=1.35) in the knowledge test, the IToF students in the practical exam (d=1.9), the regular students in the written test (d=4.68), and the oral reviews (d=1.34).\n\nWith effect sizes this large, measured in so many different ways, maybe DARPA has solved Bloom's two sigma already! Also, unlike with mastery learning, the DT students were taught in less than half the time as everyone else! One can surely argue that the larger effects in the knowledge tests were due to the fact that a lot of the questions were provided by the DT developer, and the same was the case for the practical examinations. But it was not the case for the oral examinations, and even then the tests were externally reviewed and considered fair, so while we can assume a part of those large effect sizes are due to a better fit between the test and what was taught with DT, there still seems to be a legitimate improvement.\n\nOne might argue that we should disregard the low sample size study here, but I argue that we should take it seriously. First, if one expects an effect of d=1, and one wants a [statistical power of 80%](https://www.ai-therapy.com/psychology-statistics/sample-size-calculator), the sample size is about 17 subjects per group, around what DARPA had. Second, it was not just one test, but a few, all showing large effects. Third, there were three trials (The test run in 2009 and the full runs in 2010), and all results were reported. And fourth, each trial is composed of many questions, over a hundred in the case of the knowledge test, one can get lucky in one, but that's far less likely in a comprehensive assessment.\n\nGiven the results, there was a next stage test with a 16 week DT course compared to a 35 week course, and to another group of skilled (9 years of experience on average) technicians. Again the samples were small, but the effect sizes are still there: DT students outperformed the technicians (d=0.85) and regular students (remember, they studied for twice the time!) (d=1.13) in practical tests, and similar magnitudes were observed for the oral examinations.\n\nAll in all, this is really good evidence for the possibilities of software-based tutoring; as they not only tested theoretical skill, but also applied knowledge, in a varied number of ways.\n\n## Making good software for tutoring is hard\n\nA common theme in the studies cited above is comparing [advanced](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_tutoring_system) vs simplistic computer based tutoring. Making good software tutors is hard, and it would be a long review of its own to properly look at tutoring software[7](https://nintil.com/#ssctutor).\n\nHere's a review (Alkhatlan & Kalita, [2018](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.09628.pdf)) of how ITS's look like from a design point of view. The authors also mention that the best human tutors outperform the best software. I would be surprised if this were not the case. This adds some nuance to VanLehn's review: Yes it may be that the average tutor performs on par with the average of the best software, but the best of tutors perform even beyond what software can do. It's easy to imagine, as a star tutor could also easily assign students a software tutor, and supplement that with other activities.\n\nAndy Matuschak (personal communication) suggested that the key difficulty is that one needs both to be a good creative problem solver, and have domain knowledge in order to translate knowledge and explanations into good software. Many are developed by PhD students and then abandoned. Even the DARPA tutor doesn't seem to have been put into production yet, for some reason.\n\n## Looking at other fields\n\nHaving completed the review of the core topics of this essay, it is worth looking at other fields that are related but seem to be in a better shape in terms of evidence behind them to see what should we expect. After all, if we knew that no other educational intervention has an effect size above 0.1, it would be unlikely that the ones under consideration are all that special. In effect, this section tries to put what I've already discussed in context.\n\n## The reliability of educational research in general\n\nKnowing the state of the educational research field in general gives us some prior expectation for what would happen if we had proper large sample RCTs for the methods being examined. If we knew nothing about ML, we should expect it to have a very small positive effect, as this is the average effect found by Hugues & Matthew ([2019](http://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/141754/)), who argue that most large scale educational RCTs are often uninformative\n\nWhat does _uninformative_ mean here? The authors dub a study uninformative if _its findings are consistent with the associated intervention being either effective or ineffective. Whether or not an RCT is informative in these terms therefore depends upon both its effect size and the precision with which that effect size is estimated._\n\nThey review 190 RCTs they deem to be high quality conducted prior June 2018 that targeted K-12 students and measured some quantitative metric of academic nature (e.g. test scores). The average effect size is 0.06 and highly heterogeneous, but there is no sub-analysis that reveals particularly stronger effects on average; also the confidence intervals were large. When an effect size is, say, 0.06 +/- 0.3, what is one to think?\n\nThe authors consider that this result, finding an effect size smaller than those found in individual studies for the different methods may be due to an unreliable literature, the interventions being legitimately ineffective, or the interventions being poorly designed so that they can't detect a hypothetical true effect: the educational methods being deployed could not be as good as the ones tested in labs. As with most research, the authors conclude that there should be more research into explaining why this is the case.\n\nIn this work, the Jerrim et al. ([2015](https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED581187.pdf)) paper I discussed above was mentioned, and it is the closest to what concerns us in the present literature review; the others do not seem to be either about direct instruction or mastery learning.\n\nWhat works, according to this large review of RCTs? I provide below the effect sizes, evidence quality assessments and Bayes Factors for the top interventions.[8](https://nintil.com/#bayes)\n\n- \"Improving Writing Quality\", aimed at improving the writing skills of struggling students, involving providing kids with [guidelines](https://www.understood.org/en/school-learning/learning-at-home/encouraging-reading-writing/6-strategies-to-teach-kids-self-regulation-in-writing) of what good writing looks like and how they should approach the process of writing (d=.74, strength of evidence judged as 2/5,Bayes Factor(BF)=10.52)\n- \"Butterfly Phonics\", aimed at improving the reading skills of struggling students, which involves small (6-8 students) groups, and constant feedback through the class. (d=.43, strength of evidence judged as 0/5, BF=3.6)\n- \"Access to Algebra I\", aimed at improving performance in algebra in grade 8 at-risk students, using a web-based course (d=.4), BF=154\n- \"One to one coaching\", aimed at improving reading and writing skills of kids with low levels of attainment in English (d=.36, strength of evidence judged as 3/5, BF=4587)\n\nThese target students that are at risk, as with the Direct Instruction literature, and the effect sizes are around what the DI literature also finds, if we take it at face value.\n\nCheung & Slavin ([2016](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.3102/0013189X16656615?journalCode=edra)) studied what features of studies correlate with effect size, in general. The two largest factors influencing the results are sample size, and the kind of test that is used to measure performance:\n\n- Sample size: Low sample size (<100) studies find an average effect of .38, large samples (>2000) find .11\n- Measurement type: Studies using measures designed by the experimenters find larger effect sizes (0.4) compared to studies using independent measures (0.2)\n- Design: Randomized studies find an effect of 0.16 on average, quasirandomized studies find 0.23 on average.\n- Publication status: Published studies find an effect of 0.3, unpublished studies find .16.\n\n## The possibility of improvement through deliberate practice\n\nDeliberate practice -or practising something \"properly\" for extended periods of time - is also a related field that we can look at to better understand what expectations should we have for tutoring and mastery learning.\n\nThe most recent meta-analysis of deliberate practice and its impact on a range of fields (Macnamara et al., [2014](https://scottbarrykaufman.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Macnamara-et-al.-2014.pdf)) indicates that, relative to games, music or sports, where practice is somewhat associated with better performance (18-26% of variance explained), in education this number falls to 4%. A later meta-analysis looking at sports exclusively finds similar results (Macnamara et al., [2016](https://www.drjimtaylor.com/4.0/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Deliberate-Practice-and-Elite-Sports-Performance.pdf)). When looking only at professional athletes, cumulative deliberate practice explains only 1% of the variance in performance, presumably because there are decreasing marginal gains to deliberate practice and at that point, genetic endowments is what differentiates those elite athletes. If everyone is training hard, there are only so many hours in a day one can train for. There was also no correlation between the age at which athletes started training and performance. For internally paced (darts) vs externally paced (volleyball) sports, deliberate practice seems to work substantially better for the former (41% of variance explained), which makes sense to me, as there is less randomness, but did not reach significance in the meta-analysis (p=0.08).\n\n> in a study of field hockey players included in the present meta-analysis, Güllich (2014) found a nonsignificant difference in accumulated deliberate practice hours between Olympic gold medallists (M = 3,556, SD = 1,134) and field hockey players who played in the first four divisions for their country but who had not achieved international success (M = 4,118, SD = 807). Similarly, in a study of swimmers included in the present meta-analysis, Johnson, Tenenbaum, and Edmonds (2006) found a nonsignificant difference in accumulated deliberate practice hours between highly accomplished swimmers (M = 7,129, SD = 2,604) and swimmers who had not yet achieved similar accomplishments (M = 7,819, SD = 2,209).\n\nWhat about chess? Are Grandmasters good because they practice or because they were born with skills that are well suited for chess? At least for the case of intelligence, the correlation doesn't seem to go beyond r=0.35 in a meta-analysis of amateur and skilled players with ELOs between 1311 and 2607 (Burgoyne et al., [2016](https://www.psychologie.uzh.ch/dam/jcr:4b13cd49-3e58-409f-988e-1e73693e1e0b/Burgoyne.Intelligence.2016.pdf)), this implies a variance explained (R^2) of around 6%. If we look only at professionals, the correlation is smaller, 0.14 This **does not mean the other 94% is explained by practice**. Indeed, if we look at heritability more broadly, for chess skill it may be around 48% (Vinkhuyzen et al., [2009](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2688647/) ) .\n\nWhat's the impact, then, of deliberate practice? There is one paper (Burgoyne & Nye, [2019](https://artscimedia.case.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/141/2019/03/18150415/Burgoyne-et-al.-2019.pdf)) that looks at it in a sample of moderately to highly skilled chess players (ELOs between 1150 to 2650) and we get that it accounts for 34%. Note that this doesn't mean that deliberate practice doesn't matter for novices! Indeed, for novices practice is almost all there is. Higher intelligence or better memory may give players the ability to better evaluate a board, but practice gives players the ability to do a such evaluations to begin with! It is only when one has moved past the novice stage when the effects from innate skills will begin to appear.\n\nEricsson ([2016](https://scottbarrykaufman.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Ericsson-2016-commentary.pdf)) who does think that deliberate practice matter greatly thinks that Macnamara et al. overreached in their definition of deliberate practice; Ericsson argues that only a very special kind of practice should count, concretely practice that has been designed and/or implemented with the help of, a coach or teacher.\n\nOne on one coaching for national and international-level athletes is suggested by Ericsson as one clear example: He says there is a high (>0.8) correlation between time spent with a coach and performance; the studies he bases his estimates off were not in the Macnamara et al. meta-analysis. Also, Macnamara et al.'s counted as valid subjective measures of performance, while Ericsson would rather have purely objective measures. Ericsson goes as far as claiming that no genes have been identified that account for differences in individual performance, something which is [clearly false](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3993978/), especially for intellectually demanding tasks. Even if no genes were identified, the fact that heritability of sport performance is far from negligible suggests that there is a strong case for a genetic basis for achievement, even when concrete genes cannot be identified yet.\n\nMacnamara et al. ([2016](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/0535/68b8fc30d7fb4f6d3de2ee66b83eb20b874d.pdf)) reply to Ericsson that first, he himself has used non-objective measures in his studies on deliberate practice, and that second, in his work he hasn't restricted his definition of deliberate practice to the narrow definition Ericsson wants them to use. Even then, Macnamara et al. did look at a breakdown by measure type, and indeed objective measures do show a somewhat stronger effect from deliberate practice, but still under 25% of total variance explained in performance.\n\nFinally, in a broader look at the literatures on cognitive performance improvement (They look at grit, growth mindset, brain training, deliberate practice, and bilingualism) Moreau, Macnamara & Hambrick ([2018](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Brooke_Macnamara2/publication/329055215_Overstating_the_Role_of_Environmental_Factors_in_Success_A_Cautionary_Note/links/5bf9825b458515a69e387608/Overstating-the-Role-of-Environmental-Factors-in-Success-A-Cautionary-Note.pdf)) find no evidence that these practices do anything to improve performance, in any way defined, except for deliberate practice, that does improves individual performance in some cases, **but that it does not explain large differences found between individuals** _at a professional level_.\n\n## The possibility of improvement through spaced repetition\n\nIf the above seems a bit pessimistic, saying that practice doesn't matter, the literature on spaced repetition says the opposite. As reviewed by Gwern[9](https://nintil.com/#srs), the effect size of spaced learning vs massed learning (or cramming) is d=0.42 (Or perhaps a bit less), and has been found across a range of domains. Note that this is not an effect size of spaced repetition vs not studying again at all. If we asked someone to memorize a set of new, hard to remember, facts in a week, and someone else to use spaced repetition to keep that fresh over a year, at the end of that year, the effect size would be massive, as the first person may as well have forgotten it all while the second has kept it fresh.\n\n## Why would mastery learning work? Some proposed experiments\n\nSuppose that something by the name \"The Incredible Learning Method\" or TILM has been shown to increase performance by d=0.5. One then wonders what TILM is. TILM consists on doing spaced repetition and doing pushups every day.\n\nShould we then recommend that kids do pushups if they want to learn? Or should we find what, ultimately, causes TILM to work?\n\nIn this approach, we break down a method into its components and experiment with them separately, or together by parts, seeing what effects we find. Then, we could try to study how each of the subcomponents behaves in other samples, or try to find neuroscience-level explanations for them.\n\nFor spaced repetition, the answer here would be the underlying idea of there being a [forgetting curve](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0120644) which in turn might be possible to explain by some feature of how the brain works at a low level.\n\nIn fact, could it be that mastery learning is spaced repetition in disguise?\n\nOr, it could also be that the thing doing the trick is just more time: If we assume that the more exposed one is to a concept more one learns it (with perhaps some plateau at the end), then the fact that a student keeps studying over and over the same material would increase performance. If so, mastery learning wouldn't have an effect if one controls for time invested in instruction. As Slavin puts it:\n\n> In an extreme form, the central contentions of mastery learning theory are almost tautologically true. If we establish a reasonable set of learning objectives and demand that every student achieve them at a high level regardless of how long that takes, then it is virtually certain that all students will ultimately achieve that criterion.\n\nOr, it could also be that it is just the testing that is doing the work. Recall, mastery learning is a study-test-feedback-corrective loop. Slavin found that the study-test-feedback loop works almost as well. But we also know that study-test also works! This is known as the [testing effect](https://www.gwern.net/Spaced-repetition#background-testing-works).\n\nOr, it could also be that mastering lesson N does have an impact on better absorbing the knowledge in lessons N+i. If so, a way to study this would be teaching a group with mastery learning and another with regular methods one lesson, then teaching both groups with regular methods lesson 2. If mastery learning works, then the group of students that originally was taught with mastery learning should get better results. This is, it seems to me, the only genuine \"mastery\" effect.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nBloom noted that mastery learning had an effect size of around 1 (one sigma); while tutoring leads to d=2. This is mostly an outlier case.\n\nNonetheless, Bloom was on to something: Tutoring and mastery learning do have a degree of experimental support, and fortunately it seems that carefully designed software systems can completely replace the instructional side of traditional teaching, achieving better results, on par with one to one tutoring. However, designing them is a hard endeavour, and there is a motivational component of teachers that may not be as easily replicable purely by software.\n\nOverall, it's good news that the effects are present for younger and older students, and across subjects, but the effect sizes of tutoring, mastery learning or DI are not as good as they would seem from Bloom's paper. That said, it is true that tutoring does have large effect sizes, and that properly designed software does as well. The DARPA case study shows what is possible with software tutoring, in the case the effect sizes went even beyond Bloom's paper.\n\nAlso, other approaches to education also have shown large effect sizes, and so one shouldn't privilege DI/ML here. The principles behind DI/ML (clarity in what is taught, constant testing, feedback, remediation) are sound, and they do seem more clearly effective for disadvantaged children, so for them they are worth trying. For gifted children, or in general intelligent individuals, the principles of the approaches do still make sense, but how much of an effect do they have? In this review I have not looked at this question, but suffice to say that I haven't found numerous mentions of work targeting the gifted.\n\nThat aside, if what one has in mind is raising the average societal skill-level by improving education, that's a different matter, and that's where the evidence from the DI literature is less compelling. The effects that do seem to emerge are weaker, perhaps of a quarter of a standard deviation at best. ML does fare better in the general student population, and for college students too.\n\nAs for the effect of diverse variables on the effects, studies tend to find that the effects of DI/ML fade over time -but don't fully disappear-, that less skilled students benefit more than highly capable ones, and the effects vary greatly on what is being tested. Mastery learning, it seems, works by overfitting to a test, and the chances that those skills do not generalise are nontrivial. As in Direct Instruction, if what is desired is mastery of a few key core concepts, especially with children with learning disabilities, it may be well suited for them. But it is yet unclear if DI are useful for average kids. For high SES kids, it seems unlikely that they would benefit.\n\nThe history of the educational research literature is one plagued with low quality small sample size studies that were done decades ago, with less work being done now. It can be that now researchers are focusing on studying other instructional methods. Still, the fact that most large RCTs tend to find little effects should make us have a sceptical prior when presented with a new educational method.\n\n## Coda: What should you learn?\n\nI have been discussing above learning methods. But what about learning content? What should one learn? Bryan Caplan, in his book _The Case Against Education_[10](https://nintil.com/#caplan) argues that skills are not very transferable: you get good at what you do, and you quickly forget everything else. This informed my priors when looking at the mastery learning literature; and so I was not that surprised to find the issue with the kinds of tests I outlined in my section on Slavin.\n\nCaplan is right, and this opens an avenue to improve teaching: Suppose you focus on the very basics that will most likely be useful to the students in the future (reading, writing, mathematics). With the time freed up from not teaching other subjects, one can both help disadvantaged students get good at those core topics, and let non-disadvantaged students use the extra time to learn about whatever they want. I would even suggest let them go home, but it may be argued one of the implicit roles of school is that of a place to keep the kids while the parents are working, a kindergarten for older children, but if parents are okay letting their kids roam around, and cities are safe, this is not an issue. Definitely worth exploring.\n\nGranting that one can use DI to hammer down very basic points, should one also hammer down History and English Literature? Just because you can make the learning of those happen doesn't mean that you should: the effectiveness of an intervention also depends on the values being used to judge it. What's the effect size of removing History from the curriculum and leaving more time for the kids to play?\n\n## Questions\n\n1.  Why aren't these methods more commonplace? I can understand that tutoring is expensive, but developing high quality software for tutoring is a one-off expenditure. Especially for large-scale public systems, it should be easy for them to fund it. Mastery learning doesn't seem that expensive to implement either. A place to start, for the case of Direct Instruction, is McCullen & Madelaine ([2014](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/19404158.2014.962065?journalCode=rald20))\n2.  How much do teachers matter, as an overall question, without focusing on particular methodologies. SSC [says](https://slatestarcodex.com/2016/05/19/teachers-much-more-than-you-wanted-to-know/) not much. Indeed, some recent work suggests that students are almost as good professors as professors themselves in a university setting (Feld et al., [2019](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0272775719300767))\n3.  How well does grouping students by ability (tracking/ability grouping) work. Again, [SSC](https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/09/04/acc-entry-does-the-education-system-adequately-serve-advanced-students/)\n4.  ~Slavin has his own preferred educational approach, [Success for All](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Success_for_All). Does this work? The effect sizes reported for this seem to be around 0.25, and studies comparing it to DI find similar effects. In fact, DI and ML are explicitly components of SfA, as per Slavin himself. If anything the [evidence](http://www.successforall.org/results/evidence-for-success/) seems better than that of DI, and the effect sizes are more credible.~\n5.  Digging deeper into the specifics of tutoring software\n6.  Pre-university takes a lot of time, over a decade. Can this be compressed in a year?\n7.  What about education for adults? There is a market of education out there for those in the need of various skills (e.g. language). What are the predominant approaches? Do they work?\n8.

I’ve alluded to the concept of “mimetic desire” frequently, but I haven’t dedicated an entire newsletter to explaining it. Here it is.\n\nThis one is less narrative than usual. It’s a bit more academic. With that said, I still tried to make it as engaging as possible without watering anything down.\n\nFor those of you already familiar with mimetic desire, I hope you find a fresh new take here—as well as some fun drawings.\n\nI only cover “Stage 1” mimetic desire in this piece. In my view, covering Stages 1-4 of the mimetic process (which includes rivalry, conflict, violence, the scapegoat mechanism, the cover-up, and the formation of culture) in the same piece is simply overload. Mimetic desire is the foundation of mimetic theory, and it deserves all of the attention for now. I’ll be addressing the other stages separately in due time.\n\nOkay. Let’s get straight to it.\n\n## **What is Mimetic Desire?**\n\nNearly everyone (unconsciously) assumes there’s a straight line between them and the things they want.\n\n> _\\> > I wake up one day and “suddenly” decide that I want to run a marathon—amazingly, all of my friends had a similar realization when they hit their mid-thirties, too._\n>\n> _\\> > I get the brilliant idea that Substack is objectively the best publishing platform for my long-form essay writing, based on all the “data”—right around the time that everyone else and their mother seems to be arriving at the same conclusion._\n>\n> _\\>> I decide to get a dog during Covid because, well, I’ve been wanting a dog for a long time and now seems like as good a time as ever. (Nevermind that I’m the only one in my friend group who hasn’t, yet, and these guys share pictures of their puppies on Instagram along with the rest of the world on nearly a daily basis.)_\n\nIn each of these cases, I’ve convinced myself that my desire is independent and autonomous. I want to pursue something because it “just makes sense,” or it’s the right thing to do, or it’s what I “authentically” desire, my personal pathway to fulfillment.\n\n(This all happens beneath my conscious awareness. Very few people question why they want the things they want at all.)\n\nThe assumption that my desires are all my own—this story that I tell myself—is what the French social scientist René Girard calls “The Romantic Lie.” The Lie is that I want things independently, or that I choose all of the objects of my desire out of some secret desire chamber in my heart. I know a good thing when I see it; I know what’s desirable and what’s not, unaided.\n\n[![The Romantic Lie by René Girard](inbox/assets/The%20Romantic%20Lie%20by%20René%20Girard.png\")](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fef3b977b-c029-4e39-ae9e-447b8b245240_800x312.png)\n\nAll illustrations by Liana Finck. Her work can be found in the New Yorker and on her excellent Instagram page.\n\nJulius Caesar was an excellent Romantic Liar. When he won the battle of Zela, he famously declared: “Veni, vidi, vici” (*I came, I saw, I conquered).* If we translate these words into the language of desire, we see what he is really claiming: “_I came, I **desired**, I conquered.”_\n\nCaesar would like all of us to believe he needs only to lay eyes on something to know whether it’s worth wanting. But Caesar is lying. He’s like the rest of us. The desirability of the particular land on which the battle of Zela was fought had nothing to do with the land itself and everything to do with the value that his rival, the Persian king Pharnaces II, had put on it—simply by being there.1\n\nThe value of objects is not objective—it’s subjective. And that subjective value is determined mimetically, based on our relationships with others. We could say that value is *intersubjective*: we assign value to things (and therefore desire them) according to what other people want.\n\n**Models of desire**—those people who we look to for guidance about what to want (usually without knowing it)—literally transfigure objects before our eyes. Say you walk into a consignment store with a friend and see racks filled with hundreds of shirts. Nothing jumps out at you. But the moment your friend becomes enamored with one specific shirt, it’s no longer a shirt on a rack. It’s now *the* shirt that your friend Molly chose—the Molly who, by the way, is an assistant costume designer on the sets of major films. The moment she starts ogling one shirt, she sets it apart. It’s a different shirt than it was five seconds earlier, before she started wanting it.\n\nAnd it doesn’t have to be a shirt. It can be anything.\n\n[![Novelistic Truth René Girard](inbox/assets/Novelistic%20Truth%20René%20Girard.png\")](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc5439f0e-7a6d-417b-8022-46fbc99bc7d5_776x480.png)\n\nThe path between us and the thing we want is never straight. It’s always curved. It goes through, or around, models.\n\n## Mediated Desire\n\nModels are people, groups, or things that help us know what to want.\n\n“O hell! to choose love by another’s eyes!” says Hermia in Shakespeare’s A Midsummer Night’s Dream. It’s hell to know we have chosen anything by another’s eyes. But we do it all the time: we choose brands, schools, and dishes at a restaurant by them.\n\n[![](/assets/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7f53170c-5fba-498d-9c4f-c7a03b74e2d2_816x612.jpeg..jpeg)](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7f53170c-5fba-498d-9c4f-c7a03b74e2d2_816x612.jpeg)\n\nThe art of Phillip Guston—the inspiration behind our big-eyed faces.\n\nHumans have a built-in, *instinctual* radar for our most basic needs—just like animals do. If we’re trapped outside in the cold freezing, we instinctively seek shelter in the warmth.\n\nBasic survival, sustenance, sex, warmth: these are all instinctual needs for which we have biological mechanisms to help guide us. If I’m starving and I see a juicy steak and a piece of wood in front of me, I don’t need much help to determine which one I should eat. My body tells me what to choose.\n\nThese things are not desires per se*.* It’s more appropriate to call them “needs.”\n\nA **desire**, on the other hand, is an object that we pursue for which there is no purely instinctual basis. When it comes to desire, we don’t have a *built-in* mechanism (like instincts) to help guide us toward wanting one thing more than another. Which new model of car should we buy? What should we major in at college? What style of clothes should we wear? The more abstract the thing is, the more mimetic desire usually comes into play. Our central nervous system certainly isn’t going to give us any clear or intelligible answers.\n\nBut models can. **_Models are people who show us what is worth wanting._**\n\nRather than an internal (biological) homing device that helps us make choices, models are external signposts that steer us toward the pursuit of certain people, places, things, even lifestyles.\n\nModels are like people who *seem* farther up ahead on the path we’re on; they can see around a corner that we can’t see around. We assume that they have some insight into which direction to go that we do not. In short, we assume they have something that we do not—that they possess some quality of being that we do not. And so we follow them.\n\nMimetic desire means that we make many of our choices *according to the desires* of others—our models.\n\n### **The Mimetic Martini**\n\nIf we choose something that nobody else seems to want, we begin to doubt that we made the right choice. If a high school student starts dating a classmate that none of her friends express even the slightest bit of interest in, she grows insecure. She begins to wonder whether she made the right choice. We seek validation in our desires. We look for social proof.\n\nDesire always needs something to latch onto; it can’t stay free-floating. In this sense, it operates like a bivalve that has to be attached to a substrate (a rock, or some other surface). As soon as it becomes detached from one thing, it immediately attaches itself to something else: another model.\n\nThere is no end to desire because there are always more models. The overnight Bitcoin millionaire doesn’t start wanting less, or even simpler things; he starts taking an interest in rare fish aquariums, Nordic cooking, and traveling to obscure places he reads about in his [Monocle](https://monocle.com/magazine/) magazines.\n\nDesire, according to René Girard, is always for something we think we *lack*—or else it wouldn’t be desire at all. Desire is *not object-oriented*, as we commonly assume. Desire never finds fulfillment in any particular “thing.” There is literally no object or achievement or person that would ever satiate our desire. If anything, we dream up new and strange things to want the more that we have.\n\nDesire is unique to humans in this sense. Animals don’t have abilities of abstraction, which means they can’t *want things* beyond their immediate worlds. Humans, on the other hand, have learned to want the most obscure and trivial things. And our mimetic nature has made us a target of manipulation by those who understand how this mechanism works.\n\n[![](/assets/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fccfeaa08-022a-41be-86e6-babd42e0734b_974x400.png..png)](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fccfeaa08-022a-41be-86e6-babd42e0734b_974x400.png)\n\nThis continuum is an oversimplification. In reality, the lines are blurry. Our most basic needs are also driven largely by mimesis.\n\nEven *water* has transitioned from the world of needs to the world of desires. Imagine you came here from another planet that was still in the pre-bottled-water stage of evolution (a critical stage). I asked you whether you preferred Aquafina, Voss, or San Pellegrino. Which would you choose?\n\nSure, I could present you with the minerality breakdown and pH levels of each, but we’d be kidding ourselves if we think that’s how you will make your choice. I tell you I drink San Pellegrino. And if you’re an imitative creature like me, or if you just think I’m a more highly developed being than you—because you come from a pre-Pellegrino people—you’re going to choose San Pellegrino.\n\nIt’s revealing to think of mimetic desire along a continuum. Certain people and organizational cultures are more prone to mimesis than others. And one thing is clear, on a societal level: any society in which people are no longer struggling with scarcity but *coping with abundance* will undergo an explosion of mimetic desire.\n\n[![](/assets/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff1e402f3-2dd2-4eec-bd98-c551bb6ad1cb_974x650.png..png)](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff1e402f3-2dd2-4eec-bd98-c551bb6ad1cb_974x650.png)\n\nIn this universe of desire that we find ourselves in, there is no stable hierarchy. Since desires are determined by models and not by instincts, we can begin to want something new at any given time if the right model comes along. The sociologist and philosopher Zygmunt Bauman referred to this kind of situation as “liquid modernity”—almost nothing is stable. Not least of all our desires.\n\nNone of this is to say that our evaluation of people and things is *merely* subjective. It is (hopefully) formed in part by the objective qualities of the thing itself. A baby banging on pots and pans, a high school punk band, and Mozart have different levels of musicality. *Beauty is objective, but we perceive it subjectively*—that is, mimetically. We perceive it through the lens of models who distort reality. The more we want to be like a model, the more we lose sight of the objective qualities of the things they have.\n\nThe *things themselves* don’t matter much when it comes to desire. We care about people (models), not things. They represent some *quality of being* that we think we lack.\n\nThis is what Girard calls **metaphysical desire**: *desire of another’s desire*—not of any particular object. One way to think about the word metaphysical is “after the physical.” Metaphysical desire is not concerned with physical things. It is concerned with *being* a certain way. It is concerned with identity.\n\n[![](/assets/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6827d33e-7919-4a14-9f0f-0b39c3b28b52_899x899.png..png)](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6827d33e-7919-4a14-9f0f-0b39c3b28b52_899x899.png)\n\nA chef who lusts for the elusive Michelin Guide stars does not want the silly red star that appears next to the name of his restaurant (like a blue verified mark on Twitter…)—he wants the prestige that comes with it. The credentials of universities, having bylines in certain publications, getting named to certain “lists”, or simply just being thought of as an “expert” by others are all forms of this mimetically-driven sense of identity.\n\nI’ll re-iterate in slightly different terms: a model is someone, real or fictional, who *mediates desire* to us. We already call people who mediate desire for certain clothes or styles by their true name: “models.” Their purpose is not to model the physical articles of clothing but the *desire to wear the clothes*. Their purpose is to make us want what they have.\n\nWhat you actually want is their face, their body, their withering stare—which don’t come with the clothes.\n\n## Two Types of Models\n\nThere are two major types of models with whom we have different kinds of relationships. Mimetic desire works differently in each of the two situations.\n\nIf the model stands at a great distance—not physically, but socially and existentially—then the model is an *external mediator* of desire. The model is external to the subject’s world. This means that no serious competition with the model is possible.\n\nI like to call the world in which these types of models live **Celebristan**for short.\n\n[![](/assets/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0739cf9b-7c7d-41cf-9fe0-8db5199fc5c0_836x952.png..png)](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0739cf9b-7c7d-41cf-9fe0-8db5199fc5c0_836x952.png)\n\nThere is a barrier between the models in Celebristan and the people who take them as models. That barrier can be death, or time, or space, or simply status.\n\nWhile everybody likes a feel-good story of a movie star or singer taking a high schooler to the prom, we all know that the high schooler isn’t on a real date—he or she has no chance of competing with the movie star’s real suitors. They live in Celebristan.\n\nDon’t get me wrong. I don’t mean that a person *literally* has to be a celebrity to exist in this world. I am referring to situations where a person is simply an *external mediator of desire—*their desires cannot be directly challenged by their imitator because they seem to occupy a different plane of existence. Even the growing gap between rich and poor in the United States can put neighbors in the awkward situation of one person living in Celebristan while the other does not. (And that’s a recipe for resentment—and more.)\n\nIn the greatest novel ever written—Cervantes’ *Don Quixote—*the protagonist Don Quixote has his desire inflamed to be a knight (more specifically: a “knight errant”) merely by reading about the adventures of the famous knight Amadís de Gaula. The chivalrous knight, Amadís, was completely external to Don Quixote’s world. He existed in Celebristan.\n\nDon Quixote sets out on his crazy adventure with his trusty sidekick, Sancho Panza. But even though they are side-by-side through much of the book, Don Quixote is still an external mediator of desire for Sancho Panza. They are separated by social class and their sense of identity. At no point in the novel does Sancho believe he is a serious competitor to Don Quixote—he doesn’t even dream about wanting or achieving the same things that Don Quixote does—even though they occupy the same physical space and time.\n\nWe all have people who are in Celebristan from our perspective. A Managing Director at an investment bank lives in Celebristan to an Analyst (an entry-level position); NBA players do to college players (college athletes can’t compete for the same championship and trophy); even a much older brother can seem to be in Celebristan to his younger brother. At least until they both make it through adolescence and the older brother doesn’t seem more like a man than a peer in the younger boy’s eyes.\n\nIt’s worth asking ourselves, honestly: Who in my life do I look at as if they live in Celebristan?\n\n## Freshmanistan\n\nThe other kind of model is an *internal mediator of desire*—one who mediates desire from inside the subject’s world. I like to call this world **Freshmanistan** for short.\n\nRemember what it’s like to be a freshman in high school or college? Despite the “great differences” between the jocks and the nerds and the Thespians, they’re all far more alike than they are different: they sit next to one another in the same classes, they’re all roughly the same age, and they’re all vying to carve out an adult identity. None of them have that much power or money (I’m not counting mommy and daddy’s). They’re all, so to speak, in the same boat—as much as they try to deny it.\n\nMost importantly, there is no barrier separating them from one another. They are in a situation where competition over anything and everything is possible.\n\n[![](/assets/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe9bc8ca3-f21d-495a-b79f-d969967e284b_974x422.png..png)](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe9bc8ca3-f21d-495a-b79f-d969967e284b_974x422.png)\n\n\\[Note: a model’s location in either Celebristan or Freshmanistan is always *relative* to the other person. The rapper Kanye West is in Celebristan to me—but he’s not to Jay-Z. The two of them exist in Freshmanistan together because they have a relationship in which real competition is possible.\\]\n\nIf you lived in 1954 and had 100 students in your class, that would be your Freshmenistan. In 2021, if you’re in a class with 100 students, your Freshmenistan is those 100 kids plus every other freshman you follow on Instagram, TikTok, and Snapchat. That’s a lot of modeling, comparing, and desire-shifting.\n\nIn Freshmanistan, things can get messy very fast. And all social media is Freshmanistan—we are surrounded by models of desire at all times.\n\n[![](/assets/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbab11687-5d70-498b-a030-312fdfaed2b9_974x974.png..png)](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbab11687-5d70-498b-a030-312fdfaed2b9_974x974.png)\n\nIn a way, we’re all Freshmen again. Freshmanistan is characterized by a dangerous level of *sameness*, which leads to a crisis of undifferentiation—even as everyone is imitating their secret models, whom they profess to love (but secretly hate), they are desperately trying to carve out their own identities on a tiny raft, in the middle of stormy waters that threaten to swallow them up in a sea of sameness.\n\nGo ahead, differentiate yourself. You have 180 characters.\n\nUntil next time,  \nLuke\n\n**\\>> [Continue with Part II](https://read.lukeburgis.com/p/mimetic-desire-102-mimes-memes) of this series on Mimetic Desire.**\n\n###### **1 The example of Julius Caesar as an excellent Romantic Liar is inspired by work of James Warren, who includes this anecdote in his excellent book,** **_[Compassion or Apocalypse: A Comprehensible Guide to the Thought of René Girard](https://www.amazon.com/Compassion-Apocalypse-Comprehensible-Thought-Girard-ebook/dp/B00CPL2N0M/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=girard+compassion&qid=1610564328&s=books&sr=1-1)._**\n","n":0.019}}},{"i":549,"$":{"0":{"v":"Mental Bondage In The Name Of God","n":0.378},"1":{"v":"\n[Mental Bondage In The Name Of God](https://mentalbondageinthenameofgod.wordpress.com/)\n","n":0.378}}},{"i":550,"$":{"0":{"v":"Maslow’s Hammer the Reason Why You Should Not Rely on a Single Tool, but Build a Toolbox","n":0.243},"1":{"v":"\n# [Maslow’s Hammer: The Reason Why You Should Not Rely on a Single Tool, but Build a Toolbox](https://typeshare.co/rosso/posts/maslows-hammer-the-reason-why-you-should-not-rely-on-a-single-tool-but-build-a-toolbox)\n\nOver the last year, I have seen a lot of people holding a strong stance on how a specific tool could do everything they wanted. Some others were complaining that the tool they were using could not do everything.\n\n## Beware of Maslow's Hammer\n\n> I don't believe in the existence of such a \"Golden Hammer\". When your tool has a shortcoming you should consider some **complements**.\n\nWhen we are being adamant about the tool we want to use regardless of the problem we risk formulating problems in a way that makes the available tool the right tool, even if it isn't. **This is dangerous because we might end up solving a problem slightly different from the original one. Or even worse, we might create new problems along the way.**\n\n> If you **only have a hammer,** you tend to **see every problem as a nai**l. — Bernard M.

I learned economics by watching [_Marginal Revolution_](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnkEhPBMZcEO0QGu51fDFDg) videos, and now, The Bible Project has fast become my go-to source for studying the best-selling book in human history. The Bible is somehow underrated. The Bible infuses nearly every aspect of Western culture, from our legal codes to human rights (as I wrote in [_Why You’re Christian_](https://perell.com/essay/why-youre-christian/)*).* These short animated videos are a good way to learn about it.\n\n**​**[**The Meaning of Marriage**](https://amzn.to/3tlj7te)**:** The institution of marriage isn’t as strong as it once was. Divorce rates have doubled since the 1960s and the percentage of American adults who are married has fallen from 72 percent in 1960 to only 50 percent in 2008. What’s gone wrong? The premise of this book is that we’ve become disillusioned with marriage because our expectations of it are too high. Using Christian principles, largely from the book of [Ephesians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epistle_to_the_Ephesians), the author argues that successful marriages happen when two people are committed to serving others more than they serve themselves. If you prefer to watch a lecture by the author, [this is a good one to start with](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9THu0PZwwk).\n\n**​**[**Why American Architecture Looks the Same**](https://youtu.be/UX4KklvCDmg)**:** Drive around America and you’ll see the same blend of chain hotels, restaurants, and apartment complexes. This video outlines how incentives come together to make different parts of America look so similar. The video explores the same tradeoff I posed in [_The Microwave Economy_](https://perell.com/essay/the-microwave-economy/)*:* scale is beneficial because it lowers costs and makes the world more efficient but comes at the cost of personality and local diversity.\n\n**​**[**A World Split Apart**](https://www.solzhenitsyncenter.org/a-world-split-apart)**:** Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn was a Russian novelist and critic of both communism and the Soviet Union. In his 1978 commencement speech, he warned against the West’s wholehearted embrace of individual rights and the decreasing responsibilities towards God and society. Voluntarily self-restraint is almost unheard of now. Sexual and economic norms have been forgotten. Ideas like sacrifice and selfless risk aren’t celebrated like they once were either. Instead, in the name of liberation, the West has caved into the allures of consumption, hedonism, and short-term thinking.\n\n**​**[**The Use of Knowledge in Society**](https://www.econlib.org/library/Essays/hykKnw.html)**:** The most important economics paper I’ve ever read. It shows how price signals can help societies make the best use of resources, especially in an ever-changing world that’s impossible to plan for. The price system allows people to coordinate at scale. If there’s a shortage of a given material like copper, the price will rise and thereby incentivize people to produce more of it. When the price fall, the opposite will happen. By following the price system, individuals can contribute to a spontaneous global order by following their incentives. Here’s an [excellent summary](https://elidourado.com/blog/the-use-of-knowledge-in-society/), and [here’s Hayek’s original paper](https://www.econlib.org/library/Essays/hykKnw.html).\n\n**​**[**Northrop Frye’s Biblical Lectures**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbTIAto5PrQ&list=PLYQV14il9XALl_lTZbgbBdrFWdcLOwKBs)**:** This 25-part series explores the synthesis between the Bible and English Literature. It’s worth watching because the Bible infuses just about every aspect of civilization. To the extent that the ideas feel so obvious, it’s only because they’ve been so influential. They’ve become the water we swim in. These lectures explore the metaphorical side of these canonical texts. In one of his lectures, Frye said: “The accuracy of history in the Bible is in inverse proportion to its spiritual value.” [You’ll find a full transcript and show notes for every lecture here.](https://heritage.utoronto.ca/frye/full-lectures)\n\n**​**[**David Foster Wallace, on Consumerism**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1PC1sArw70)**:** Few people understood modern American culture like David Foster Wallace. In particular, he saw how young people in the upper-middle class lived sad and empty internal lives even though their external ones were defined by tremendous comfort. One of his more interesting observations is the decline of quiet in modern life. We listen to music when we’re on our computers, move through our homes with TV in the background, and insist on playing pop music at our restaurants. What’s going on there? Beyond the ideas, this interview is a revealing window into Wallace’s psyche: his fears, his insecurities, and the trepidation he feels about telling the truth.\n\n**​**[**How Trends Begin**](https://twitter.com/david_perell/status/1365445813644783617?s=20)**:** The people who are early to a trend often look so weird that people point and laugh at them. By showing one person dancing at a music festival, then two, then ten, then hundreds, this video reveals how trends — which are too weird to take seriously until they’re too important to ignore — begin.\n\n**​**[**Brave New World, Revisited**](https://amzn.to/3K4tuIg)**:** Brave New World is a dystopian novel by Aldous Huxley, which explores the bad outcomes of a world of abundance where we host hedonistic pleasure in the highest esteem and make people happy with happiness pills. He revisited the core themes in this short non-fiction book. Additional topics include censorship, authoritarianism, thought control, and propaganda.\n\n**Zohar Atkins:** One of the best up-and-coming writers on the Internet, with one of the most intriguing resumes you’ll find. Zohar is a rabbi based in New York City who holds a PhD in theology from Oxford. If you’re looking for something short, start with his Twitter threads on [Leo Strauss](https://twitter.com/ZoharAtkins/status/1353430770086535169) or [Martin Heidegger](https://twitter.com/ZoharAtkins/status/1341445303061385219). If you prefer articles, I recommend [this critique](https://whatiscalledthinking.substack.com/p/spiritual-but-not-religious) of people who are “spiritual but not religious” or this one about [Peter Thiel’s perspective on the Cain and Abel story.](https://whatiscalledthinking.substack.com/p/peter-thiel-on-cain-and-abel)​\n\n**A Guide for the Perplexed:** I’ve long been interested in the shortcomings of Enlightenment thinking. Most of all, I’m skeptical of our commitment to materialism and the scientism that surrounds it. E. F. Schumacher argues that “materialistic scientism” began with the writing of Descartes and Bacon. Since then, intellectuals have de-emphasized the importance of spirituality, beauty, and meaning. [The book is short](https://amzn.to/3mpMSVN), and if you’re looking for a summary, [here’s the Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Guide_for_the_Perplexed).\n\n**​**[**Shantaram**](https://amzn.to/3uppvNn)**:** From a quality of writing perspective, this is among the best books I’ve ever read. It’s a 900-page beast, and when my friend told me about it, I said: “Nope, too long. There’s no way I’m reading that.” Then he [read me the first page](https://twitter.com/david_perell/status/1253142086347415552?s=20), and I was immediately hooked. Maybe it’s because the first sentence encapsulates the book so well: “It took me a long time and most of the world to learn what I know about love and fate and the choices we make, but the heart of it came to me in an instant, while I was chained to a wall and being tortured.”\n\n**​**[**History of Western Philosophy**](https://amzn.to/33DXIkJ)**:** A great book to have on your nightstand because you don’t need to read it in one sitting. It’s a survey of the Western Cannon, from the pre-Socratic philosophers to the early 20th century. You can think of the book as a series of 10-25 page essays, which you can refer to whenever you read a canonical work.\n\n**​**[**Why Winners Keep Winning**](https://ofdollarsanddata.com/why-winners-keep-winning-4e7f221f5b84)**:** Our social universe has very few rules. But if I had to pick an iron law, it’s that winners keep winning. We’ve known this since the New Testament. Specifically, the book of Luke says: “I tell you, that to every one who has will more be given; but from him who has not, even what he has will be taken away.” Here, we have empirical evidence from Stephen King and JK Rowling. Outside the world of writing, this article shows how a small financial advantage at the beginning of your career can lead to outsized gains over time.\n\n[**Where are the Thought Police**](https://johnathanbi.com/essays/where-are-the-thought-police)**:** Why are people in Democratic countries expected to have an educated opinion on so many policy matters, from abortion to foreign policy? Here, Johnathan Bi argues that it’s downstream of our political structure. Since people in a Democracy are theoretically in charge, they should have strong opinions about how a society should be structured. But there are tradeoffs, such as the politicization of social life and, counterintuitively, the suppression of free speech in the private sphere. Alexis de Tocqueville argued that bottom-up thought control is more pervasive than the top-down alternative because even the mightiest of monarchs don’t have the power to police the average person’s speech. No society can ever escape the political and achieve unlimited freedom of thought. But the organization of a society will determine what kinds of thought control exist.\n\n**Applied Divinity Studies:** I don’t know who is behind this blog, but the writing is excellent. The writing orbits around themes of progress, rationality, economics, and technological growth. In particular, I enjoyed an article called [_The Murder of Wilbur Wright_](https://applieddivinitystudies.com/murder-of-wilbur/index.html), a pioneer in the early days of flying. At the beginning of his career, Wilbur was obsessed with the mechanics of aviation. But as he became successful and gained worldwide notoriety for his flight machine, he started to drown in patent disputes and business obligations. Though he was a genius at the frontier of flight, the world pushed him towards administration instead of invention. Tragically, Wilbur died at 45 years old. In the words of *Applied Divinity Studies:* “What hits me hardest is not the material loss, but the squandering of human spirit.” If you’re looking for other recommendations, I suggest [_Beware the Casual Polymath_](https://applieddivinitystudies.com/2020/09/28/polymath/)and [_Asymmetric Opportunities and the Cult of Optionality_](https://applieddivinitystudies.com/asymmetric/index.html).\n\n**​**[**When Breath Becomes Air**](https://amzn.to/3CVB576)**:** If there was ever a book for the heart, this is it. The author, Paul Kalanithi, was born into a Christian family before double majoring in English literature and human biology at Stanford. He was tragically diagnosed with stage IV lung cancer and penned this book in his final days. Above all, I enjoyed his exploration of where science ends, and the soul begins. He writes: “Science may provide the most useful way to organize empirical, reproducible data, but its power to do so is predicated on its inability to grasp the most central aspects of human life: hope, fear, love, hate, beauty, envy, honor, weakness, striving, suffering, virtue.”\n\n**​**[**The Mysteries of Eleusis:**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9VyyV4-3Js) Jesse Michels runs a YouTube show called *American Alchemist,* and is a master at finding interesting guests from outside the media spotlight. I enjoyed his interview with Brian Muraresku, who penned [_The Immortality Key_](https://amzn.to/2ZpTICw)*.* The interview explores the mysterious rituals that once took place in a city called Eleusis, 13 miles north of Athens, which may have shaped early Christianity. Those who partook in these rituals were forbidden from talking about them, so we know very little about what took place. The contents of the Muraresku interview are somewhere on the spectrum between “absolute nonsense” and “the secret history of the world’s biggest religion.”\n\n**​**[**Lewis Mumford and The Magnificent Bribe**](https://reallifemag.com/the-magnificent-bribe/)**:** So much of what we know about how technology shapes society originates with Mumford. He argued that people mistakenly assume that what’s good for the technological system is good for individuals, which isn’t always true. Thus, people need to be bribed with a shiny object that looks appealing in the short term, even if the long term consequences are harmful.\n\n**Richard Hanania:** The Internet has created a new class of “citizen journalists” who own their audiences and produce better writing than many of the major media publications. When it comes to politics, Richard Hanania comes to mind. I recommend two posts in particular: [_Liberals Read, Conservatives Watch TV_](https://richardhanania.substack.com/p/liberals-read-conservatives-watch) and [_Why is Everything Liberal?_](https://richardhanania.substack.com/p/why-is-everything-liberal)\n\n**​**[**Gin, Television, and Cognitive Surplus**](https://livinginliminality.files.wordpress.com/2008/09/gin.pdf)**:** Reading Clay Shirky’s [_Here Comes Everybody_](https://amzn.to/3Ct5Ocs) was one of those moments where I realized how transformative the Internet could become. This speech is a good place to start. He compares modern sitcoms to gin during the Industrial Revolution. People didn’t know what to do with their lives, so they drank and drank and drank. Now, they watch and watch and watch. Only later did society wake up to new ways of living, made possible by the Industrial Revolution. Shirky argues that something similar has happened since World War II. But this time, the social lubricant wasn’t liquor but sitcoms. We spent most of our free time watching TV. Now, with the Internet, we have a giant cognitive surplus. Americans watch 200 billion hours of television every year. Meanwhile, the whole Wikipedia project — every page, every edit, every line of code, and every translation — represents the result of roughly 100 million hours of human thought. Every year, we therefore devote ~2,000 Wikipedia projects to watching television. What if we could transfer some of that energy into something more generative?\n\n**​**[**Why Liberalism Failed**](https://amzn.to/3mot5GK)**:** People increasingly see freedom from attachments as an unalloyed good. But *Notre Dame* professor Patrick Deneen argues that the push for freedom from the constraints of family, tradition, and religion have actually reduced liberty. The more individualistic a culture becomes, the more it needs a big state to support it. If you’re interested in the ideas but aren’t ready to commit to the book, I [recommend this talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlUJ9APtT5M) with the author and [this podcast](https://www.econtalk.org/patrick-deneen-on-why-liberalism-failed/) (with a worthy list of critiques in the comments section).\n\n**The World’s Most Influential Intellectual:** If you’ve never heard of Wang Huning, it’s time to change that. As one of Xi Jinping’s closest advisors and arguably China’s leading ideological theorist. In Chinese literature, his position is known as *dishi,* which translates to “Emperor’s Teacher.” For 20 years, he’s predicted that America will decline because of nihilism and hyper-individualism — both of which have led to skyrocketing inequality, the destruction of the family, and the utter destruction of its heritage. [This piece offers an introduction to his ideas](https://angelanagle.substack.com/p/america-against-america), while [this piece dives into the man himself](https://palladiummag.com/2021/10/11/the-triumph-and-terror-of-wang-huning/).\n\n**Formula One:** One of my recipes for learning faster is to do something with people who are obsessed with that thing. It’s not just that ultra-passionate people know more than the average person. Even if they did, you can look up most information online. The benefit of surrounding yourself with passionate people is that their passion rubs off on you through a process of osmosis. [Humans are mimetic and always will be](https://perell.com/essay/peter-thiel/). The faster we acknowledge how much others shape our interests, the better. To that end, the Internet can be a portal to people with particular passions — crafts, countries, people…whatever. . This YouTube channel illuminates the technical beauty of Formula One racing. Start with [this video about corners](https://youtu.be/YXOYckDATWE) or [this one about tire wear](https://youtu.be/wdj7uzla5pE). For an entry point into the culture of Formula One, I recommend [this Netflix documentary](https://www.netflix.com/title/80204890).\n\n**​**[**Where Ideologies Come From**](https://theamericansun.com/2019/08/27/ideologies-of-delayed-informatization/)**:** Why are so many old ideologies coming back into the public sphere? This essay offers an answer through the prism of a social science article called [_Ideologies of Delayed Industrialization_](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/449767?journalCode=edcc)*.* It describes the persistent cultural patterns that follow the same kinds of rapid and transformative societal changes that the Internet is now bringing to society. When the tectonic plates shift, leaders jostle for power by integrating old ideologies with the fashions of the present. From Gandhi to Confucius to The New York Times, this essay describes the persistence of this cultural pattern.\n\n**​**[**Process Knowledge**](https://future.a16z.com/the-silicon-in-silicon-valley-again/)**:** The author Dan Wang is one of those essayists who continually inspires me to level up my craft. He’s one of the most learned people I know. One time, he spent an hour breaking down the structure of Chinese politics for me and some friends. It was so well done that if it had been public, it would have been a viral YouTube video. Anyways, this essay laments the decline of America’s manufacturing base. Specifically, through the lens of process knowledge which he defines as earned experience that can’t be written down. Beyond that, he paints a vision for Silicon Valley as a place where people give hardware manufacturing the respect it deserves.\n\n**Louis C.K. on Progress:** If you want to understand the human condition, don’t just listen to poets and philosophers. Listen to comedians. These two Louis C.K. clips are as dense with insight as a good book. First, in a clip called “[Everything is amazing & nobody is happy,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdFB7q89_3U)” he talks about how fast even the most magical technologies can go from magnificent to mundane. In [the second one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=5HbYScltf1c), he explores the perils of smartphones and specifically how they distract us from our emotions. When you impulsively pick up your smartphone, you’re often running away from an emotion you don’t want to feel.\n\n**​**[**Ideological Subversion**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOmXiapfCs8)**:** Yuri Bezmenov was a Soviet journalist and a former KGB informant who defected and moved to Canada. He issued a warning to America in a 1985 interview, where he explained how US public opinion could be manipulated. Most frighteningly, he says that under a state of ideological subversion where a person becomes demoralized, new evidence won’t change people’s minds. Under the pen name Tomas D. Schuman, he also wrote a book called *Love Letter to America,* which is strangely hard to find online.\n\n**​**[**Prestige**](https://www.overcomingbias.com/2020/11/what-makes-prestige.html)**:** This essay, inspired by [_Pedigree_](https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691155623/pedigree)*,* argues that corporate recruiters don’t actually care that much about good grades or what students learn in school. Instead, they care about prestigious extracurriculars. They want their employees to be attractive, energetic, articulate, and socially smooth. They choose candidates who optimize not for skills or knowledge but for prestige. For more on this topic, here’s my mini-essay: [_Beware of Chasing Prestige._](https://twitter.com/david_perell/status/1450484108690341899)\n\n**Time:** The clock is one of the defining technologies of the Industrial Age, but most people are blind to the strength of its stranglehold on modern life. It’s a coordination mechanism today, but it began as [a measure of sacrifice](https://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/rob/Courses/InformationInSpeech/CDROM/Literature/LOTwinterschool2006/szabo.best.vwh.net/synch.html) that inspired the time-rate wage. Until then, there was no fair and fungible way to measure how hard people worked instead of the results of their work.\n\n**​**[**A Theory of Verbal Inflation**](https://www.otherlife.co/verbal-inflation/)**:** How is inflating the money supply just like telling verbal lies about social phenomena? In both cases, people who set the rules benefit from [Cantillon Effects](https://bookshop.org/a/55238/9780865978751). If you’re close to the money supply or own stocks, you are first to reap the rewards of money printing. In the social world, you can benefit from “inflations in the word supply.” The author, Justin Murphy, argues that we’ve entered a world of verbal hyperinflation where “public intellectuals today are forced to outbid each other with increasingly insane takes.”\n\n**Max Weber:** When I was living in New York, I audited a philosophy class at Columbia University. The entire semester was focused on one writer: Max Weber. I’ll outsource my recommendation to Zeynep Tufekci, a writer at the *New York Times*. She [said](https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2021/08/my-conversation-with-zeynep-tufekci.html): “90 percent of what you want to understand about the current public health crisis is there in his sociology.” In particular, I recommend his book: [The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism](https://amzn.to/3sSxO54) *—* especially the section about Ben Franklin. If you’re looking for an introduction to his work, start with [this article](https://aeon.co/ideas/what-did-max-weber-mean-by-the-spirit-of-capitalism) or [this one](http://uregina.ca/~gingrich/o1102.htm).\n\n**​**[**CCK Philosophy**](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSkzHxIcfoEr69MWBdo0ppg)**:** This channel is like Nerdwriter for philosophy. Most of the videos have a Marxist bent, even when the focus is on 20th-century philosophers like Theodor Adorno and Felix Guattari. My favorite video is [_Capitalism, Cultural Disintegration, and Buzzfeed_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9srhgHzUFd4). It breaks down a paper that BuzzFeed founder Jonah Peretti wrote about modernity’s influence on identity and the company’s place in our capitalist system.\n\n**Eric Weinstein:** Eric is one of the most generative thinkers I know but doesn’t put much effort into explaining his ideas visually. Luckily, one of my [Write of Passage](https://writeofpassage.school/) students named Jake Orthwein has been doing the work for him. He’s published two videos about Eric’s worldview: the one about [why politics feels like professional wrestling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SZpBvfBxLxc) and another about [the spooky relationship between growth and violence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L39Xr6bU9Mg).\n\n**Before I Go:** Death has a way of bringing clarity to life. Paul Kalanithi had a way of turning those epiphanies into words. You might know him as the author of a lovely book called [_When Breath B_](https://amzn.to/3BHl9VS)_​_[_ecomes Air_](https://amzn.to/3BHl9VS)*.* He wrote this essay, [_Before I Go_](http://stanmed.stanford.edu/2015spring/before-i-go.html)*,* just before he died. My favorite section was about the way time takes a different shape when you’re on your deathbed. Two hours can feel like a minute, and a minute can feel like two hours.\n\n**​**[**Why Are People So Fat?**](https://slimemoldtimemold.com/2021/07/07/a-chemical-hunger-part-i-mysteries/)**:** Put this one in the “interesting, but I don’t know what to make of it” category. It’s a multi-part series about the reasons why Americans have gotten so much more overweight. 100 years ago, the average American male weighed 155 pounds. Today, that number has climbed up to 195. [Horses](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1439-0396.2007.00789_8.x) and [wild animals](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/pdf/10.1098/rspb.2010.1890) are getting fatter too. Craziest of all, the author argues that maybe, just maybe, the obesity epidemic isn’t the direct result of diet, carbs, sugar, fat, calories, or any of the conventional culprits. This is a longggggg series and you can [find all the installments here](https://slimemoldtimemold.com/tag/a-chemical-hunger/).\n\n**​**[**The Principles of Urbanism**](https://threader.app/thread/883181352933236736)**:** For all the progress we’ve made, we’ve somehow lost our ability to build cities that nurture the soul. A pseudonymous writer named Wrath of Gnon argues that we’re ignoring the principles of urbanism and humane architecture — which we discovered many centuries ago. Here, he critiques our contemporary approach to urbanism and offers a classical alternative.\n\n**​**[**The Technological Society**](https://amzn.to/38g3ZlL)**:** Jacques Ellul is worth reading because his work synthesizes two influences you rarely see together: Christianity and Karl Marx. He comes to similar conclusions as Marx, but instead of focusing on capitalism, he focuses on technology. Though his writing is dense with insight, it can be dry to read. Thus, in addition to [The Technological Society](https://amzn.to/3Dn29h6) (skip the mass market paperback edition), I recommend [this essay](https://www.thenewatlantis.com/publications/confronting-the-technological-society), [this controversial reflection](https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/ted-kaczynski-the-system-s-neatest-trick), or this [book-length synopsis of his work](https://amzn.to/38g3ZlL).\n\n**​**[**Peter Thiel’s Worldview**](https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3PSWXNTHIHYNB/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1984878530)**:** Most of the jibber-jabber about Peter Thiel is superficial and doesn’t cut to the heart of his worldview. As I wrote in [_Peter Thiel’s Religion_](https://perell.com/essay/peter-thiel/)*,* you can’t understand Thiel if you don’t understand the influence of Mimetic Theory and, by extension, Christianity on his worldview. [This Amazon book review offers a succinct explanation.](https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3PSWXNTHIHYNB/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=1984878530) The author explains why Thiel fears globalization and the “one-world state” that’d come with it. That kind of homogenization would lead to runaway Mimetic conflict and perhaps, the apocalyptic outcomes that Girard and the *Book of Revelation* warn against.\n\n**​**[**Giannis Antetokounmpo**](https://twitter.com/david_perell/status/1416642821663035396?s=20)**:** Wise words in a [short video](https://twitter.com/david_perell/status/1416642821663035396?s=20) from this year’s NBA Finals MVP: Focus on the past; that’s ego. Focus on the future; that’s pride. Focus on the present; that’s humility.\n\n**​**[**Intelligence Killed Genius**](https://guzey.com/intelligence-killed-genius/)**:** Where did all the geniuses go? They were killed by the concept of intelligence. The author argues that our obsession with intelligence discourages people to work on ambitious problems because people talk themselves out of pursuing them.\n\n**​**[**The Inner Ring**](https://www.lewissociety.org/innerring/)**:** C.S Lewis gave this speech in 1947 and the ideas are as relevant today as they were back then. My favorite concept is that there are two systems of influence in any organization: the official one and the unofficial one. There are explicit org charts and implicit ones. Train yourself to make sense of the implicit ones, where the true dynamics of power lie. Also, if you’re a C.S. Lewis fan, you’ll like my essay: [_Why You’re Christian_](https://perell.com/essay/why-youre-christian/)_._\n\n**José** **Ricón:** I met José at an Emergent Ventures meetup. It took me ~30 seconds to realize he had one of the sharpest minds I’ve ever come across. He can process information faster than just about anybody I’ve ever met. His posts are long, but if you find one that interests you, I can almost guarantee that it’s one of the best introductions to the subject online. If you’re interested in education, I recommend this primer on [_Bloom’s Two-Sigma Problem_](https://nintil.com/bloom-sigma)*.* And if you’re interested in cities, I recommend his post on [rising construction costs](https://nintil.com/building-skyscrapers-and-spending-on-major-projects).\n\n**​**[**Ten Ways to Destroy the Imagination of Your Child**](https://amzn.to/3hWELgq)**:** I found this book through an [excellent Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/wrathofgnon/status/1126114639517896704). I looked up the author, saw that he was famous for translating Dante, and immediately purchased the book. It’s about the way modernity suppresses childhood imagination. My favorites are “cut all heroes down to size” and “replace the fairy tale with political cliches and fads.” Awe and wonder are under-rated virtues.\n\n**​**[**Oops, Simon Sarris Did it Again**](https://simonsarris.substack.com/p/the-most-precious-resource-is-agency)**:** This man doesn’t miss. Sarris is an engineer living in New Hampshire. He published a wonderful essay called [_The Most Precious Resource is Agency_](https://simonsarris.substack.com/p/the-most-precious-resource-is-agency)*.* It’s about our inability to deal with ambitious children, and in turn, beat the drive out of them. In all his writing, I admire the way he balances the spiritual and the material. And though he has a special reverence for beauty, he always remembers to appreciate the mundane. For something longer, I strongly recommend his essay: [_In Praise of Gods_](https://simonsarris.substack.com/p/in-praise-of-the-gods)*,* which explores the limits of rationality*.*\n\n[**The Condition of the Working Class in England**](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/condition-working-class/index.htm)**:** I’m perpetually interested in how the Industrial Revolution changed society and consciousness. This account from Friedrich Engels was written in 1845 and had a major influence on Karl Marx. It describes the horrid working conditions in industrial cities like Manchester and Liverpool, where people were divorced from nature, suffered through horrid working conditions, and disproportionately died from diseases like measles and smallpox. Though the whole book is available for free, the [introduction](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/condition-working-class/ch02.htm) and [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Condition_of_the_Working_Class_in_England) provide good introductions. If you want more, [you’ll enjoy this lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDY5vuMW90s).\n\n**​**[**McLuhan Unbound**](https://amzn.to/3z9eaEJ)**:** This is a hidden gem, but I’m not sure how to describe it. I could call it a book, but it’s too short for that. I could call it a collection of pamphlets, but the ideas are too sophisticated for that too. We’ll go with an [anthology of essays](https://amzn.to/34ZIILo). They were written in the most creative period of Marshall McLuhan’s life after he published [_The Gutenberg Galaxy_](https://amzn.to/3vdQKe7) but before he published his seminal book: [_Understanding Media_](https://amzn.to/3iAp0h7)*.* I like it both because it’s colorful (which means I can keep it in my living room) and because it’s designed to be read for 10 minutes at a time. Since it’s so easy to read, it doubles as spaced repetition for one of my favorite writers. If you’re looking for an intro to McLuhan, I also recommend [_The Medium is the Massage_](https://amzn.to/3pwKahL) and this [talk with Terrance McKenna](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aljs5vlW2u4).\n\n**​**[**Losing Your Freedom**](https://twitter.com/mutatrum/status/1401199233307394050)**:** This one is heavy. When my friend texted it to me, he said: “I need a cigarette with this.” It’s written by Ross Ulbricht, who founded the [Silk Road marketplace](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silk_Road_(marketplace)>). He wrote this [speech](https://twitter.com/mutatrum/status/1401199233307394050?s=20) from prison because he’s been given a lifetime sentence without parole. It’s worth reading, no matter what you think about him. He talks about the way we dehumanize prisoners and the torture of losing your freedom. [If you prefer audio, listen to this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3V_SkLxgQjQ&t=232s).\n\n**​**[**The Tyranny of Time**](https://www.noemamag.com/the-tyranny-of-time)**:** There are two kinds of time: [body time and mechanical time](https://twitter.com/david_perell/status/1299778651118952449?s=20). Body time moves by the rhythm of your heart. You eat when you’re hungry and sleep when you’re tired. It moves fast when we’re in the flow and slowly when we’re bored. Mechanical time is the opposite. It always moves at the same speed and does not respond to the needs of individuals. When I’m relaxing, I try to be on body time as much as possible. That’s why I don’t wear a watch and why there are no clocks in my apartment. Though people used to protest against time, we’ve accepted it as an inevitable part of the modern world. [This essay shows how that happened](https://www.noemamag.com/the-tyranny-of-time).\n\n**​**[**Michael Sugrue’s YouTube Channel**](https://youtube.com/channel/UCFaYLR_1aryjfB7hLrKGRaQ)**:** This guy is an outstanding speaker and delivers all kinds of philosophy lectures about topics ranging from [_Nietzche and the Death of God_](https://youtu.be/Smq5uRhM_IA)*,* to [_The Frankfurt School_](https://youtu.be/xX9EI8wEyuY)*,* to [_Romantic Literature_](https://youtu.be/uPvmY8PLQBg)*.* The channel is such a hidden gem.\n\n**​**[**Tribe**](https://amzn.to/2RZfwBr)**:** File this book in the “we should be skeptical of modernity” camp. The author makes the case that the design of tribal societies make us happier by giving us loyalty, belonging, and meaning. For all the benefits of modern society, it causes modern people to not feel necessary. I picked it up after my [nature retreat](https://www.sacredhunting.com/). Out there, it didn’t matter who you were. The summer heat doesn’t hold back against anybody and rattlesnakes don’t care what you do for a living. That forced our group to come together and led to the kind of communal bonding experience that cities make difficult. On this topic, my friend Joe Wells wrote an excellent essay arguing for [compulsory public service in America](https://perell.com/fellowship/compulsory-national-service/).\n\n**​**[**Dominion**](https://amzn.to/3uS62X4)**:** I’m writing a long-form essay to explore how Christian metaphysics underpin the Western view of morality. To construct the ideas for my essay, I’m building upon [this stellar, 600-page piece of historical scholarship from Tom Holland.](https://amzn.to/3uS62X4) He argues that the Bible shaped Western thought, even if we’ve painted over those ideas with Enlightenment notions of truth and reason. On that note, it’s filled with golden nuggets like this: “That all men had been created equal, and endowed with an inalienable right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness, were not remotely self-evident truths… The truest and ultimate seedbed of the American republic—no matter what some of those who had composed its founding documents might have cared to think—was the book of Genesis.” What a provocative argument. For an introduction, I recommend this [video interview](https://youtu.be/-qGfkFlZKgA) and this [book review](https://thecritic.co.uk/issues/december-2019/eternal-resurrection/).\n\n**​**[**Free Parking**](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/05/parking-drives-housing-prices/618910/)**:** Lewis Mumford once wrote: “The right to access every building in a city by private motorcar in an age when everyone owns such a vehicle, is actually the right to destroy the city.” To that end, I joke that Americans travel to Europe to visit the kinds of cities they’ve made illegal to build in their home country. For now, we’ll focus on the high costs of parking. Making parking free drives up the cost of housing, [increases pollution](https://www.cato-unbound.org/2011/04/04/donald-shoup/free-parking-or-free-markets), and reduces urban density. This statistic stands out. The Walt Disney Concert Hall cost $274 million to build. Of that total, the first $100 million went to pay for the underground parking structure, which is not a cultural landmark.\n\n​[**Gardens: An Essay on the Human Condition**](https://onartandaesthetics.com/2016/10/01/gardens-an-essay-on-the-human-condition/)**:** This is one of my all-time favorite short essays. Like much of my favorite writing, it takes a mundane concept and makes you realize that it’s filled with depth. Gardens are everywhere in mythology. As a metaphor for life, it’s no coincidence that the bible story begins in The Garden of Eden. They balance order and chaos, life and death, nature and nurture. By holding opposites in harmonious tension, they are sites of epiphanies in the world of literature.\n\n**​**[**The Enlightenment and Human Rights**](https://revolution.chnm.org/exhibits/show/liberty--equality--fraternity/enlightenment-and-human-rights)**:** Lots of people wrote to me with recommended links after I published the [_Why You’re Christian_](https://perell.com/essay/why-youre-christian/)essay*.* This was the best one. It shows the relationship between human rights and the Enlightenment, with a focus on the French Revolution. While writing the [_Declaration of Rights of Man and Citizen_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declaration_of_the_Rights_of_Man_and_of_the_Citizen)in 1789, French intellectuals wanted to uphold their ideas with reason instead of tradition. As a result, the words “France” or “French” never appear in the actual declaration.\n\n**​**[**The Death of Ivan Ilyich:**](https://amzn.to/2YMaA2B)A heartfelt but sad meditation on life by Leo Tolstoy. It tells the story of a high-court judge in 19th century Russia who suffers from a terminal illness. Unlike Tolstoy’s other books, this one is short enough to read in one sitting.\n\n**​**[**Geography and History**](https://unchartedterritories.substack.com/p/geography-is-the-chessboard-of-history)**:** It’s wild that we spent so much time memorizing dates in history class because they’re legit one of the least important things about history. Dates are important insofar as they give you a sense of timelines and overlapping events which may have influenced each other. But relative to how much attention they receive, they’re trivial. So why do we study them? Here’s a guess: Because they’re easy to grade on tests. This essay offers an alternative approach to studying history. And the opening sentence is so provocative and so attention-grabbing that I’m going to share it with my writing students: “We think we’re taught History. But we’re really taught Propaganda.” Yep, you just clicked.\n\n**​**[**How Politics Became Pro Wrestling**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SZpBvfBxLxc)**:** There’s an idea in professional wrestling called Kayfabe, where people pretend something is serious even though everybody knows it’s fake. This video, made by a [Write of Passage](https://writeofpassage.school/) alumnus, is the best description I’ve seen. Ten minutes and you’ll forever enhance your understanding of contemporary, media-driven politics (which I also discuss in [this essay](https://perell.com/essay/what-the-hell-is-going-on/)).\n\n**​**[**What the Mouse Knows**](https://simonsarris.substack.com/p/what-the-mouse-knows)**:** A lovely short story from one of my favorite online writers: Simon Sarris. It explores the difference between the map and the territory, which I discussed in [_Expression is Compression_](https://perell.com/essay/expression-is-compression/)*.* Though we make maps to make sense of the world, actual reality is always more complicated than we think. That limitation presents opportunities if you know how to look at the world. As Ishmael*,* a character in [_Moby Dick_](https://amzn.to/3y7cJGB) says: “It is not down in any map; true places never are.” Given that, we should find opportunities in map-less spaces and look for blindspots on the map of human knowledge.\n\n**​**[**The Origins of Entrepreneurship**](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2596846)**:** This paper explores the core personality traits of entrepreneurs. The authors identify a few, the most interesting of which is that they’re more likely to have done “illicit activities.” But the key line is that “the number one predictor of entrepreneurship is asymmetric information about skill levels.” By that, the authors are talking about people who are more talented than they are credentialed. For example, they’re the kinds of people who know how to build a business, even though they never went to college.\n\n**​**[**Munda and Modia**](https://peakd.com/philosophy/@brianoflondon/mundia-and-modia-the-two-worlds-in-which-we-live)**:** Put this article in the “forever changed my worldview category.” The author argues that humans live in two worlds: one devoted to the immutable laws of the physical world and another devoted to the subjective laws of the social world. The world we spend most of our time in dictates our values and political orientation. In life, we create problems when we try to use strategies from one world to succeed in the other.\n\n**​**[**Completing Girard**](https://johnathanbi.com/my-book/introduction)**:** Johnathan Bi, one of the smartest up-and-coming philosophers I know, published a short book about Rene Girard. It’s all available for free on his site.\n\n**​**[**Martin Gurri Summary**](http://www.arnoldkling.com/blog/shorter-martin-gurri/)**:** If you asked me to name a writer who is virtually unknown today but who will be hailed in history books, Martin Gurri would be my answer. He’s absolutely brilliant. His book*,* [_The Revolt of the Public_](https://amzn.to/3eYGKRQ)*,* was the inspiration behind my *[What the Hell is Going On](https://perell.com/essay/what-the-hell-is-going-on/)* essay. His book is worth reading in full, but [this 2-minute summary](http://www.arnoldkling.com/blog/shorter-martin-gurri/) is an excellent synopsis of his thinking.\n\n[**On Urbanism**](https://threadreaders.com/thread/embed/883181352933236736)**:** An epic Twitter thread on the design characteristics of traditional urbanism. Though humanity has progressed on many fronts, we have undoubtedly regressed in our ability to build cities. Modern cities have none of the charm as the ones we built in Europe 500 years ago. [This thread](https://threadreaders.com/thread/embed/883181352933236736) is the best explanation of what modern cities are lacking.\n\n**Devon Zuegel’s City Writing:** I’ve long admired Devon Zuegel’s writing. We [recorded a podcast together](https://perell.com/podcast/devon-zuegel/) a while back about cities and urban planning. This week, she [published some field notes](https://devonzuegel.com/post/field-notes-miami) about what it’s like to live in Miami. With a 58% foreign-born population, Miami is the only major US city with a majority foreign-born population. Other topics include its immigrant spirit, the extravagant architecture, and the diversity of neighborhoods from South Beach to Little Havana. Devon’s also written about [Bangalore](https://devonzuegel.com/post/a-day-in-bangalore), [Jakarta](https://devonzuegel.com/post/a-day-in-jakarta), and [Beijing](https://devonzuegel.com/post/a-day-in-beijing).\n\n**​**[**A Lovely Book of Aphorisms**](https://amzn.to/2QMetDE)**:** I don’t know how I found this book, but I’m glad I did. It’s a collection of aphorisms (honestly, they’re basically tweets) about topics like writing, psychology, and economics. Of course, my favorite ones are about writing: (1)”No style guide can address the chief defect in writing, which is having nothing to say” and (2) “People say they can’t draw when they mean they can’t see, and that they can’t write when they mean they can’t think.” This one is so fun.\n\n**​**[**Manufacturing Consent**](https://amzn.to/3thexuf)**:** Noam Chomsky is one of the most thought-provoking intellectuals alive today. He’s at his best when he’s talking about how the media controls thought. In one interview, a reporter asked him: “Do you really think I’m self-censoring right now?” Chomsky replied: “I’m not saying that you think you’re self-censoring. I’m sure you believe every word you’re saying. But I’m saying that if you believed something different, you wouldn’t be sitting where you’re sitting.” For more, I recommend this [explainer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manufacturing_Consent), [this YouTube interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pf-tQYcZGM4), or [Chomsky’s book on the subject](https://amzn.to/3cnYi8D).\n\n**Chartism:** I can’t get this idea out of my head. Apparently, it goes back to the British male [suffrage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chartism) movement in the mid-19th century and the work of Thomas Carlyle, who was [critical of Chartism’s hold over decision-making](https://books.google.com/books?id=Z5oQAAAAYAAJ&pg=PP7#v=onepage&q&f=false). Here’s how I interpret the practical implications of the idea: Policymakers fall somewhere on the spectrum of pro-chart and anti-chart. Pro-chartists think that data can explain the world, and the more we have, the better. But anti-chartists think that relentless data accumulation is misguided because it offers false certainty and misses the big picture interpretation. As the saying goes: “More fiction is written in Excel than Word.”\n\n**​**[**The Holy Church of Christ Without Christ**](https://www.thepullrequest.com/p/the-holy-church-of-christ-without)**:** I’m recommending this one as much for the writing style as the content itself. I was reflecting on my education when I realized that I went through K-12 and then all of college without ever reading the Gospels. Even if I’m not religious, that’s insane. Word-for-word, it’s hard to find a document that’s shaped Western thinking more. Among other things, such as the myopia of utilitarianism (ruling by Excel spreadsheet) and the relationship between science and belief, [this essay explains why](https://www.thepullrequest.com/p/the-holy-church-of-christ-without).\n\n**​**[**Philosophize This and Critical Theory**](https://www.philosophizethis.org/)**:** [The Frankfurt School](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankfurt_School) is one of the most important philosophical hubs of the 20th century. It began in Germany, but most of the philosophers ended up at Columbia University in New York. They were critical of capitalism and Marxism, so they tried to reimagine both of them. But unfortunately, even though their ideas are worthwhile, their writing me want to bang my head into a wall of nails. For help, [I turned to Stephen West’s excellent 7-part series](https://www.philosophizethis.org/podcast/frankfurt-school-intro), which is the best explainer I’ve found about the Frankfurt School. His archives are impressive. You may also enjoy his episodes about [Hannah Arendt](https://www.philosophizethis.org/podcast/banality-of-evil), [Carl Schmitt](https://www.philosophizethis.org/podcast/anti-liberalism-pt-1), and [Gilles Deleuze](https://www.philosophizethis.org/podcast/deleuze-pt-1).\n\n**​**[**Human Nature**](https://twitter.com/david_perell/status/1365445813644783617?s=20)**:** This video is a masterclass in psychology. The first person to do something always looks weird. People laugh. Then somebody else joins. Then the crowds come in, and the person who started the whole thing goes from looking like a goon to looking like a genius.\n\n**​**[**Social Status**](http://www.meltingasphalt.com/social-status-down-the-rabbit-hole/)**:** Humans are wired to think about social status. E.O. Wilson argued that prestige took off spectacularly because our ancestors lived in semi-permanent home-bases that needed to be guarded collectively. Protecting the fort gave them an incentive to team up and cooperate. This article by Kevin Simler is the best read about our uniquely human ability to quantify prestige and the way we lust for more of it. It builds upon the work of Joe Heinrich, [who I interviewed last year](https://perell.com/podcast/joe-henrich-what-makes-society-smart/).\n\n**​**[**The Age of Entitlement**](https://amzn.to/2QmF6iy)**:** A take on American history so different from what I learned in high school. People say it’s a critique of the Civil Rights movement, but I don’t think that’s it. The author is actually quite supportive of it. Rather, it’s an illustration of the unintended consequences of it: rising federal power, bureaucratic bloat, and increasing government debt. Here’s an example. Federal loans and grants to college students, adjusted for inflation were $800 million in 1963-64, $15 billion in 1973-74, and $157 billion in 2010-11. Moreover, students at the University of Phoenix, the largest collector of Pell Grant tuition, now owe $35 billion in taxpayer-backed federal loans. To add insult to injury, their default rate is higher than their graduation rate. That’s bonkers. If you prefer an interview with the author, [here’s a good one](https://youtu.be/36-nBl5uBmc).\n\n**​**[**Paris Review Interviews**](https://www.theparisreview.org/interviews)**:** When I think about epic series from classic media publications, the Paris Review interviews come to mind. They’ve interviewed some of the greatest minds of the past century: Kurt Vonnegut, Toni Morrison, Maya Angelou, Ernest Hemingway, and Robert Caro come to mind. And they are consistently the best interviews I’ve seen of them. You’ll need a subscription to read them, but damn, it’s worth it. This week, I read interviews with the documentary film-maker [Frederick Wiseman](https://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/7210/the-art-of-documentary-no-1-frederick-wiseman) and novelist [Milan Kundera](https://theparisreview.org/interviews/2977/the-art-of-fiction-no-81-milan-kundera).\n\n**​**[**An Intro to Marshall McLuhan**](https://www.philosophizethis.org/podcast/episode-149-on-media-pt-2-marshall-mcluhan): If there’s a recurring theme in my work, it’s that more people should study McLuhan’s ideas. Here’s an excellent podcast introduction from Philosophize This, with a [full transcript](https://www.philosophizethis.org/transcript/episode-149-transcript).\n\n**Lewis Mumford**: What an under-rated talent. Mumford is the forefather of the media and technology studies movement that gained steam in the mid-20th-century. I’ve been reading his book, [_Technics and Civilization_](https://amzn.to/39Wz2TV). The owner of my local Austin bookstore knows my taste, so she also picked [_Architecture as a Home for Man_](https://amzn.to/2Nkwd7s) up for me, which I plan to read afterward.\n\n**​​**[**Shop Class as Soulcraft**](https://www.thenewatlantis.com/publications/shop-class-as-soulcraft)**:** One of the best ways to find good things to read is to look for the essays that were so good that they [eventually became books](https://amzn.to/3c6yZHQ). For a series of essays that eventually became books, I recommend [this compilation](https://josephcwells.com/curations/essays-that-became-books) from Joe Wells. This essay reveals the downsides in the transition from physical labor to knowledge work. Manual trades have lost their honor and the material world has lost its mystique. So has craftsmanship, where people pursue excellence for its own sake. Part of the challenge is that the media narrative is shaped by urbanites who prioritize knowledge work and vaguely scoff at manual laborers. But in praise of craftsmanship, the author writes: “The tangible elements of craft were appealing as an antidote to vague feelings of unreality, diminished autonomy, and a fragmented sense of self that were especially acute among the professional classes.”\n\n**​**[**Thomas Aquinas**](http://www.quebecoislibre.org/06/060122-5.htm)**:** One of my main intellectual explorations of late has been the way Greek ideas have fused into the Christian worldview. Plato’s influence came through Augustine, and Aristotle’s influence came through Aquinas. Most thought-provoking to me is Aquinas‘ idea that philosophy and theology don’t contradict. Instead, he believes that they play complementary roles in the quest for truth. He saw human knowledge as a pyramid with science at the base, philosophy above it, and theology at the top. Thus, he believes that faith does not contradict nature, science, or human knowledge. Together, he says that they cooperate in the advancement of truth.\n\n[**Thorstein Velben’s Theory of the Leisure Class (Updated)**](https://quillette.com/2019/11/16/thorstein-veblens-theory-of-the-leisure-class-a-status-update/)**:** Written by one of my favorite up-and-coming writers, [Rob Henderson](https://www.robkhenderson.com/) (whose entire body of work is worth exploring). This article is an introduction to his theory of “luxury beliefs,” where high-class people adopt beliefs that take a toll on the lower class but don’t cost them anything. To prove his argument, he points to [research](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ejsp.2620) that shows that the desire for status is a positive feedback loop, where the highest status people are the most likely to want *even more* status.\n\n[**Gut Feelings**](https://amzn.to/2NjGYHK)**:** Michael Polanyi once said: “We know more than we can tell.” All of us have centuries of evolutionary wisdom inside of us that we ignore whenever we ignore our intuition. That’s why I’ve long been skeptical of the way we bash cognitive biases. There’s wisdom in things like the sunk cost bias and the availability bias. Though we should educate ourselves on the shortcomings of intuitive thinking, [this book](https://amzn.to/2NjGYHK) argues that we should give heuristics and gut feelings more respect. If you’re looking for something shorter, [this article](https://www.edge.org/conversation/gerd_gigerenzer-smart-heuristics) is a good introduction to the author’s thinking.\n\n**​**[**Carl Schmitt’s Political Theology**](https://churchlifejournal.nd.edu/articles/can-schmitts-political-theology-be-redeemed/)**:** Dense, but for all the right reasons. Though Carl Schmitt is quite a controversial political thinker, his work has been recommended to me many times. This introduction focuses on the Venn diagram of political theory and Judeo-Christian thought. The main claim is that the contemporary political environment relies on a Christian substrate. If so, the justification for many of our laws come not from the Enlightenment, but from Christianity. I particularly like Schmitt’s definition of sovereignty: “The person who gets to decide upon the exception to the rule.” If you want to see who really holds power, look there.\n\n**​**[**Einstein’s Dreams**](https://amzn.to/385MnK8): A splendid collection of short stories from the philosopher-physicist Alan Lightman. All of them are about time, relativity, and physics as if they were the dreams of Albert Einstein. My favorite one is about [body time vs. mechanical time](https://twitter.com/david_perell/status/1299778651118952449?s=20). Body time is the world of hunger, moods, and circadian rhythms, while mechanical time is the world of clocks and alarms. It‘d be fun to switch between these time speeds throughout the year. To help myself enter the calm flow of body time, I’ve deliberately chosen not to put any clocks in my home.\n\n**LSD and Acid in the 1960s**: I’ve spent the week reading Joan Didion’s *[Slouching Towards Bethlehem](https://amzn.to/3rHGvOO)* and Tom Wolfe’s [_Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test_](https://amzn.to/2X3KTte)*.* Both are reflections on a time when the government experimented with these powerful substances, and drugs took over parts of San Francisco’s social life. Didion’s take is the pessimistic one, Wolfe’s is more optimistic. The movement began in 1959, when the US government began testing the effects of acid and LSD on its citizens as part of a CIA mind control program called [Project MKUltra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_MKUltra). For a video introduction, I recommend [this YouTube documentary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uh2kK5IfS-8).\n\n**​**[**Beauty is the Privilege We Never Talk About**](https://medium.com/@sfard/the-greatest-privilege-we-hardly-talk-about-beauty-7db3f70c1116): Being beautiful makes life much, much easier. First, we’ll start with the obvious. Speed dating research [shows](https://www.psychologytoday.com/ca/blog/dating-and-mating/201701/why-physical-attraction-matters-and-when-it-might-not) that beauty is the most important factor in choosing a mate. But attractive people are [also](https://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/49392/2/MPRA_paper_49392.pdf) more likely to be hired for a job and seen as competent. This quote from the article stands out, even though it’s so extreme that I’m skeptical of it: “This bias for beauty can cause real harm. In a meta analysis of the role of attractiveness in criminal sentencing, it was found that unattractive people received 120–305 percent longer sentences than attractive people. As a comparison, another study found that black people received 6–20 percent longer sentences than white people. Yes, in criminal sentencing, looks were over 10x more important than race.” Beauty, then, is the ultimate privilege.\n\n**The Dream of Philosophy:** A two-part series about the history of modern philosophy. The first book, [_The Dream of Reason_](https://amzn.to/3po2tEG)*,* begins in Ancient Greece and goes to the Renaissance. The second,[_The Dream of Enlightenment_](https://amzn.to/3poqJq9), picks up where the first one left off and focuses on The Enlightenment. The ideas are clearly written but aren’t dumbed down, which is what you want from a book about philosophy.\n\n**​**[**The Imitation of Christ**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Imitation_of_Christ)**:** In honor of Christmas, this is the most widely-read Christian devotional book outside of the Bible. It was published in the 15th century, and by 1650, it was one of the most published books in existence with a grand total of… 745 copies. The book was published anonymously. With humility and inspired by Christian teachings, the author wrote: “One should love to be unknown… Do not let the writer’s authority or learning influence you, be it little or great, but let the love of pure truth attract you to read. Do not ask ‘Who said this?’ but pay attention to what is said.” Amen to that.\n\n**​**[**Pete Davis Harvard Commencement Speech**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHMHK4i_oLg)**:** My life improved dramatically once I stopped chasing optionality and committed to the things that mattered to me most. The catalyst was an article called [_The Trouble With Optionality_](https://twitter.com/david_perell/status/1342300065096998917?s=20)*,* which I can’t recommend enough. On the same theme, this commencement speech is a critique of what the philosopher Zygmunt Bauman called “Liquid Modernity,” a state of ambivalent identities where people switch between identities without committing to any of them, just so they can “keep their options open.”\n\n**Abraham Joshua Heschel:** I discovered Heschel in the Fall on a [recommendation from Rabbi David Wolpe](https://perell.com/podcast/rabbi-david-wolpe-jewish-wisdom/). And boy, am I glad I did. He’s an artist with words. I started with [_The Sabbath_](https://amzn.to/38vxsaW)*,* and last night, I read the vast majority of [_Man’s Quest for God_](https://amzn.to/38xLAAx) in one sitting. No matter your faith, you will enjoy his books if you’re feeling contemplative.\n\n**[Gardens Need Walls: On Boundaries, Ritual, and Beauty](https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2015/03/04/gardens-need-walls-on-boundaries-ritual-and-beauty/):** Walls are everywhere in nature. In complex systems, boundaries are everywhere. Ancestral, well-established solutions to basic problems like food and housing also solve higher-level problems like the need for social cohesion. New technologies tend to solve basic problems, but not higher-level ones.\n\n**[Gardens: An Essay on the Human Condition](https://onartandaesthetics.com/2016/10/01/gardens-an-essay-on-the-human-condition/):** It is no coincidence that the bible story begins in The Garden of Eden. Gardens are a metaphor for life. They balance order and chaos, life and death, nature and nurture.\n\n**[Definite Optimism as Human Capital](https://danwang.co/definite-optimism-as-human-capital/):**  We can nurture optimism by developing a greater appreciation for industry and reaching for higher economic growth. Pushing forward the technological frontier isn’t somebody else’s problem. It’s our responsibility.\n\n**[The Big Here and the Long Now](http://longnow.org/essays/big-here-long-now/):** Brian Eno is the ultimate polymath. Part musician, part intellectual, Eno teamed up with Stewart Brand to found the Long Now Foundation and change how humans think about time. The Long Now is the recognition that the precise moment you’re in grows out of the past and is a seed for the future. The longer your sense of Now, the more past and future it includes. I also recommend [Eno’s interviews.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=13FHJH19_e4)\n\n**[The Founder’s Paradox by Peter Thiel](http://blakemasters.com/peter-thiels-cs183-startup):** Extreme innovators are full of contradictions. They are extreme insiders _and_ extreme outsiders, gods and scapegoats. Inspired by Rene Girard’s Mimetic Theory, Peter Thiel’s “Founder Paradox” will radically transform how you think about talent, creativity and personality traits.\n\n**[Peter Zeihan on the Future of Geopolitics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0eJK4Avk2M):** Peter Zeihan shares a narrative-defying perspective on the future of the world. A geopolitical strategist, Zeihan weaves insights about demographics, security, and global energy into a charming and humorous talk, which is as fun as it is interesting.\n\n**[Leverage Points: Places to Intervene in a System](http://donellameadows.org/archives/leverage-points-places-to-intervene-in-a-system/):** Most books are extended articles. This article is a shortened book. It’s jam-packed with powerful information. It’s the best introduction to systems I’ve ever seen. Systems are everywhere, and if you want to change them, the author recommends 12 places to intervene, and highlights the strengths and weaknesses of each one.\n\n[**Jaques Ellul and Marshall McLuhan**](https://youtu.be/CcsU7WMfr3o)**:** I’ve been pulling at a bizarre intellectual paradox. I am simultaneously a strong believer in progress, but believe we ignore the wisdom of tradition at our own peril. Drawing on the two edges of a single string makes me a progressive and a reactionary. I’ve been studying mid-20th-century technological theory to resolve the tension. I’ve cited McLuhan in a handful of essays, and Ellul’s ideas mesh with McLuhan’s observations. [This is the best introduction](https://youtu.be/CcsU7WMfr3o) I’ve found to the similarities and differences between them. You’ll enjoy the ideas, even if you don’t have any background knowledge on Ellul or McLuhan.\n\n**The Cult of Optionality:** I was afraid of commitment for too long. I thought that committing to a project for multiple years would limit the number of opportunities at my disposal. But the opposite has happened. Branding myself as “The Writing Guy” and focusing full-time on Write of Passage (which I intend to do for the next decade) has paradoxically increased the number of professional opportunities available to me. Luckily, many authors have made this point more eloquently than I just did. I recommend this [piece from Byrne Hobart](https://byrnehobart.medium.com/optionality-is-for-innumerate-cowards-f2c5a759b607), this one from [Applied Divinity Studies](https://applieddivinitystudies.com/asymmetric/index.html), and especially this one from a [Harvard professor named Mihir Desai](https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2017/5/25/desai-commencement-ed/).\n\n[**Dishwashers**](https://www.aier.org/article/lets-talk-about-ghastly-dishwashers/)**:** There are two ways to read this article. First, you can read it for the literal interpretation. Dishwashers aren’t as powerful as they used to be. They used to wash our dishes in less than an hour, and leave them shiny and clean. But today, it takes 3-4 hours to clean your dishes, and dishwashers don’t work as well as they used to. That brings me to the second way you can read this article. Deep down, it’s a story about the downsides of regulation and environmentalism. Read the article with both lenses.\n\n**Michael Polanyi:** A [very smart friend](https://twitter.com/iamlikelywrong) turned me onto Polanyi’s ideas. Most of his work is about the intersection between markets, capitalism, and society, but I also enjoyed learning about [Polanyi’s Paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polanyi%E2%80%99s_paradox) — the idea that we know more than we can explain. If you’re interested in Polanyi, start with this essay called [_The Uruk Machine_](https://samzdat.com/2017/08/28/the-uruk-machine/)*,* which also talks about the work of James Scott and Eric Hoffer.\n\n**Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act:** One of the core failings of the U.S. political system is that we focus so much on the executive branch that we lose sight of crucial pieces of legislation in other parts of the government. These days, certain lawmakers are fighting to repeal Section 230 of the Communication Decency Act. Basically, it protects publishers of information from the repercussions of distributing ideas created by another content provider. I’ll let you be the judge of whether or not repealing the act is a good idea. But to help you learn about it, here’s the [Wikipedia introduction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Section_230), [the law itself](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/47/230), and an explanation from the [_Federal Communications Commission_](https://www.fcc.gov/news-events/blog/2020/10/21/fccs-authority-interpret-section-230-communications-act)_._\n\n**​**[**The Unbearable Lightness of Being**](https://amzn.to/3mAHrRg)**:** Damn, what a magnificent book. The story isn’t very good, but only because it’s a canvas to explore the philosophy of love and the tensions of a life well-lived. This quote is a wonderful summary of what makes the book so magical: “The heaviest of burdens crushes us, we sink beneath it, it pins us to the ground. But … the heavier the burden, the closer our lives come to the earth, the more real and truthful they become. Conversely, the absolute absence of a burden causes a man to be lighter than air, to soar into the heights, take leave of the earth and his earthly being, and become only half real, his movements as free as they are insignificant.” Earlier this year, one of my favorite painters told me he‘ll never live a luxurious life because it’ll distance him from the human experience. Pain can be challenging, he said. But it can also magnify the experience of being alive.\n\n**The Psychology of Human Misjudgment:** This one is all the way on the opposite spectrum of life. Charlie Munger gave this speech at Harvard University in 1995. In it, he outlines shows how humans make bad decisions by drawing upon lessons from behavioral psychology. You can [read the full transcript](https://fs.blog/great-talks/psychology-human-misjudgment/) or [listen to the audio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqzcCfUglws&feature=emb_title).\n\n**​**[**Designing a New Old Home**](https://medium.com/@simon.sarris/designing-a-new-old-home-part-1-cf298b58ed41)**:** Simon Sarris is the best online writer I’ve found in the past few months. He writes with a level of soul that you rarely find on the Internet, which I aspire to whenever I tap my keyboard. This [two](https://medium.com/@simon.sarris/designing-a-new-old-home-part-1-cf298b58ed41) [part](https://medium.com/@simon.sarris/designing-a-new-old-home-part-2-2a5ea1a1b2b3) series outlines his thought-process behind designing a rural home in New Hampshire, from ceiling heights, to room sizes, to the carpets in the kitchen. On his recommendation, I’ve also been enjoying a book called [_Get Your House Right_](https://amzn.to/3rbj3t6)*,* which applies the wisdom of traditional architecture to modern living.\n\n[**Solitude and Leadership**](https://theamericanscholar.org/solitude-and-leadership/)**:** This speech is fantastic. It’s about why leaders need to spend time alone, even though most people think of solitude as the antithesis of leadership. It was delivered by William Deresiewicz at West Point. It’s as spiritual as it is insightful.\n\n**​**[**The Disadvantages of an Elite Education**](https://theamericanscholar.org/the-disadvantages-of-an-elite-education/)**:** I’ve always liked William Deresiewicz. I’ve recommended his *[Solitude and Leadership](https://theamericanscholar.org/solitude-and-leadership/)* essay, but he’s at his best while writing about higher education. He spent two dozen years at Yale and Columbia, where he dissected the psychology of elite students. Though almost every American student wants to attend an Ivy League school, this essay highlights the drawbacks of doing so, and he does it with awe-inducing prose.\n\n**​**[**On Re-doing Things**](https://ava.substack.com/p/on-redoing-things)**:** [Kevin Kelly](https://www.perell.com/podcast/kevin-kelly-seeing-the-future) once said: “To make something good, just do it. To make something great, just re-do it, re-do it, re-do it. The secret to making fine things is in remaking them.” The essay explores this idea in a kind of soul-driven fashion that you rarely see on the Internet. It made me realize that heart-wrenching creative work is driven by two forces: the desire to produce and the pain of actually doing it, and only once the thirst of desire is stronger than the anguish of hard work can you do great work.\n\n**Roger Scruton:** One of the leading conservative thinkers died, and I knew almost nothing about him. I wanted to change that, so I spent time watching Roger Scruton’s interviews. In particular, I enjoyed this [video interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omAvX8hGX0Y) and [this written summary](https://www.spiked-online.com/2015/12/10/these-left-thinkers-have-destroyed-the-intellectual-life/).\n\n[**Mimetic Theory**](https://www.reddit.com/r/ThePortal/comments/cfmtq2/comment/euiv3op?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x)**:** This is an unbelievable explanation of Mimetic Theory, and it’s probably the best one I’ve ever seen. The theory was developed by Rene Girard, a cultural anthropologist who history will remember as one of the greatest scholars of all-time. If you’re looking for a video summary, I recommend this [series of five interviews](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8Y8dVVV4To) with Girard himself. Peter Thiel and Girard were close friends. Thiel spoke at Girard’s funeral, and I wrote extensively about the influence of Mimetic Theory on Thiel’s worldview in [this essay](https://perell.com/essay/peter-thiel).\n\n[**John David Ebert**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXeMt9lyRFY)**:** Ebert is a brilliant orator, with a rich understanding of observant, but under-the-radar thinkers like Marshall McLuhan and Oswald Spengler. Ebert’s work is a fusion of religious studies, media studies, and contemporary philosophy. Start with [this serious of videos on Marshall McLuhan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXeMt9lyRFY). And if they catch you, check out [Ebert’s collection of published books](https://amzn.to/2vxEfky).\n\n**Interfluidity:** This is an obscure but fantastic blog. It sits at the intersection of government, economics, and technology. In particular, I enjoyed this essay called [_Economic Geography of a Universal Basic Income_](https://www.interfluidity.com/v2/6674.html)*,* which argues against the economic consensus that we should help as many people move to cities as possible. To date, it’s the best counter-argument I have seen against my essay, [_Grow the Merry-Go-Round_](https://perell.com/essay/grow-the-merry-go-round)_._\n\n**[Antonin Scalia on American Exceptionalism](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ggz_gd--UO0&feature=youtu.be):** Scalia’s opening remarks on the Role of Judges under the U.S Constitution. In his remarks, Scalia discusses the importance of grid lock and distributed power in government.\n\n**[The Liquid Self:](https://web.archive.org/web/20210227105833/https://www.snap.com/en-US/news/post/the-liquid-self/)** A prescient essay from 2013 which predicted the shift in identity brought by the Internet. It re-thinks the permanence of the social media profile and imagines the possibility of a living, fluid, and always changing identity made possible by the Internet. The post used to live on [Snapchat’s website.](https://web.archive.org/web/20210227105833/https://www.snap.com/en-US/news/post/the-liquid-self/) If you’re interested in Evan Spiegel’s early thinking, I also recommend [this 4-minute video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykGXIQAHLnA) about social media culture and online communication.\n\n[**The Electricity Metaphor**](https://www.ted.com/talks/jeff_bezos_the_electricity_metaphor_for_the_web_s_future/transcript?language=en): I’m surprised that this 2007 TED talk is so rarely shared. In it, Jeff Bezos uses electricity as a metaphor for the Internet’s future by comparing the dot-com boom and bust not to the Gold Rush, but to the early days of the power industry.\n\n**​**[**Christopher Hitchens Interview**](https://www.pdxmonthly.com/news-and-city-life/2009/12/christopher-hitchens)**:** This one is a conversation between a unitarian minister and the atheist philosopher Christopher Hitchens. It’s worth reading, partially because it’s so awkward. The conversation cuts to one of the core questions of modern religious thinking: should you think about religious stories literally or metaphorically? And if you treat them metaphorically, are you really religious?\n\n[**Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy**](https://plato.stanford.edu/contents.html): This is my go-to resource for everything philosophy. It’s like a better philosophy-focused Wikipedia with more information than you’ll ever be able to consume about the major ideas and thinkers. Fair warning… if you like philosophy, this is a black hole.\n\n**​**[**The Problem with Human Rights**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhRBsJYWR8Q)**:** Trigger warning: this video might shatter your worldview. At least, it did for me. The substrate of human rights rests on Judeo-Christian theology, and in particular the idea of *imago dei* (every human is made in the image of God), which is one of the biggest reasons I’ve been drawn towards faith. So with that, take a big ol’ swig of water and confront this red pill.\n\n**​**[**Postscript on Societies of Control**](https://www.jstor.org/stable/778828?seq=1%20)**:** In this short essay, Gilles Deleuze argues that modernity has been characterized by three stages: (1) before Napoleon, we lived in societies of sovereignty, (2) after World War II, we lived in societies of discipline, and (3) we’re now moving into a society of control. The essay anticipated many modern developments, such as the ability for big technology companies to shape speech and behavior without ordinary people realizing how strongly they’re being controlled. Before reading, [here’s a summary](https://twitter.com/jeremygiffon/status/1232800033336176647?s=20).\n\n[**Based Deleuze**](https://theotherlifenow.com/based-deleuze/)**:** Justin Murphy published a book called *Based Deleuze,* about a philosopher named [Gilles Deleuze](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilles_Deleuze), who history will remember as one of the most influential philosophers of the 20th century. Depending on the tier you choose, the book comes with a series of lectures from Justin himself. I recommend Murphy’s [introduction](https://twitter.com/jmrphy/status/1211019550633943044?s=20) because Deleuze is notoriously difficult you understand (you know, those French philosophers), and his talks will help you ease into the material. If you’re interested in philosophy, you might also enjoy Johannes Achill Niederhauser’s [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDsQqlrzoc-K32DE-Wh-roA) about classical philosophy.\n\n[**The Nuclear Family**](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2020/03/the-nuclear-family-was-a-mistake/605536/)**:** If you read one link, this should be it. It’s an exceptional explanation of why big families aren’t as common as they used to be. Many of the major political battles, such as free healthcare and universal basic income, are downstream from the changes in family structure that author David Brooks describes in this article.\n\n[**Justin Murphy**](https://jmrphy.net/)**:** I’m wildly impressed with this up-and-coming philosopher. Murphy’s work is a reaction to the intellectual claustrophobia of academia. I can say with 100% certainty that you won’t agree with all his ideas. Nevertheless, I admire his intellectual courage, so I hope more philosophers can use the Internet to pursue fringe ideas that need to be discussed. Start with his [podcast](https://jmrphy.libsyn.com/), his [Twitter](https://twitter.com/jmrphy?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor) account, or his [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfrlXVXz-pT9AmmDELhpyOw).\n\n**Aaron Lewis:** When it comes to the intersection of technology, culture, and society, this guy is one of the most under-rated thinkers out there. In particular, I recommend his articles on [post-truth in the age of the Internet](https://aaronzlewis.com/blog/2019/05/29/you-can-handle-the-post-truth/), and [writing pseudonymously on the Internet](https://aaronzlewis.com/blog/2020/02/18/being-your-selves-identity-r-and-d-on-the-pseudonymous-internet/).\n\n[**Battling to the End**](https://medium.com/@ryanpflynn/ren%C3%A9-girard-battling-to-the-end-quotes-891b535b43ed)**:** If you’re interested in Rene Girard, start with his interviews instead of his books. This heuristic applies to many great thinkers who are hard to understand because people tend to be easier to understand in spoken word than text. Here’s a [collection of quotes from *Battling to the End*](https://medium.com/@ryanpflynn/ren%C3%A9-girard-battling-to-the-end-quotes-891b535b43ed)*,* a series of conversations about the apocalyptic threats hanging over our planet and the mimetic laws of violence.\n\n[**Generic Drugs**](https://peterattiamd.com/katherineeban/)**:** A fascinating podcast with Peter Attia and Katherine Eban discussing widespread fraud in the generic drug industry. Attia hosts one of my favorite podcasts. Eban is an investigative journalist and the author of Bottle of Lies, which outlines the history of corruption in the generic drugs industry through the lens of an Indian drug company named Ranbaxy. This episode is an absolute roller-coaster.\n\n​[**The Moral Equivalent of War**](https://www.uky.edu/~eushe2/Pajares/moral.html)**:** An 1906 essay from William James where he argues society needs a way to re-create the strengthening, hardening, and uniting factors that war provides. Without a “moral equivalent of war,” our society will degenerate. The essay inspired a number of American service programs like the Peace Corps, VISTA, and AmeriCorps. If you resonate with the essay, I recommend [_Tribe_](https://amzn.to/3ChNkMp) by Sebastian Junger.\n\n[**Nassim Taleb’s Book Reviews**](https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AHMHNR4MRTDLMBOOT6Q7LX2WP5YA/ref=cm_cr_srp_mb_gw_top?ie=UTF8%20)**:** If you’re looking for book recommendations, I recommend Nassim Taleb’s book reviews on Amazon. If you’re interested in evolution, investing, or statistics, this page is for you. Of all the books, [_Explaining Social Behavior_](https://amzn.to/2XLVcUr)caught my attention the most.\n\n**Eric Weinstein’s Old Edge Articles:** First, I need to make sure you’re familiar with Eric Weinstein’s podcast, [_The Portal_](https://zoom.us/j/619662575)*.* If not, stop what you’re doing and start listening as soon as you can. I recommend the [opening episode with Peter Thiel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nM9f0W2KD5s) or his conversation with [Anna Khackiyan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gs8NGrWs3mc). But I also recommend the articles Eric wrote for Edge magazine. You’ll [find all the articles here.](https://www.edge.org/memberbio/eric_r_weinstein) I recommend this article on [excellence](https://www.edge.org/response-detail/23879) or this one about [string theory](https://www.edge.org/response-detail/25547).\n\n[**Seeking Wisdom**](https://amzn.to/34IlEQb)**:** Peter Bevelin is one of the most under-rated authors there is. His book [_Seeking Wisdom_](https://amzn.to/2XLVcUr)was one of the first books that made me realize how little I knew about the world. Building off the ideas of people like Charles Darwin and Charlie Munger, it shocked me into intellectual curiosity. If this is your kind of thing, I recommend a 75-minute speech by Charlie Munger called [_The Psychology of Human Misjudgement_](https://fs.blog/great-talks/psychology-human-misjudgment/) which I listened to on repeat all week.\n\n[**Cuck Philosophy**](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSkzHxIcfoEr69MWBdo0ppg)**:** This YouTube channel is a collection of 10-20 minute videos about different aspects of postmodernist theory. Start with [this video about Baudrillard and *The Matrix*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bf9J35yzM3E)or [this one about societies of control.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_i8_WuyqAY)\n\n[**Jose Ricon**](https://nintil.com/on-building/)**:** This is one of the most under-rated blogs I know. Jose writes about the intersection of science and technology with more thoroughness as anybody I know. Imagine if all journalism was this good. To start, I recommend his deep-dives into [longevity](https://nintil.com/longevity/), [the slowdown in physics](https://nintil.com/is-useful-physics-over/), and [Bloom’s two-sigma problem for mastery learning](https://nintil.com/bloom-sigma/). This blog will make you say “I can’t believe this is free.”\n\n[**Jacobin Magazine**](https://www.jacobinmag.com/)**:** On my journey to engage with Marx’s ideas, one of my most conservative friends turned me onto this socialist magazine covering economics, culture, and politics. It’s excellent. I enjoyed [this essay](https://jacobinmag.com/2020/04/precarity-french-labor-market-gig-economy-precariat) on the history of the gig economy and its influence on the French labor market.\n\n**Roger Scruton:** When one of the leading conservative thinkers died, and I knew almost nothing about him. I wanted to change that. As Nassim Taleb [wrote](https://twitter.com/nntaleb/status/1216461130253656064?lang=en): “Rest in Peace, Roger Scruton. Your memory and your work will be remembered. *Ad vitam aeternam.* Fiercely independent, he was one of the last thinkers who used their own head.” Of everything he’s published, I think he’s best while talking about beauty, and [I recommend his documentary on the subject](https://vimeo.com/128428182). BBC took it down because it didn’t stand with their values, so the only available version is pirated and has Portuguese subtitles. Of course, this is how you know it’s a great documentary. He also has a short book called [_Beauty_](https://amzn.to/3H4XBN0)*.* For an introduction, I also recommend [this 11-minute video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qFi0rMYuYsA) on why modern culture is degenerating and [this essay](https://www.roger-scruton.com/homepage/about/music/understanding-music/175-the-cultural-significance-of-pop) on the cultural significance of pop music.\n\n**Breaking Smart:** Venkatesh Rao is brilliant and this is his best piece of work. With only eight reviews on Amazon, it’s the ultimate hidden gem. The book is about how “software is eating the world,” and it includes topics like the dismantling of the traditional life script and the evolution of online work. You can [purchase the book on Kindle](https://amzn.to/2YoT59i) or [read the entire thing for free online](https://breakingsmart.com/en/season-1/). These ideas are a decade ahead of their time.\n\n[**David Harvey**](http://davidharvey.org/reading-capital/): This is the best introduction to Karl Marx I’ve found. I binge-listened to the [_Reading Capital_](http://davidharvey.org/reading-capital/)podcast series and bought Harvey’s book, [_A Companion to Capital_](https://amzn.to/2T4cUQ7). They are both fantastic. The problem with studying Marx is most modern scholars twist his ideas into a political agenda. But Harvey does none of that. He focuses on the text instead. If you want to read Marx, you can visit [Marxists.org](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/) instead of buying his books.\n\n**Horseshoe Theory**: I see this idea everywhere. Extreme opposites have a tendency to look the same. For example, a far-right movement and a far-left movement can be equally violent or desire a similar outcome. People on both sides are more similar to each other than they are to people in the center. [Here’s a summary](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Horseshoe_theory).\n\n**Common Knowledge**: One of the most important ideas I know. Often, it’s not enough for one person to know something. The dynamics of a situation change when everybody knows that everybody knows something. That’s why sermons are repetitive and often have a call-and-response style. Read [_Ads Don’t Work that Way_](https://meltingasphalt.com/ads-dont-work-that-way/)if you want something quick or [_Rational Ritual_](https://amzn.to/3duu4Oi) if you want a book-length treatment of the idea.\n\n[**Tools for Conversation**](http://a9.io/glue-comic/)**:** A fun and very detailed re-imagination of what chat messaging should look like. Basically, the structure of modern messaging platforms doesn’t reflect the way the brain works or the way people engage with ideas in real life.\n\n[**Google Platforms Rant**](https://gist.github.com/chitchcock/1281611)**:** This might be the most famous memo in recent Silicon Valley history. It was written by a Google engineer named [Steve Yegge](https://steve-yegge.medium.com/). Focusing on the differences between Google and Amazon (where he used to work), the memo was supposed to be shared internally, but it accidentally leaked.\n\n**​**[**Oil Industry Propaganda**](https://mashable.com/feature/carbon-footprint-pr-campaign-sham/)**:** The idea of a “personal carbon footprint” may have come from a 2005 marketing campaign from British Petroleum, which was designed to deflect responsibility away from corporations and onto consumers. For more, here’s a [short history](https://mashable.com/feature/carbon-footprint-pr-campaign-sham/) and [here’s a](https://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/14/opinion/14kenney.html) ​[New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/14/opinion/14kenney.html) opinion piece written by a guy who worked on the advertising campaign. For more on the subject of propaganda, I recommend a documentary called [The Century of the Self.](https://youtu.be/DnPmg0R1M04)\n\n[**Predicting Horse Races**](https://ma.tt/2017/11/adam-robinson-on-understanding/)**:** When it comes to predicting the future,too much information can be a bad thing. This transcript tells the story of a study done by a world-class psychologist named Paul Slovic in 1974 and shows how horse gamblers can deceive themselves as the amount of information increases. Substitute horse gamblers with investors and this article becomes even more interesting. (If you’re interested in predictions, check out [Dominic Cummings’ review of *Superforecasters*](https://dominiccummings.com/2016/11/24/a-review-of-tetlocks-superforecasting-2015/)).\n\n**OkCupid Dating Blog**: This blog is so interesting that most of the posts were deleted. Here’s the backstory: an online dating platform named OKCupid shared its best insights on online dating, and focused more on the data than political correctness. [Here’s a Reddit thread about the blog](https://www.reddit.com/r/gwern/comments/aapn1l/okcupid_blog_archives/). In particular, I recommend the articles about [people lying about their height](https://www.gwern.net/docs/psychology/okcupid/itseemsthatwomenlieabouttheirheightmorethanmendo.html) and [attractiveness distributions between men and women.](https://www.gwern.net/docs/psychology/okcupid/yourlooksandyourinbox.html)\n\n[**Seth Godin’s Blog**](https://seths.blog/top-100/): Nobody writes short articles better than Seth Godin. If you’re looking for something to read, start with his top 100 articles. They’re a masterclass in clear writing. You can also check out my interview with him [here.](https://perell.com/podcast/seth-godin-writing-every-day)\n\n[**The Love that Lays the Swale in Rows**](http://www.roughtype.com/?p=8783): Woah, what a fantastic essay. It’s an excerpt from the last chapter of Nicholas Carr’s book, [_The Glass Cage_](https://amzn.to/2TRAbox). To date, it’s the best argument I’ve seen against automation. The whole piece is thought-provoking, and the writing quality is the cherry on top.\n\n[**The Right to Useful Unemployment**](https://amzn.to/3cgHOLw): Every now and then, it is my duty to put Ivan Illych on your radar. He wrote in the 1970s, but his ideas still feel prescient. He argues that expertise and technology are Faustian Bargains — deals with the devil that destroy communities, tarnish mental health, and dehumanize people. You won’t necessarily agree with him, but his books will introduce you to critiques you won’t find elsewhere.\n\n[**A Critique of Stoicism**](https://medium.com/@simon.sarris/stoicism-is-not-enough-34181d34264c): Simon Sarris is one of my favorite up-and-coming Internet writers, and this essay is an excellent place to begin with his work. It’s a critique of Stoicism, using David Foster Wallace’s *[This is Water](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PhhC_N6Bm_s)* speech. Sarris’ essay is the best place to begin, but if you want to dive deeper down the Stoicism rabbit hole, [read this essay on the ethics of Stoicism](https://medium.com/1517/the-inadequacies-of-the-invincible-919e768f3106).\n\n[**Nassim Taleb Statistical Videos**](https://youtu.be/_ZLrZc9NPVw)**:** I’ll outsource this recommendation to some rando in the YouTube comments: “Taleb is the only guy who can make a 3-minute video, and get 30 minutes of watch time per video.” That’s exactly right. Start with [this 3-minute video on single point estimates in statistics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZLrZc9NPVw&feature=youtu.be), then [browse the entire channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8uY6yLP9BS4BUc9BSc0Jww).\n\n[**Johnathan Bi**](https://johnathanbi.com/book-notes-summaries): This guy is one of the best up-and-coming writers I know. He writes exceptional book summaries, such as this one on Alexis de Tocqueville’s [_Democracy in America_](https://johnathanbi.com/book-notes-summaries/democracy-in-america). If that’s not your style, I recommend this one on Rene Girard’s [_Battling to the End_](https://johnathanbi.com/book-notes-summaries/anfz349vjkgzm5kjq3tz6pdc7yhmc8) or this short one on Locke’s [_Second Treatise of Government_](https://johnathanbi.com/book-notes-summaries/second-treatise-of-government).\n\n**David Foster Wallace Interviews**: I devoured David Foster Wallace’s interviews, trying to understand why he’s the voice for a generation. His writing is exceptional, but also sad, depressing, and at times, mopey. History will remember him as one of the most iconic authors of the late 20th century. [Start with this unedited interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGLzWdT7vGc), which is as revealing as it is awkward. Then, watch his [interview with Charlie Rose](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GopJ1x7vK2Q). As you do, pay attention to his awareness of the moment and his obsession with what other people think of him.\n\n**Kevin Kwok:** I first met Kevin in New York City. After two hours of conversation over a cocktail, I called a friend and said “I just got drinks with one of the smartest people I’ve ever met.” I can confirm that’s true. I [hosted Kevin on the podcast](https://perell.com/podcast/kevin-kwok) six months later, and now I’m a passionate consumer of his ideas. In particular, I recommend his essays on the [origins of populism](https://kwokchain.com/2018/10/02/populism/), and [this one about Rich Barton](https://kwokchain.com/2019/04/09/making-uncommon-knowledge-common/), the founder of Expedia, Zillow, and Glassdoor.\n\n[**Fourth-World Country**](https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2019/04/08/weirding-diary-7/)**:** Everybody is familiar with the ideas of first-world, second-world, and third-world countries, but this short article describes a model for a fourth-world country. It shines a light on the social and economic distress people now feel in first-world countries.\n\n**Peter Turchin:** I can’t believe I just found this guy. I’ve only read one of his essays: [_Intra-Elite Competition: A Key Concept for Understanding the Dynamics of Complex Societies_](http://peterturchin.com/cliodynamica/intra-elite-competition-a-key-concept-for-understanding-the-dynamics-of-complex-societies/)*.* Phenomenal.\n\n[**How Long-Haul Trucking Works**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlPrAKtegFQ)**:** Supply chains impact all our lives, but they are mostly outside our field of view. Trucking moves the vast majority of the world’s freight, and 73% of America’s domestic freight. This video explains the economics of the industry, from driver salaries to truck stops on the highway. The video was made by an excellent channel called [Wendover Productions](https://www.youtube.com/user/Wendoverproductions). One of the commenters described it best: “Wendover is like a solar eclipse: He doesn’t come out often, but when he does it’s a treat.”\n\n[**Age of Abundance**](https://redef.com/original/age-of-abundance-how-the-content-explosion-will-invert-the-media-industry)**:** This article deserves way more attention. It was first published in 2016 by Tal Shachar ([here’s my podcast with him](https://perell.com/podcast/tal-shachar)), and so much of it has come true. For years, I used Tal’s essays as a roadmap for how the future would unfold. He predicted it with stunning accuracy. This essay focuses on the shift from information scarcity to abundance, and how it will invert the media industry.\n\n[**My Instagram**](https://nplusonemag.com/issue-36/essays/my-instagram/)**:** If you haven’t heard of [_n + 1_](https://nplusonemag.com/)magazine, it’s time to change that. Each of the long-form essays provides a window into modern culture with a writing style that reminds me of the [Paris Review](https://www.theparisreview.org/). This Instagram essay tells the story of the author’s evolving relationship with the platform, and how the world around her became optimized for the Instagram aesthetic.\n\n[**The Geopolitics of Oil**](https://warontherocks.com/2019/01/a-primer-on-the-geopolitics-of-oil/)**:** Word-for-word, this is the best introduction to the oil industry I’ve found. Though the article is about oil, I particularly enjoyed learning about copper production, which is concentrated in only four countries: Chile, Peru, China, and the United States. Collectively, they produce more than half of the world’s copper. Relative to oil, it can be easily stockpiled. And every year, the United States consumes 1.8 million tons of it, one-third of which is imported.\n\n**Awakening from the Meaning Crisis:** A thought-provoking [YouTube series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54l8_ewcOlY&list=PLND1JCRq8Vuh3f0P5qjrSdb5eC1ZfZwWJ) where John Vervaeke explores why modern citizens are so desperate for meaning in their lives. His premise is that we are in the midst of a mental health crisis, highlighted by increases in anxiety, despair, and depression. [Here’s a 3-minute introduction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ncd6q9uIEdw). If you’re just getting started, [here are some notes on the first episode](https://medium.com/@markmulvey/awakening-from-the-meaning-crisis-by-john-vervaeke-ep-1-summary-notes-ccfb6a0ebf46).\n\n[**Tradition is Smarter Than You Are**](http://scholars-stage.blogspot.com/2018/08/tradition-is-smarter-than-you-are.html)**:** As a general rule, the faster information flows, the less a society will value tradition, and today, information flows faster than ever. Our respect for the wisdom of our ancestors is further diminished by social media’s bias for the present, which I call the [Never-Ending Now](https://perell.com/essay/never-ending-now). But tradition is often a strategy for helping culture survive over long periods of time, even though the people within it are short-term oriented. [This article](http://scholars-stage.blogspot.com/2018/08/tradition-is-smarter-than-you-are.html) does a superb job of explaining the now-forgotten value of tradition.\n\n**David Foster Wallace:** I’ve been whirling down the David Foster Wallace rabbit hole, and it’s showing no signs of stopping. At the big-picture level, I find his novels too sprawling and hard to follow. But his interviews are fantastic. To begin, I recommend [this book of five interviews](https://amzn.to/37tym8k) he conducted towards the end of his life and [this article](https://digboston.com/excerpt-the-writing-life-of-david-foster-wallace/) about his writing process (excerpted from a book called [_Process: The Writing Lives of Great Authors_](https://amzn.to/37wm6Ur)).\n\n[**The Geopolitics of the United States**](https://worldview.stratfor.com/article/geopolitics-united-states-part-1-inevitable-empire): A superb two-part series on America’s geography and how it shapes the country’s politics. The USA has a lot of structural advantages. For example, it has a big ocean on both sides of the country, the world’s largest contiguous piece of farmland, more major ports than the rest of the Western hemisphere, and more navigable internal waterways than the rest of the world combined.\n\n[**In Praise of Idleness**](https://harpers.org/archive/1932/10/in-praise-of-idleness/): A 1932 essay from Bertrand Russell where he talks about the cult of workaholism, and what we should do to avoid it. He talks about the problems with seeing hard work as inherently virtuous, and how our obsession with hard work leads to a concept for stillness. Here’s a [summary from Maria Popova](https://www.brainpickings.org/2018/12/27/in-praise-of-idleness-bertrand-russell/).\n\n[**Webster’s 1913 Dictionary**](https://www.websters1913.com/)**:** Write with a better dictionary. Modern dictionaries have lazy definitions that focus too much on simplicity at the cost of precision. Instead of using the default one on your computer, [bookmark this site](https://www.websters1913.com/), and start using the Webster’s 1913 dictionary. Alternatively, you can download it for your Kindle or computer [with this link](https://jonathanbuys.com/Setting_Up_Webster's_Dictionary/).\n\n[**Netflix**](https://www.matthewball.vc/all/netflixbudget)**:** An 8-part essay series about Netflix from [Matthew Ball](https://www.matthewball.vc/netflix), who is the best big media analyst I know. Every essay in the series covers a different aspect of how people misunderstand the company. Topics include the company’s content budget, their product & technology stack, how they think about scale, the paradox of the original series term, and how bond markets or cash losses will shape their future.\n\n[**The Utopia of Rules**](https://amzn.to/2Cq1xMA): David Graeber is one of those authors who is often wrong, but always interesting. [In this interview](http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/mar/21/books-interview-david-graeber-the-utopia-of-rules), Graeber talks about how society has squeezed the eccentrics out of institutions, homogenized academia, and invented drugs to cope with bureaucracy’s tedious, all-consuming sprawl.\n\n[**Alice Schroeder on Warren Buffett**](http://seekingalpha.com/article/235292-behind-the-scenes-with-buffett-s-biographer-alice-schroederv)**:** An illuminating interview with Warren Buffet’s biographer. I particularly enjoyed this quote: “He’s cautious and non-confrontational. He’s wary of extremes in all forms. He’s insistently reluctant to criticize anyone and hypersensitive to criticism himself. He needs to be liked and needs approval, but paradoxically is not a people-pleaser.” The best parts were about his relationships and hyper-awareness of risk.\n\n\\***\\*[**My Struggle**](https://amzn.to/3ggu49x)**:**\\*\\*** We’ll close with a couple of books. First, we’ll start with the first volume in a 6-part series by Karl Ove Knausgaard. I picked it up in San Francisco on the recommendation of two friends, who both rated it among the best memoirs they’ve ever read. I also enjoyed the [author’s interview with Tyler Cowen](https://conversationswithtyler.com/episodes/karl-ove-knausgard/), who called him one of “the great writers of our civilization.” If you read nothing else, I recommend the first four pages about death. My goodness, they’re well-written. They’re anchored by this (now famous) opening string: “For the heart, life is simple: it beats for as long as it can. Then it stops.“\n\n[**Definite Optimism as Human Capital**](https://danwang.co/definite-optimism-as-human-capital/)**:** This is one of my all-time favorite online essays. In it, Dan Wang makes the case that optimism is a goal worth striving for. He suggests we do that by gaining a greater appreciation for industry, extending the technological frontier, and the benefits of economic growth. Ideas from this essay are sprinkled throughout [my 15,000-word essay about Peter Thiel](https://perell.com/essay/peter-thiel).\n\n[**George Soros’ Theory**](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XCK265X/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1)**:** One of the most successful investors of the 20th century laid out his Karl Popper inspired investment philosophy in a series of lectures about the [Open Society](https://www.philanthropydaily.com/george-soros-karl-popper-and-the-ironies-of-the-open-society/), reflexivity, capitalism, and the financial crisis.\n\n**Bryson DeChambeau:** During my freshman year of high school, I played in a golf tournament in Fresno and watched Bryson his balls on the range next to me. I had never seen a golfer swing a club so smoothly. From the instant I saw him play, I knew he would turn pro. Today, he is the 7th ranked golfer in the world. He also hits the ball farther than any other golfer on the PGA Tour. Most impressive of all, he’s climbed up the world golf rankings with a tactful fitness regimen and on-course strategy. His rise to stardom is one of the most interesting stories in the sports world. For more, I recommend this [Golf Digest article](https://www.golfdigest.com/story/the-zealot-bryson-dechambeau), this [interview with his swing coach Chris Como](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aeTZTMSZcw), and [this interview about his off-season fitness regimen](https://youtu.be/_F1H0Td7pxs). People call him “The Golf Scientist.” Even if you aren’t a golfer, there’s a lot to learn from him. His rise should be a much bigger story.\n\n[**Music and Burial in Human Evolution**](http://www.meltingasphalt.com/music-in-human-evolution/)**:** If you aren’t familiar with Kevin Simler’s writing, it’s time to change that. He writes at the intersection of anthropology, psychology, and evolution. His entire archive is worth reading but I recommend this essay on music in particular. Humans are the only ground-dwelling species that sings (the others like birds, gibbons, dolphins, whales, and seals sing from water or the air). Of all the animals that sing, humans are the only ones that use rhythm. This essay explores why.\n\n[**Envy**](http://falkenblog.blogspot.com/2020/01/helmut-schoecks-envy.html)**:** A summary of Helmut Schoeck’s [_Envy_](https://amzn.to/2Xh9cEH)*,* which was first published in 1966. The emotion comes from our animalistic, status-seeking nature, but it’s under-studied because it’s such a taboo emotion.\n\n**Andrew Kortina:** One of my new favorite essayists. I recently read his article called [_Virtualization, Forklifts, Microphones, Shipping Containers, Video Conferencing, Stethoscopes_](https://kortina.nyc/essays/virtualization-forklifts-microphones-shipping-containers-video-conferencing-stethoscopes/)*.* In it, the author talks about the acceleration of certain kinds of technological adoption because COVID created winners and losers in the economy. When it comes to the intersection of technology, labor, and automation, Kortina is one of the best writers I know. [Here’s his full essay archive](https://kortina.nyc/). You might like his essay [_Social Systems are Computations that Minimize Uncertainty._](https://kortina.nyc/essays/social-systems-are-computations-that-minimize-uncertainty/)\n\n[**Mark Zuckerberg Interview in 2005**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQWAVcyhsXc): “It’s essentially an online directory for students, where people can go and look up other people and find relevant information about them. Everything from what they’re interested in, to their contact information, what course they’re taking, who they know, who their friends are, what people say about them, and what photos they have now. It’s mostly a utility for people to figure out what’s going on in their lives and in their friends’ lives, for people they care about.”\n\n[**My Life Pouring Concrete**](https://quillette.com/2020/08/02/my-life-pouring-concrete/)**:** One man’s haunting perspective on the construction industry, which he says is plagued by alcoholism and opioid addiction. This quote stuck out: “Most of the men I worked with had little formal education. Many had a criminal record. Men working in construction and extraction have the highest suicide rate of any industry, as well as the highest rate of opioid addiction and (predictably) overdoses. Alcoholism rates are second only to the mining industry.” [An excellent read, even if it’s a difficult one.](https://quillette.com/2020/08/02/my-life-pouring-concrete/)\n\n**Plato’s Views on Education:** I read Book 7 of [_The Republic_](https://amzn.to/3fXZQ76)by Plato and wanted to dive deeper into his philosophy of education. At the childhood level, he believed in a free approach to learning. As he famously wrote: “Knowledge which is acquired under compulsion has no hold on the mind. Therefore, do not use compulsion, but let early education be rather a sort of amusement; this will better enable you to find out the natural bent of the child.” For a detailed summary, I [recommend this excellent Quora answer](https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-ideas-of-Plato-on-education).\n\n[**The Closing of the American Mind**](https://amzn.to/3iEb9mT)**:** This book is worth returning to, in part because it was one of the best-selling books in America in 1987. It remains as controversial today as it was when it was published. But the author Alan Bloom isn’t a shmuck. He wrote one of the canonical translations for [_The Republic_](https://amzn.to/3fXZQ76) ([free PDF here](https://mvlindsey.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/allen-bloom-the-republic.pdf)) and studied under Leo Strauss too. Since this was so popular, there are excellent analyses of it too. For a written one, I recommend this [praise-filled article in the *American Conservative*](https://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/the-american-mind-is-as-closed-as-ever/)or this [critique in *Rolling Stone*](https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-news/bloom-and-doom-the-closing-of-the-american-mind-85999/). Or, if you prefer audio, [here’s a one-hour summary](https://bradharris.com/the-closing-of-the-american-mind-by-allan-bloom/).\n\n**Adam Curtis:** The creator of one of my favorite documentaries, [_The Century of the Self (full transcript here)_](http://aireform.com/wp-content/uploads/20160219cpy..-Century-of-the-Self-Transcript-4-part-film-series-by-A.Curtis-55p.pdf)*.* It’s about the intersection of psychology and consumerism and builds upon the ideas of Sigmund Freud (who shaped modern psychology) and Edward Bernays (who founded public relations). As a member of the BBC staff in the 1980s and 90s, he’s created a bunch of other documentaries too.\n\n[**David McCollough Interview**](https://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/894/the-art-of-biography-no-2-david-mccullough)**:** One of my all-time favorite interviews with one of the great American biographers. My father read his book about the [Wright Brothers](https://amzn.to/3l8fBwk) and said it was superb. The Pulitzer Prize award winner has also written books about [John Adams](https://amzn.to/3aJQ9s6), [Harry Truman](https://amzn.to/31iEo8R), and [The Brooklyn Bridge](https://amzn.to/31h7pSh). Not a single one of his books has ever gone out of print. I actually haven’t read any of them yet, so [I can only recommend this excellent interview](https://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/894/the-art-of-biography-no-2-david-mccullough).\n\n**Robert Kurson:** Woah. His books are non-fiction narratives at their best. [_Rocket Men_](https://amzn.to/2Yo5UzV) is an excellent recounting of the Apollo 8 space mission where three astronauts flew around the moon. I was reading snippets from the book and enjoyed them so much that I immediately purchased another book of his: [_Shadow Divers_](https://amzn.to/2CLr2Zk)_._\n\n**Post Office:** Aaron Gordon wrote a [newsletter about the New York City subway system](https://signalproblems.substack.com/archive). After, he created [a newsletter about the United States Postal Service](https://themail.substack.com/). Gordon is at his best when he writes about bureaucracy, incentives, and organizational management. He nailed it with the subway system and to date, I haven’t found anybody who writes about those topics better. If you want to read about the NY subway system, [I recommend this article about “The Subway Action Plan.”](https://signalproblems.substack.com/p/the-subway-action-plan-is-not-whats)\n\n[**Academy of Ideas**](https://academyofideas.com/)**:** A series of short podcasts and [YouTube videos](https://www.youtube.com/user/academyofideas), with transcripts of every episode to make note-taking easy. In particular, I enjoyed this one about [Modern Art and the Decline of Civilization](https://academyofideas.com/2019/06/modern-art-decline-of-civilization/), which builds upon Nietzche’s [_Will to Power_](https://amzn.to/3ggSFar)and Nikolai Berdyaev’s [_The Meaning of History_](https://amzn.to/2Eml9Co)*,* which looks like an excellent book. I’ll remember Carl Jung’s quote that art is “the unwitting mouthpiece of the psychic secrets of \\[the\\] times.” Through their creations, artists give form to the underlying psychology of their culture.\n\n**Christianity:** Studying Christianity is one of the best ways to understand the West. I can’t believe I just discovered [Peter Kreeft](http://www.peterkreeft.com/featured-writing.htm). His website has in-depth articles about evidence for the [resurrection of Christ](http://www.peterkreeft.com/topics-more/resurrection-evidence.htm) and the [uniqueness of Christianity](http://www.peterkreeft.com/topics-more/christianity-uniqueness.htm). The friend who introduced me to Peter’s work is a Rene Girard scholar and he recommended [this introduction to Christianity](https://amzn.to/3hDRVO3) as the best book-length treatment of the subject.\n\n**Elena Shalneva:** We need a word for the sadness you feel after you’ve read everything an author’s ever published, and there’s nothing new left to explore. That’s exactly how I feel about Elena’s work. Start with this essay [In Defence of the Humanities](https://quillette.com/2020/07/14/in-defence-of-the-humanities/) or this one about [work as the tragedy of our age](https://quillette.com/2020/01/30/work-the-tragedy-of-our-age/).\n\n**​**[**Land of the Free**](http://im1776.com/2021/02/12/land-of-the-free/)**:** I love articles like this: sharp, witty, and fearless. Vibrant rhetoric inevitably follows from such a spiky point of view too. You’ll leave feeling a little dizzy, having passionately agreed or disagreed with so many of the author’s points. But you sure as hell won’t feel indifferent, and that’s what good writing is all about, eh?\n\n[**Why the West Needs Plato**](https://engelsbergideas.com/essays/leadership-in-crisis-why-the-west-needs-plato-more-than-ever/)**:** A good overview of Plato’s philosophy of government. He was skeptical of too much democracy, so he wanted society to be run by guardians who focused on long-term prosperity and weren’t influenced by the winds of culture. Too much democracy, he said, would give way to anarchy and tyranny.\n\n[**Julian Lehr**](https://julian.digital/2020/09/04/a-meta-layer-for-notes/)**:** One of the Internet’s best up-and-coming writers. [This essay](https://julian.digital/2020/09/04/a-meta-layer-for-notes/) is a critique of note-taking apps, inspired by Basecamp’s new Hey email product. He argues that the current paradigm of note-taking apps such as Evernote and Notion suffer from being stand-alone apps. Note-taking should be more spacial and should work more like an operating system for your life. Right now, there is too much context switching between apps.\n\n[**An Introduction to the Kelly Criterion**](https://nickyoder.com/kelly-criterion/)**:** A formula that calculates what percentage of your net worth you should wage in order to maximize your expected wealth increase. This quote explains why the formula is important: “A trader with mediocre strategy and a great risk model will become fairly successful. A trader with a great strategy and a mediocre risk model will become bankrupt.” I also enjoyed this one from Ed Seykota: “There are old traders, and there are bold traders. There are very few old, bold traders.” But the most interesting part of the article was learning that traders shouldn’t actually bet on the Kelly-optimal formula because the real world rarely has known probabilities and payoffs.\n\n**Athletes Don’t Down Their Tattoos:** Here’s an interesting question: Should athletes own the tattoos on their bodies? Some legal experts say that tattoos are technically owned by the tattoo artist, not the person with the actual tattoos. Some artists are suing video games that display their tattoos, such as the ones on LeBron James’ body. To avoid the commotion, some professional athletes now sign contracts with artists before the needle goes into their body. [Here’s a short introduction](https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2018/12/athletes-dont-tattoos.html).\n\n**Ted Polhemus:** An under-rated fashion theorist who writes about the sociology of the body and how we communicate with style. In particular, I recommend his articles on the relationship between [appearance and identity](http://www.tedpolhemus.com/main_concept2%20467.html) and why [body decoration makes us human](http://www.tedpolhemus.com/main_concept4%20467.html). If you’re feeling ambitious, he wrote a short book in 1978 called [_Fashion & Anti-Fashion_](https://amzn.to/33BjYIe)_._\n\n**WEIRD Societies:** Joseph Henrich is one of my favorite academics (here’s [my podcast interview](https://perell.com/podcast/joe-henrich-what-makes-society-smart) with him). I found him through his excellent book, *The Secret of Our Success*. More recently, he’s been studying WEIRD societies (the acronym stands for Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic). For more, I [recommend his talk at UBS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6e_5x4LQz8), his [2010 paper on WEIRD societies](http://hci.ucsd.edu/102b/readings/WeirdestPeople.pdf), or this article about the [Church’s influence on Western kinship](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/366/6466/eaau5141?ck_subscriber_id=344074356).\n\n[**It’s Charisma, Stupid**](http://www.paulgraham.com/charisma.html): An old article from Paul Graham, where he argues that the more charismatic candidate has won every election since 1964. Why? Television, which rewarded a different kind of presidential candidate. He cites an exception from the 1968 election but says it actually proves the rule because television debates were still evolving. Here’s a relevant data point from my [What the Hell is Going On essay](https://perell.com/essay/what-the-hell-is-going-on): “During the U.S. presidential election in 1968, the average soundbite—that is, any footage of a candidate speaking uninterrupted—was still a little more than 40 seconds, but that had fallen to less than 10 seconds at the end of the 80s and 7.8 seconds in 2000.”\n\n[**Oxford Very Short Introductions**](https://amzn.to/3j5jUHk): I worked through the founding articles of the United States and starting with this book about [the Constitution](https://amzn.to/2G9ExU2). It’s part of this excellent series of introductory books from Oxford. If you read nothing else but these books for three years, you’d be the smartest polymath in your entire social group. It’s not that exciting, but it’s an excellent learning strategy.\n\n[**McLuhan Galaxy**](https://mcluhangalaxy.wordpress.com/)**:** Marshall McLuhan is one of my all-time favorite writers, but he’s notoriously hard to read. Luckily, the folks at McLuhan Galaxy curate his ideas and put them into readable prose. Understanding his ideas is table stakes for understanding how the Internet is changing the world. But instead of reading his books, [start with this website](https://mcluhangalaxy.wordpress.com/).\n\n[**Why Be Jewish?**](https://amzn.to/30sTw2W)**:** I read this short book to prepare for my [interview with Rabbi David Wolpe](https://perell.com/podcast/rabbi-david-wolpe-jewish-wisdom). It’s written for people considering a return to the faith or people who are drawn to conversion, but it doubles as an [introduction to Jewish values](https://amzn.to/30sTw2W) for anybody interested in the subject. For a more secular treatment of the same idea, I recommend [Oxford’s short introduction to Judaism](https://amzn.to/34iDV74).\n\n[**Michael Nielsen’s Quotes Page**](https://mnielsen.github.io/notes/quotes/quotes.html)**:** This page is so good that it makes me jealous that I don’t have something similar. Michael Nielsen ([who I interviewed here](https://perell.com/podcast/michael-nielsen)) compiled his favorite quotes from people like Richard Feynman, Brian Eno, and Susan Sontag. Oh, and by the way, if you haven’t heard of Michael, it’s time to change that. Start with this essay about [developing transformative tools for thought](https://numinous.productions/ttft/).\n\n[**Oswald Spengler**](https://engelsbergideas.com/portraits/oswald-spengler-an-intellectual-life/)**:** One of the most under-rated philosophers out there. As an early 20th century writer, his work is a blend of Joseph Campbell, Martin Heidegger, and Ludwig Wittgenstein. His most famous book is called *The Decline of the West,* which hints at his pessimism about the future of civilization. For an introduction, I [recommend this short article](https://engelsbergideas.com/portraits/oswald-spengler-an-intellectual-life/) or [John David Ebert’s lecture series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCdi10nRhEw).\n\n[**In Praise of the Gods**](https://simonsarris.substack.com/p/in-praise-of-the-gods)**:** A soul-filled essay from Simon Sarris, where he critiques rationality as one of our most powerful tools, but also one of our worst excesses. The essay is an argument for post-rational wisdom and a more intuitive orientation towards the world. This is a masterpiece.\n\n[**Lee Kuan Yew Speech**](https://youtu.be/00KNtqv2gyQ)**:** Lee Kuan Yew served as the Prime Minister of Singapore from 1959 – 1990, and this is my favorite speech of his. It conveys a seriousness that the American government should learn from. This is my favorite quote: “I ignore polling as a method of government. I think that shows a certain weakness of mind, an inability to chart a course. Whichever way the wind blows. Whichever way the media encourages the people to go, you follow. You’re not a leader.”\n\n**Andrey Miroshnichenko:** I’m going to do something I rarely do and share a book I haven’t read. But this one is worth it. Miroshnichenko wrote one of my favorite books of all time: [_Human as Media_](https://amzn.to/2GGIYq3)*.* He’s a criminally under-rated media theorist, and on Tuesday, he messaged me to tell me about the launch of his new book: [_Postjournalism and the Death of Newspapers_](https://amzn.to/3lsczCo)_._\n\n[**Preference Falsification**](http://www.brucesabin.com/private_truths_public_lies.html)**:** One of my favorite ideas from Timur Kuran. It comes from a book called [_Public Truths, Private Lies_](https://amzn.to/31dLE5G)(here’s a [written summary](http://www.brucesabin.com/private_truths_public_lies.html) and [a podcast about it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzjqjU2FOwA)), where Kuran shows how people lie about their beliefs to look good in social situations. As Martin Luther King once said: “Many people fear nothing more terribly than to take a position which stands out sharply and clearly from the prevailing opinion. The tendency of most is to adopt a view that is so ambiguous that it will include everything and so popular that it will include everybody. Not a few men who cherish lofty and noble ideas hide them under a bushel for fear of being called different.” Once you learn about preference falsification, you’ll start seeing it everywhere. For more ideas like this, [here’s a list of 50 that shaped my worldview](https://perell.com/essay/50-ideas-that-changed-my-life).\n\n[**Mimetic Traps**](https://briantimar.github.io/notes/mimetic/mimetic)**:** This article belongs in the “everybody should read this category.” The author reflects on his experience in academia, where he was so focused on imitating his peers and pursuing competition that he ended up wasting his time on meaningless work.\n\n[**Reflections on Asperger’s Syndrome**](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/innovations/wp/2015/04/03/why-shades-of-aspergers-syndrome-are-the-secret-to-building-a-great-tech-company/)**:** [Peter Thiel](https://perell.com/essay/peter-thiel) has long condemned the modern world for making it so difficult for people to follow-through on original ideas that founders with Asperger’s account for the lion’s share of successful startups. Too strong a dose can obviously be crippling. People with Asperger’s are unemployed at rates that far exceed the general population. But a smaller dose may increase the chances of making a breakthrough innovation.\n\n[**The Sabbath**](https://amzn.to/3lTfILQ)**:** Rabbi David Wolpe strongly recommended this little book when I [interviewed him](https://perell.com/podcast/rabbi-david-wolpe-jewish-wisdom). It’s 100 pages, so you can read it all in one sitting. The writing is exquisite too. The author argues that we need the Sabbath to honor time because we spend the rest of our lives honoring space. We work in service of the grand, the concrete, and the magnificent, but only with the Sabbath do we honor the majesty of time.\n\n[**Loneliness and Totalitarianism**](https://aeon.co/essays/for-hannah-arendt-totalitarianism-is-rooted-in-loneliness)**:** Hannah Arendt is famous for her 1951 book, [_The Origins of Totalitarianism_](https://amzn.to/34qqP9b)*,* and this summary of her thoughts on loneliness as it pertains to totalitarianism is superb. In particular, I resonated with her distinction between loneliness and the state of simply being alone.\n\n[**The Ruthless Elimination of Hurry**](https://amzn.to/2TlD5RO)**:** I have such a love-hate relationship with this book. I can’t stand the writing. It’s written like an ultra-conversational blog post, which makes it hard to take it seriously. But some parts of the book are fantastic. It’s written by a Portland-based Christian pastor who makes a strong case for taking a weekly Sabbath and re-thinking our relationship with time. With that said, the people in my book club *loved* the book. One guy has already read it three times this year.\n\n**Fallibalism:** I discovered this idea in [_The Beginning of Infinity_](https://amzn.to/32CT4A7) by David Deutsch. It outlines a philosophy of constant learning and a consistent march towards truth. In addition to correcting your past mistakes, you aim to question the assumptions that everybody takes for granted. Or, as the Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy [defines it](https://iep.utm.edu/fallibil/): “Fallibilism is the epistemological thesis that no belief can ever be rationally supported or justified in a conclusive way. Always, there remains a possible doubt as to the truth of the belief.” To begin, I [recommend this quote from Deutsch](https://twitter.com/david_perell/status/1326016276964241408).\n\n**Pirsig’s Metaphysics of Quality:** Robert Pirsig is famous for a book called [_Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance_](https://amzn.to/3eXWy53). It’s an excellent book that has almost nothing to do with motorcycles. But instead of recommending the entire book, I’ll point you to his metaphysics of quality. In the book, he tries to define quality even though it precedes any intellectual description of it. Like beauty, it exists as a perceptual experience that words cannot describe. Start with the [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pirsig%27s_metaphysics_of_Quality) or [this *Philosophy Now* explainer](https://philosophynow.org/issues/122/Robert_Pirsig_and_His_Metaphysics_of_Quality).\n\n**Elite Overproduction:** Peter Turchin is one of America’s fastest up-and-coming social thinkers. He presents a grim picture of America’s future in his book, [_Ages of Discord_](https://amzn.to/32YN6tF)*.* Specifically, he blames “elite overproduction” for many of America’s challenges and argues that there’s a surplus of smart young Americans fighting for admission to elite colleges and graduates fighting for the same job slots. All that competition, he says, causes society to fracture and is one of the chief causes of political instability. In both cases, the number of people fighting for admission is rising much faster than the number of available slots. That’s partially why schooling and urban housing prices are rising so fast. For an explainer, I recommend [this *Atlantic* article](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2020/12/can-history-predict-future/616993/) or this [explainer from Bloomberg’s Noah Smith](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-07-06/the-rich-and-privileged-can-revolt-too).\n\n**The Enlightenment:** I’ve been studying the Enlightenment. [The Wikipedia page is superb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_Enlightenment) and introduced me to people like Cesare Beccaria, who condemned torture and the death penalty to become one of the founding thinkers in the field of criminology. Inspired in part by the article, I read [_The New Atlantis_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Atlantis) by Francis Bacon. For a different perspective on the Enlightenment, I recommend Johnathan Bi’s [masterful summary of *Dialectic of the Enlightenment*](https://johnathanbi.com/book-notes-summaries/the-dialectic-of-enlightenment), which is one of the most important works of philosophy to come out of the Frankfurt School.\n\n**Arthur Chandler:** There are few things I enjoy more than finding an ugly website with excellent information. It makes the information feel like a secret. Arthur Chandler is a professor at San Francisco State University. Though I recommend playing around on his website, you should start with this article on [Oswald Spengler’s morphology](http://www.arthurchandler.com/spengler-morphology) or this one about [Plato’s Cave](http://www.arthurchandler.com/platos-cave). You’ll also find ideas about style, mathematics, dance, photography, and technology.\n\n**Münchhausen Trilemma:** This idea comes from the world of epistemology. It shows the impossibility of proving any truth, even in the fields of logic and mathematics. Whenever somebody asks for further proof on an argument, there are only three places the speaker can fall back on: (1) the circular argument, in which the proof of some proposition is supported only by that proposition, (2) the regressive argument, where each argument requires further proof, and (3) the dogmatic argument, which rests on accepted principles which are merely asserted rather than defended. [Those definitions are from Wikipedia, which provides an excellent introduction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%BCnchhausen_trilemma).\n\n[**Peter Thiel and Garry Kasparov**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rOvEPYNEsc)**:** I’ve [written extensively about Peter Thiel](https://perell.com/essay/peter-thiel), and this is one of his [most insightful videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rOvEPYNEsc). In it, he speaks with chess champion Garry Kasparov about technology, chess, human rights, and the future of the global economy. I wish there were more videos like this of two smart people hanging out and having a casual conversation, beyond the standard interview format. For a preview of the full video, I [recommend this six-minute clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IjNd5RpN4Y).\n\n[**Century of the Self**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnPmg0R1M04)**:** A 2013 documentary about how people in power have used Sigmund Freud’s theories to control and manipulate crowds. It discusses the relationship between Freud and Edward Bernays, who was Freud’s nephew and the founder of the public relations industry. If you’re interested in advertising, narrative control, and crowd psychology, you will love this documentary.\n\n**Zena Hitz:** Hitz is a tutor at St. John’s College, which is famous for its Great Books program, and the author of one of my favorite recently published books called [_Lost in Thought: The Hidden Pleasures of an Intellectual Life_](https://amzn.to/33jlAqI)*.* Instead of diving straight into the book, I recommend her [interview with Russ Roberts](https://www.econtalk.org/zena-hitz-on-lost-in-thought/) or her essay called [_Freedom and the Intellectual Life_](https://www.firstthings.com/web-exclusives/2016/04/freedom-and-intellectual-life)*.* If you really want to fall down the rabbit hole, [she collected all her work here](https://zenahitz.net/).\n\n[**The Intellectual Life of the British Working Class**](https://amzn.to/3q5FHT2)**:** Hitz turned me onto this 550-page book. When we think of the classics, we usually think of academics and aristocrats. But this book shows how erudite the British working classes have historically been with stories about their passion for classic literature and philosophy. The book goes into more depth than I’d like, so I recommend either [this review](https://ceasefiremagazine.co.uk/the-intellectual-life-british-working-classes-jonathan-rose/) or [this one.](http://freerangereading.blogspot.com/2015/01/review-intellectual-life-of-british.html)\n\n**[Naval Ravikant Interviews Nassim Taleb](http://www.mrsideproject.com/2018/11/15/nassim-taleb-naval-ravikant-blockcon-2018/):** I’ve learned more from Nassim Taleb than just about anybody. His concepts are simple and timeless. Taleb draws from finance, philosophy, and statistics and wraps them together into his own, unique worldview. This interview is one of the best summaries I’ve seen of Taleb’s ideas. If you prefer to read an essay, I recommend [this article](https://www.edge.org/conversation/nassim_nicholas_taleb-the-fourth-quadrant-a-map-of-the-limits-of-statistics) and [this article.](https://www.edge.org/conversation/nassim_nicholas_taleb-understanding-is-a-poor-substitute-for-convexity-antifragility) Both excellent.\n\n**[Capitalism and Schizophrenia](https://genius.com/Jonah-peretti-capitalism-and-schizophrenia-annotated):** This is the best rabbit hole I’ve been down in a while. In the essay, Jonah Peretti, the founder of BuzzFeed laid out the theory behind his company years before he started it. His essay builds upon the work of Fredric Jameson, Jacques Lacan, Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari to present a new perspective on the relationship between identity and capitalism. The best explanation of Peretti’s essay comes from a [YouTube channel called Cuck Philosophy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9srhgHzUFd4). I also recommend this [background article from Vox.](https://www.vox.com/2014/5/20/5730762/buzzfeeds-founder-used-to-write-marxist-theory-and-it-explains)\n\n**[Reinventing Explanation](http://michaelnielsen.org/reinventing_explanation/index.html):** We forget how tools shape our thought. This essay explores how new media transforms thought and improves our understanding of the world. Through media, we can think the unthinkable. Consider a subway map. It’s a brilliant invention precisely because it distorts reality, but by distorting reality, maps that aren’t drawn to scale influence property values, business decisions, and transportation flows. [Here’s my interview with Michael Nielsen, the author.](http://perell.com/podcast/michael-nielsen)\n\n**​**[**Economics as a Moral Philosophy**](https://www.presentwitness.com/economics-as-a-moral-philosophy)**:** I‘ve always been annoyed with the idea that economics is a complete science. It isn’t. Humans are too unpredictable and the ideas break down too often. But in particular, everybody should know the basics of microeconomics. Though this article doubles as a critique of the discipline, I like the idea that economics is a value system that shapes our decision-making in ways that are so ingrained in society that they’re invisible to us.\n\n​[**Rethinking Economics**](https://amzn.to/2wZA8il)**:** I’m torn about the value of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) as a metric. On one hand, it’s highly correlated with happiness indices, and people like [Tyler Cowen](https://www.cato-unbound.org/2019/01/09/tyler-cowen/case-longer-term) have gracefully argued that we should pursue a strategy of maximizing sustainable GDP with a low discount rate in the future. With that said, the headstrong pursuit of GDP has perverse side effects for physical and emotional health. In the past 100 years, in America, we’ve seen the [decline of community](https://www.beyondintractability.org/bksum/putnam-bowling), the [death of the nuclear family](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2020/03/the-nuclear-family-was-a-mistake/605536/), and a country that is increasingly obese and diabetic.\n\n---\n\n## Business & Tech\n\n**​**[**Business Writing with Brie Wolfson**](https://koolaidfactory.com/writing-in-public-inside-your-company/)**:** How does remote work change the way companies get things done? Remote work leads to writing-centric companies instead of speaking-centric ones. Companies like Amazon and Stripe have already built writing-heavy cultures. As [Patio11](https://twitter.com/patio11) once said: “Stripe is a celebration of the written word which happens to be incorporated in the state of Delaware.” With that in mind, I asked Brie Wolfson (who worked at Stripe for ~5 years and led the creation of Stripe Press) to speak to my [Write of Passage](https://writeofpassage.school/) students about how organizations can create a culture of writing. Out of our conversations, she produced [this stellar guide.](https://koolaidfactory.com/writing-in-public-inside-your-company/)\n\n**Why Jeff Bezos Dropped Physics:** No matter how talented you are, your lack of genius in a particular area is often obvious. Jeff Bezos wanted to be a theoretical physicist. But one night, while studying quantum mechanics, he realized his brain wasn’t wired to process highly abstract concepts. Upon learning that he wasn’t smart enough to be a physicist, he switched to computer science. He tells the story in [this short and hilarious YouTube video](https://youtu.be/eFnV6EM-wzY).\n\n**​**[**Own the Demand**](https://florentcrivello.com/index.php/2018/10/22/own-the-demand/)**:** This piece has been tattooed in my brain ever since I discovered it. With the rise of the Internet, power in the economy shifted from people who controlled supply to people who owned demand. That’s why Bill Gurley, perhaps the most successful marketplace investor of all-time, once wrote: “A lesson I have learned many times in my 20 years as a marketplace investor is that aggregating demand is the one & only key.” The lesson is simple: Have a direct relationship with your customers. If somebody gets between you and your customer, your margins will fall as customer acquisition costs rise. One statistic stands out: Google pays ~$9 billion per year to Apple to be iOS’ default search engine.\n\n**Dan Wang’s Annual Letters:** If you want to learn about China, this is your guy. Every year, Dan writes an Annual Letter where he reflects on his on-the-ground observations from China. He’s unique because he’s lived in each of China’s main mega-regions. Most of his observations center around the intersection of culture and technology, but they stretch from classical music to industrial policy to how political decisions shape public opinion. Here are his letters from [2021](https://danwang.co/2021-letter/), [2020](https://danwang.co/2020-letter/), and [2019](https://danwang.co/2019-letter/).\n\n**​**[**Sumner Redstone**](https://neckar.substack.com/p/sumner-redstone-winning-above-all)**:** Wealth and success are cool, but not if you turn out like this. Redstone built a chain of successful movie theaters early in his career. At 56, he was almost burned alive in a fire. Out of his miraculous survival, he ramped up his ambitions and, after a hostile takeover, became the Chairman of Viacom. But his relentless lust for power fractured his family relationships. He’s gone to court against his brother, son, nephew, wife, and granddaughter.\n\n**​**[**CIA Field Sabotage Manual**](http://svn.cacert.org/CAcert/CAcert_Inc/Board/oss/oss_sabotage.html)**:** In 1944, the CIA released a guide on how to sabotage an organization, and I can’t shake the feeling that we’re voluntarily implementing these tactics today. They sound exactly like what happens in a corporate meeting: (1) insist on doing everything through channels, (2) haggle over people’s wordings, and (3) advocate “caution.”\n\n**​**[**The Idea Maze**](https://spark-public.s3.amazonaws.com/startup/lecture_slides/lecture5-market-wireframing-design.pdf)**:** This article from [Balaji Srinivasan](https://perell.com/podcast/balaji-srinivasan-living-in-the-future/) is a roadmap for entrepreneurs who want to turn an idea into a profitable business. It orbits around a concept called “The Idea Maze.” Great entrepreneurs don’t just have an idea. They have a bird’s eye view of the landscape. They’ve thought through various paths they can take their company and have an answer not just for why they’re choosing a specific path but also why they’ve rejected the alternatives. If you want to build a company, this article is for you.\n\n**​**[**How Instant Messenger Shapes Thinking:**](https://thebrowser.com/notes/lm-sacasas/) The most meta interview you’ll ever read because it’s an interview about instant messenger which takes place on instant messenger. The best part of the interview centered around writing as a technology for thinking, as opposed to speech. When we’re talking, we hop from thought to thought. But writing asks us to freeze our thoughts, which is why it’s such an effective way to improve your thinking. The lesson is simple: Writing is useful precisely because it’s difficult.\n\n**​**[**Trader Joe’s**](http://freakonomics.com/podcast/trader-joes/)**:** A primer on my favorite supermarket, which sells more food per square foot than any other grocery store. They don’t just have customers. They have fans. Visiting the store is a little bit like thrift shopping because you always find something unexpected. It seems like every other week somebody swells with pride as they recommend some new Trader Joe’s product to me. It’s far more curated than other grocery stores too. Where typical grocery stores carry ~35,000 SKUs (stock-keeping units), Trader Joe’s only has ~3,000. Roughly 80% of those products have the Trader Joe’s name on the label too. Unlike other grocery stores, there are employees everywhere, no social media, no self-checkout lines, no customer loyalty programs, and no online ordering.\n\n**​**[**Vibe Capitalism**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9xsWg4TNKY)**:** The original vision of Silicon Valley tech was that we could be so efficient that we could level up and nurture our humanity. But in truth, since efficiency has no end, we knocked the soul out of the Internet. As investor Geoff Lewis explains in this 20-minute talk: “Somewhere along the way to global domination, many of us in tech traded in the goal of the good life for an efficient life without even realizing it.”\n\n**​**[**Buffett’s Reading Obsession**](https://neckar.substack.com/p/the-reading-obsession)**:** Many people look at the way Warren Buffett reads 500 pages a day and try to do the same. The problem is that the things that made him successful on the way up aren’t the things that keep him successful now that he’s made it. This article goes into the things that made Buffett successful on the way up. He obsessed over the biographies of people he admired, interrogated executives to understand the mechanics of business, and hosted friends for a bi-annual conference in what eventually became known as “The Buffett Group.”\n\n**Urbit:** What if we could rebuild our computing infrastructure from scratch? What if a platform could guarantee privacy, allow people to customize their computing stack, and incentivize a computing environment where our emotions aren’t so manipulated? Though the vision is grand, the project is still in its early stages. And though it’s little more than a chat forum right now, this project has incredible energy around it — like Bitcoin in 2011. I recommend two introductions: [this formal one](https://urbit.org/blog/urbit-for-normies) and [this informal one](https://subject.network/posts/urbit-introduction/).To learn about the project’s philosophical underpinnings, I recommend [this essay about digital communities](https://urbit.org/blog/urbit-is-for-communities) and [this one about Christopher Alexander’s influence](https://urbit.org/blog/on-christopher-alexander).\n\n**The Theory of Constraints:** When I started [working with Tiago Forte](https://perell.com/podcast/tiago-forte-whats-next-in-education/), I learned how the Theory of Constraints shows up all over the place. For instance, my first introduction came through [this excellent multi-part series](https://fortelabs.co/blog/theory-of-constraints-101-table-of-contents/) about bottlenecks and supply chains. It’s essentially a summary of [_The Goal_](https://amzn.to/30RXwgm) by Eliyahu Goldratt (I recommend the audiobook). The theory provides an entry point to productivity, from personal tasks to global supply chains. To see how *The Theory of Constraints* is practically relevant, I recommend [this Twitter thread](https://threader.app/thread/1451543776992845834) about the Long Beach port and all the container ships camping out nearby. The idea that “you should always choose the most capital intensive part of the line to be your bottleneck” demands a deep think.\n\n**Eugene Wei:** To the extent that my work consists of betting on smart people, I’m happy to have been [the first person to host a podcast interview with Eugene.](https://www.eugenewei.com/blog/2018/1/10/my-first-podcast-appearance) He was one of the first people on Amazon’s finance team and led product at Hulu and video for Oculus at Facebook. He’s far more right-brained than the kinds of people I usually meet in Silicon Valley. For a short introduction to his thinking, I recommend this interview ,which builds upon his film background and love for movies. For something more in depth, I recommend [_Selfies as a Second Language_](https://www.eugenewei.com/blog/2017/9/14/selfies-as-a-second-language) or his [three-part essay series about TikTok’s success](https://www.eugenewei.com/blog/2020/9/18/seeing-like-an-algorithm).\n\n**​**[**How Narratives Drive Prices**](https://kwokchain.com/2021/09/29/narrative-distillation-1/)**:** The public markets increasingly resemble private ones in the way that revenue multiples continue to spread. Founders who can articulate their company’s vision and persuade the public markets that they have a bright future have cheap access to capital. Elon Musk and Tesla is the perfect example. The author writes: “Thus Tesla’s PE ratio is in many ways self-fulfilling. If Tesla could get people to extend the access to capital it needs for long enough, it will be successful. If it could not, then it would have collapsed. Ironically, this means that far from Elon’s antics being distracting, his ability to maintain these high PE ratios might be the most important driver of the company’s ability to succeed.” The better a company can tell its narrative, the cheaper it can access capital and the higher its price-to-earnings ratio can become.\n\n**​**[**Remystifying Supply Chains**](https://studio.ribbonfarm.com/p/remystifying-supply-chains)**:** Everybody’s life is shaped by supply chains, but few people understand them. Supply chains aren’t some distant phenomenon either. We live *inside of them.* They shape every aspect of our lives, from the computer you’re reading this on to the clothes you’re wearing. Here, Venkatesh Rao shows us how we should upgrade the analogies we use to think about supply chains. For a more practical look at supply chains, I also recommend a book summary called [_The Epic Story of Container Shipping_](https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2009/07/07/the-epic-story-of-container-shipping/)_._\n\n**​**[**Supporting Ambition**](https://www.strangeloopcanon.com/p/on-medici-and-thiel)**:** Receiving an [Emergent Ventures grant](https://perell.com/emergent-ventures/) was one of the most important moments of my career. Though it wasn’t a huge sum of cash, it was a giant stamp of approval that injected me with confidence. [Tyler Cowen](https://perell.com/podcast/tyler-cowen-production-function/), an economist at George Mason who runs the program, effectively said: “I love what you’re doing and I believe in you so much that I’m going to give you a stamp of approval.” Trivial as it may seem, it was game-changing for me. It made me believe in myself, and I used that grant money to fund the first [Write of Passage](https://writeofpassage.school/) cohort. This essay argues that we don’t have nearly enough grants like Emergent Ventures or the [Thiel Fellowship](https://perell.com/essay/peter-thiel/), and I strongly agree. Way too many talented young people are stuck in a prestige chase that traps them in trivial jobs. We need more people to take big risks and pursue their most ambitious ideas.\n\n​[**An Introduction to Thomas Sowell**](https://www.city-journal.org/thomas-sowell-race-poverty-culture)**:** An excellent introduction of Sowell’s work by Coleman Hughes. If you don’t know Sowell, he’s a Senior Fellow at Stanford University’s Hoover Institution. This essay tells the story of his life from growing up without electricity or hot water in North Carolina, to moving to Harlem in 1939, to receiving his Ph.D. in economics at the University of Chicago.\n\n**​**[**China’s Sputnik Moment**](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2021-07-29/chinas-sputnik-moment)**:** One of my favorite writers, Dan Wang, wrote about how the Chinese economy is changing. Its government has cracked down on consumer Internet companies and online education firms. Officials are turning their attention to controlling certain “chokepoint technologies.” Wang explains that the fallout from recent U.S trade restrictions unified the private sector’s profit motive with the Chinese government’s push for geopolitical power.\n\n**​**[**How to be an Effective Executive**](https://delian.io/lessons-3)**:** One of the best articles I’ve ever read about management. A few principles stand out: (1) Make decisions by knowledge rather than position as much as possible and at as low of a level as possible, and (2) Your output is how much your team gets done + how much neighboring teams get done divided by how many people are on your team. Only add someone if they bring up the ratio of output to people. Since all the ideas in this piece come from the [venture capitalist Keith Rabois](https://perell.com/podcast/keith-rabois/), they’re geared towards venture-backed companies in hyper-growth mode.\n\n**​**[**Interview with Patrick Collison**](https://noahpinion.substack.com/p/interview-patrick-collison-co-founder)**:** Of all the Silicon Valley CEOs, Patrick is the one I admire most. This interview is a whirlwind through his interests: biology, online business, technological progress, aviation, funding scientific research, energy, and culture. I don’t remember the last time I learned about so many new ideas in one sitting. Such a fun read.\n\n**Leaked Technology Emails:** One of my friends made an [astute observation](https://twitter.com/jeremygiffon/status/1408111798679650312?s=20) on Twitter: “The only business writing worth reading are leaked emails. Writing that was never meant to be a product is always closer to the truth.” Amen, brother. With that in mind, I’ve been enjoying [this Twitter account of leaked technology emails](https://twitter.com/TechEmails) (there’s a [Substack](https://techemails.substack.com/welcome) too). For starters, I liked [Steve Jobs’ executive team meeting agenda](https://twitter.com/TechEmails/status/1400208754659008519?s=20) from 2007 and [this email he sent to the CEO of Adobe in 2005](https://twitter.com/TechEmails/status/1407016788240576512?s=20).\n\n**​**[**Process Knowledge**](https://future.a16z.com/the-silicon-in-silicon-valley-again/)**:** The author Dan Wang is one of those essayists who continually inspires me to level up my craft. He’s one of the most learned people I know. One time, he spent an hour breaking down the structure of Chinese politics for me and some friends. It was so well done that if it had been public, it would have been a viral YouTube video. Anyways, this essay laments the decline of America’s manufacturing base. Specifically, through the lens of process knowledge which he defines as earned experience that can’t be written down. Beyond that, he paints a vision for Silicon Valley as a place where people give hardware manufacturing the respect it deserves.\n\n**​**[**The Story of TikTok**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xbnDay35L8I)**:** A conversation with two of the savviest product analysts I know: [Eugene Wei](https://perell.com/podcast/eugene/) and [Kevin Kwok](https://perell.com/podcast/kevin-kwok/). Both are previous podcast guests and Eugene has written three long-form essays about TikTok ([this is my favorite one](https://www.eugenewei.com/blog/2020/8/3/tiktok-and-the-sorting-hat)). If you’re interested in online creativity, Silicon Valley-style product building, and how social media is transforming, you’ll enjoy this 90-minute conversation.\n\n​[**Working Backwards**](https://amzn.to/3uOhqCC)**:** I’ve long been obsessed with Amazon’s business operations practices, and [besides this essay from Zack Kanter](https://zackkanter.com/2019/03/13/what-is-amazon/), this book is the best thing I’ve seen written about them. The two authors worked directly with Bezos, so [the book](https://amzn.to/3uOhqCC) is filled with one-liners like this: “Good intentions don’t work. Mechanisms do.” Long-term, you can’t solve problems by working more or trying harder. If you want persistent change, you have to fix the underlying system.\n\n**The Master Switch:** As Hollywood continues to lose influence, I want to explore the history of it so I can make sense of where the culture industry is going. [_The Master Switch_](https://amzn.to/3aOoJT1) is my favorite book on this subject, and it’s time for a re-read. The writing is dry but the ideas are excellent. The thesis is that information industries are defined by a cycle between periods of closed and open, centralization and decentralization. But it’s really a series of histories about information technologies like radio, television, and the movie industry. [Here’s a YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LVZLl4EKQis) the author gave about the book.\n\n**Debt:** You know me: I‘m always looking for radically independent thinkers who can shake my worldview. This week’s nominee is David Graeber. I bring him up today because my closest childhood friend, [Zander Nethercutt just wrote an essay](https://zander.substack.com/p/the-venmo-generation-is-over-the) about his seminal book*:* [_Debt_](https://amzn.to/3tJBd53)*.* Start there. Then, if Zander’s piece moves you to learn more about the book, I recommend this [summary from Alex Danco](https://alexdanco.com/2020/05/15/debt-the-first-5000-years/) or this one from a blog called [_Understanding Society_](https://understandingsociety.blogspot.com/2011/11/david-graebers-reflections-on-money.html)_._\n\n**Marshall McLuhan:** This newsletter only has one rule: You must be somewhat familiar with McLuhan’s ideas. They’re too important to ignore, and unlike most intellectuals, he’s a blast to listen to. He was a media theorist who did most of his work in the 60s and 70s. With that in mind, here’s my starter guide. If you want to read something, start with [_The Medium is the Massage_](https://amzn.to/3oz2rdS) or [_McLuhan Misunderstood_](https://amzn.to/3fFiNxD)*.* If you prefer to listen, you’ll like [this explainer from Terrance McKenna](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aljs5vlW2u4) or my conversation with his grandson (*Listen on* [_iTunes_](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-massage-presented-by-the-mcluhan-institute/id1524357056) *or* [_Spotify_](https://open.spotify.com/show/0TFoBS1vBUnvZ2tZrd6g68)).\n\n**Things to Hang on Your Mental Mug Tree**: When I study business, I look for authors who are also practitioners because their theories are filtered through the lens of experience. Rory Sutherland tops the list. I [interviewed him last year](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHbdFn9UyDY) and [summarized his ideas in an article too](https://perell.com/note/rory-sutherland/). I discovered his work in this top-notch interview, which is an [excellent introduction to his ideas](https://www.edge.org/conversation/rory_sutherland-things-to-hang-on-your-mental-mug-tree).\n\n**​**[**CodeMiko**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsQjxEd-gsw&t=2s)**:** Here’s a weird trip to the future. This video is about a professional Twitch streamer who has created a pseudonymous world for herself. She used Unreal Engine and the kind of motion capture suit they use to make video games to create a character for herself. One of the YouTube comments nailed it: Today, we live in a world where humans pretend to be digital avatars, but in the future, digital avatars will pretend to be human.\n\n**​**[**How McDonald’s Really Makes Money**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJVj3vp-lho)**:** The first YouTube comment summarizes this video better than I ever could: “Burger is their side business, charging rent is their cash cow.” In fact, with $39 billion in assets, McDonald’s is the 5th largest real estate company in the world.\n\n[**A Legendary Interview**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuvrZFJLXSk)**:** The YouTube algorithm usually does an outstanding job of recommending conversations with brilliant people in the public eye. But every now and then, there’s a glitch in the system. [This conversation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OuvrZFJLXSk) with Mark Zuckerberg, Patrick Collison, and Tyler Cowen deserves more than 8,000 views. Thanks to [Blake Robbins](https://twitter.com/blakeir/status/1362497110504046593) for the pointer.\n\n​[**Amazon Logistics**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qanMpnYsjk)**:** A tour through Amazon’s mind-bogglingly complex logistics system. My favorite part was seeing how the incentives of Amazon, as compared to UPS and FedEx, influence their flight routes.\n\n[**The Story of Uniqlo**](https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/retail/uniqlo-fast-retailing-ceo-tadashi-yanai-management-principles): The CEO of Uniqlo shares his principles for the soul of his company. Maybe I like the article because Uniqlo is one of my favorite brands, but it doubles as a window into the kind of Japanese craftsmanship I learned about in my [podcast episode with Patrick McKenzie](https://perell.com/podcast/patrick-mckenzie-internet-famous/). For years, Uniqlo was seen as an undesirable brand. But that changed with the 1998 launch of a flagship store in Tokyo’s Harajuku neighborhood, and today Uniqlo is a global brand with ~$16 billion in yearly sales.\n\n**Vitalik Buterin:** Vitalik is the founder of Ethereum and in my opinion, one of the smartest people alive today. In [this Annual Review](https://vitalik.ca/general/2020/12/28/endnotes.html), he talks about the changing role of economics in a digital world. The traditional models of economics don’t apply in the virtual world, where copying is cheap, few things are “consumable,” and goods are non-rivalrous. I also recommend his interviews with [Tyler Cowen](https://medium.com/conversations-with-tyler/vitalik-buterin-tyler-cowen-cryptocurrency-blockchain-tech-3a2b20c12c97) and [Eric Weinstein](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TwNNgiNZ7Y). If his ideas catch your attention, I also recommend the [articles on his website](https://vitalik.ca/).\n\n**[Jason Garrett speaks about Jason Witten](https://twitter.com/nfl/status/994672634066436096?s=12):** The first time I watched this video, it moved me to tears. In four minutes, Garrett highlights the beauty of football, teamwork, and leadership.\n\n**[Build a Team That Ships](https://startupboy.com/2012/04/27/build-a-team-that-ships/):** Keep the team small. All doers, not talkers. Absolutely no middle managers, People choose what to work on. No tasks longer than one week. One person per project. If they can’t ship, release them. It’s not perfect. But we ship.\n\n**[Great Founder Theory](http://samoburja.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Great-Founder-Theory-v-1.43.pdf):** Samo Burja is one of the smartest people you’ve never heard of. His ideas are as exceptional as they are unknown. He’s been researching the causes of societal decay and flourishing. Known for his Great Founder Theory, Samo says that as the landscape of founders and institutions changes, so does the landscape of society. If you’re looking for a lighter introduction, I recommend [this Medium post](https://medium.com/@samo.burja/great-founder-theory-93751e25c173) or [my interview with Samo.](http://perell.com/podcast/samo-burja)\n\n**[Ads Don’t Work that Way](http://www.meltingasphalt.com/ads-dont-work-that-way/):** This article will re-shape the way you think about advertising. It’s the best explanation I’ve seen for why brands spend millions on Super Bowl ads and why companies like Nike and Apple are so powerful. Brand advertising works because it creates common knowledge. It’s also an introduction to an under-rated concept: common knowledge. For a fact to be common knowledge among a group, it’s not enough for everyone to know it. Everyone must also know that everyone else knows it — and know that they know that they know it… and so on.\n\n**[Marshall McLuhan Interview](https://www.nextnature.net/2009/12/the-playboy-interview-marshall-mcluhan/):** [_Understanding Media_](https://amzn.to/2nR9Bz4) by Marshall McLuhan has shaped my thinking more than any other book. Writing in the 1960s, McLuhan was 50 years ahead of his time. He’s the ultimate internet philosopher. According to one writer: “McLuhan’s theories are subtle and powerful. In fact, it is hard for me to imagine anyone being able to navigate the contemporary environment without at least a good grasp of his principles.” This is the best text-based introduction to Marshall McLuhan’s ideas. I also recommend his interviews on YouTube.\n\n**[Rory Sutherland](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUeJoS3cTu8&t=11s):** Rory Sutherland is a rare intellectual whose ideas are better consumed in video than in print. Combining economics, psychology and technology, Sutherland discusses how we can improve the human experience by changing our environment. With wit and humor, Sutherland will open your eyes to the power of behavioral economics and the quirks of human decision making. If you prefer to read, I recommend [this article](https://www.edge.org/conversation/rory_sutherland-things-to-hang-on-your-mental-mug-tree).\n\n**[Understanding the Blue Church](https://medium.com/deep-code/understanding-the-blue-church-e4781b2bd9b5):** An exploration of how shifts in media are changing the kinds of narratives that flow through society. For the entire post World War II era, narratives were controlled by the mass media. Now that’s changing. Inspired by the work of Marshall McLuhan, the author proposes terms to help us navigate the 21st century media landscape. I also recommend [Paul Graham’s essay](http://paulgraham.com/re.html) on why the world is fragmenting.\n\n**[The Age of Abundance](https://redef.com/original/age-of-abundance-how-the-content-explosion-will-invert-the-media-industry):** The media business is fracturing and everybody knows it. We’re moving from a world of information scarcity to a world of information abundance. As a result, the media industry is inverting. I also recommend the following articles about the [future of marketing](https://redef.com/original/light-at-the-end-of-the-funnel-why-the-marketing-revolution-is-about-to-arrive), the [future of television](https://redef.com/original/after-tv-videos-future-will-be-bigger-more-diverse-precarious-than-its-past), the [future of live entertainment](https://redef.com/original/the-death-and-resurrection-of-live-communal-entertainment), and [the future of video](https://redef.com/original/presentation-redef-on-the-future-of-video). Collectively, these articles by Tal Shachar and Matthew Ball are the best articles I’ve seen about the future of media.\n\n**[Just Keep Buying](https://ofdollarsanddata.com/just-keep-buying-7d31402231c9%20):** Investing is like a snowball rolling down a hill. Just keep buying and watch that ball grow. When you sell out, you’re selling out future wealth. Ride the highs, weather the lows, and hold onto your assets as you acquire more. Just keep buying.\n\n**[The Freakishly Strong Base](https://www.collaborativefund.com/blog/the-freakishly-strong-base/):** Warren Buffett’s fortune isn’t due to just being a good investor, but being a good investor since he was literally a child. $80.7 billion of Warren Buffett’s $81 billion net worth was accumulated after his 50th birthday. Seventy-eight billion of the $81 billion came after he qualified for Social Security, in his mid-60s. Start investing as young as you can. Encourage young people to do the same. Build a reputation through small, consistent acts. That’s where everything huge begins. [You might also enjoy my interview with Morgan Housel, the author.](https://perell.com/podcast/morgan-housel-writing-for-the-internet/)\n\n**[Welcome to Air Space](https://www.theverge.com/2016/8/3/12325104/airbnb-aesthetic-global-minimalism-startup-gentrification):** From bars, to coffee shops, to startup offices, the internet is transforming the real-world. In this essay, [Kyle Chayka](http://perell.com/podcast/kyle-chayka) asks: “is the contemporary city like the contemporary airport — all the same?” The essay is cynical, yet thought-provoking. Chayka argues that the internet has created a soul-dissipating uniformity and a globalized sameness-as-a-service. By disconnecting from its geography and making everything as average as possible, AirSpace is the antithesis of travel.\n\n**[How Steve Kerr Leads Stephen Curry](https://twitter.com/david_perell/status/1005862520987570176):** This is leadership at its finest. In this short video, Steve Kerr, the coach of the Golden State Warriors, speaks to Stephen Curry, his star player. With each word, he dishes respect and inspires confidence. If you’re interested in Steve Kerr, he has a [fascinating backstory](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/22/sports/basketball/steve-kerr-golden-state-warriors.html).\n\n**[The Algorithmic Trap](http://perell.com/essay/the-algorithmic-trap):** Algorithms trick us into thinking we’re getting real and authentic experiences, when in fact, we’re getting the opposite. Algorithms are great at giving you something you like, but terrible at giving you something you love. Worse, by promoting familiarity, algorithms punish culture. The more I travel, the less I depend on algorithms. Especially in cities, I find myself shifting adding friction back to my travel experience — shifting away from digital recommendations and back towards human ones.\n\n**[Understanding Abundance](https://medium.com/social-capital/understanding-abundance-introduction-346dcc5280dd) and [Emergent Layers](https://medium.com/@alexdanco/emergent-layers-an-introduction-f91c3cbe0175):** These four-part series are devoted to a single question: What happens when friction goes away? As a general rule, technology makes scarce things abundant. But a new scarcity always emerges. By focusing on industry structures and competitive behavior at large, this series outlines the shift from scarcity to abundance to scarcity.\n\n**[You and Your Research](http://www.paulgraham.com/hamming.html):** This is a long speech by Richard Hamming, a Bell Labs computer pioneer. He says that knowledge and productivity are like compound interest. The more you know, the more you learn; the more you learn, the more you can do; the more you can do, the more the opportunity — it is very much like compound interest.\n\n**[How I Stay Productive](https://t.co/nrB4uAgXUr):** Nat Eliason is a good friend and one of the most productive people I know. In this article, he lays out his system for productivity with detail and diligence. I guarantee you’ll find something in here to implement.\n\n**[Growth Without Goals](http://investorfieldguide.com/growth-without-goals/):** Most productivity advice focuses on the importance of goals. Goals, though, can be constraining. This article offers an alternative. In a world where maximizing serendipity is increasingly important, rigid goals can blind us to unexpected opportunities. Rather than focusing on goals, we can build a set of daily practices and strive for continual, habitual practices instead of achievement-based success.\n\n[**PliimPRO**](https://pliim.app/): This app lets you safely share your screen. With a single click, you can hide desktop icons, pause notifications, and clean your computer. Then, after you’re done presenting, you can unclick the button and return to your computer as normal.\n\n[**Tech Subpoenaed PDFs**](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/i8i3wc8w9pukvbk/AADCTOgh-Ijy8ZbihXRRrjQsa?dl=0): Apple, Amazon, Facebook, and Google testified in front of Congress and were forced to share some fascinating presentations, emails, and chat logs. They have been deleted on official channels, but somebody graciously saved the PDFs before they were taken down. They’re a rare but fascinating look into how these firms think about competition and acquisitions.\n\n[**Building Products at Stripe**](https://newsletter.bringthedonuts.com/p/building-products-at-stripe)**:** I’ve long been fascinated by Stripe. From the moment I visited their headquarters a couple of years ago, it was immediately clear that it was a generationally special company. [This interview](https://newsletter.bringthedonuts.com/p/building-products-at-stripe) is a good window into their culture. First, they balance a sense of urgency with a long-term vision towards the future. Second, their writing-heavy culture enables rigorous thinking and extreme attention to detail.\n\n[**WhisperSync**](https://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html?ie=UTF8&docId=1000827761)**:** The entire book industry is limited by Amazon’s monopoly over book sales and electronic reading devices, but WhisperSync is a rare bright spot. For certain books, you can read and listen to a book at the same time if you purchase both the Kindle version and the audiobook. Doing so is the best way to highlight and take notes of audiobooks too.\n\n[**The Deployment Age**](http://reactionwheel.net/2015/10/the-deployment-age.html)**:** Jerry Neumann wrote an excellent introduction to Carlota Perez’ framework of *The Deployment Age,* from her book [_Technological Revolutions and Financial Capital_](https://amzn.to/2NemtJk)*.* The book comes highly recommended by people like Alex Danco, Fred Wilson, and Marc Andreessen. Based on the theory, we’re moving into an age of “production capital,” which [Neumann explains well](http://reactionwheel.net/2015/10/the-deployment-age.html).\n\n**Entrepreneurship Hacks:** I found two great resources while hosting my Annual Review: [_Bench Bookkeeping_](https://bench.co/) and [_You Need A Budget_](https://app.youneedabudget.com/1f8314f3-b3e3-4fea-9d9b-55dca6661cfb/budget). The book-keeping service is geared towards small businesses and sole proprietors. The second is for anybody. *YNAB* has a book, a podcast, and a highly recommended software product. Oh, and here are my friend Tiago’s notes from the [book](https://www.evernote.com/l/AMyBwvqZ1plDBY7cVP1WcnLmXFjHF3ngA2I).\n\n[**Sequoia’s YouTube Thesis**](https://gallery.mailchimp.com/ae06bb4227110efa2a369753b/files/4024fb58-74ce-4616-90eb-99621b9067f6/Roelof_Botha_Sequoia_Youtube.pdf)**:** Sequoia Capital is widely regarded as the best venture capital firm in Silicon Valley. They were early investors in Apple, Google, Oracle, PayPal, Stripe, YouTube, Instagram, Yahoo! and WhatsApp. This memo from 2005 shows how they think about an investment. If you’re still curious and want to learn about the firm, I recommend this [podcast about Sequioa’s history](https://www.acquired.fm/episodes/sequoia-capital-part-1).\n\n[**Power to the People**](https://kwokchain.com/2019/04/09/making-uncommon-knowledge-common/)**:** Rich Barton is a rare breed. He’s built three billion-dollar consumer technology companies — Expedia, Zillow, and Glassdoor. This post tells the story of Barton’s strategy for building all three companies, which look different at first glance but are the same under the hood. If you’re interested in Internet business models, this essay is for you.\n\n[**A History of Stripe**](https://www.cbinsights.com/research/report/stripe-teardown/): My friend Conor Witt (my co-writer for [_Naked Brands: The Future of Finance_](https://perell.com/essay/the-future-of-finance)) joined CB Insights, and kicked things off with a mega deep dive into Stripe’s relationship to the global payments system and their plans for the future.\n\n[**Rethinking Economics**](https://amzn.to/2wZA8il)**:** I’m torn about the value of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) as a metric. On one hand, it’s highly correlated with happiness indices, and people like [Tyler Cowen](https://www.cato-unbound.org/2019/01/09/tyler-cowen/case-longer-term) have gracefully argued that we should pursue a strategy of maximizing sustainable GDP, with a low discount rate on the future. With that said, the headstrong pursuit of GDP has perverse side effects for physical and emotional health. In the past 100 years, in America, we’ve seen the [decline of community](https://www.beyondintractability.org/bksum/putnam-bowling), the [death of the nuclear family](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2020/03/the-nuclear-family-was-a-mistake/605536/), and a country that is increasingly obese and diabetic.\n\n[**Great Assistant**](https://greatassistant.com/)**:** I hired my first personal assistant using this company. It’s pricey, but worth it in my opinion. For $4,000, they help you with all the logistics of hiring and training an assistant. If you choose to work with Great Assistant, tell them I sent you. On another note, If you ever need to delegate a project, [I recommend their 360 Delegation process](https://www.profitfactory.com/360delegation/), [which I summarized here](https://twitter.com/david_perell/status/1245536487476617218?s=20).\n\n[**Crisis in Higher Education**](https://amzn.to/2zZ9yac): An obscure book about the future of higher education, focused on how small liberal arts schools can save themselves. The short answer: increase enrollment. It’s written by Jeff Docking, the President of [Adrian College.](http://adrian.edu/) I had breakfast with him and he’s exceptionally sharp. In 2005, the school had 840 enrolled students and had a tuition income of $8.54 million. By fall of 2011, enrollment had soared to 1,688, and tuition income had increased to $20.45 million.\n\n[**Basecamp’s Legal Policies**](https://github.com/basecamp/policies)**:** An open-source GitHub repository with Basecamp’s policies, legal contracts, and terms of service. If you run an online business, starting here instead of with a lawyer could save you thousands of dollars. They are free to use under the Creative Commons Attribution license, so you can copy them and put them to work.\n\n[**The Ladders of Wealth Creation**](https://nathanbarry.com/wealth-creation/)**:** This essay from Nathan Barry lays out the roadmap for transitioning from an employee to running your own business, similar to the one I walked before starting my business.\n\n[**The Startup School Library**](https://www.startupschool.org/library)**:** If you’re interested in building startups, this page is for you. It’s a collection of the best things Y-Combinator has learned about growing companies, from recruiting, to marketing, to fundraising.\n\n[**Manias and Mimesis**](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3469465)**:** An outstanding paper that applies Rene Girard’s Mimetic Theory to Financial Bubbles. It looks at a series of case studies, from the 1840s railway mania to the ICO boom and collapse, and even to present-day mimesis-driven market distortions. If you want a shorter analysis of a similar theme, I [recommend this essay](https://medium.com/newco/innovative-exuberance-ad75ee39f4c5) on bubbles as innovation accelerators.\n\n[**Saudi Aramco**](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2019-04-01/saudi-aramco-makes-a-lot-of-money)**:** An introduction to one of the world’s wealthiest oil companies, which earned $366 billion in revenue in 2018, with a net income of roughly $110 billion. Most people don’t know this, but it was a wholly US-owned company until 1974 when Saudi Arabia got a 25% stake in the company (today, The Kingdom owns the entire company). This line says it all: “[Saudi Aramco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Aramco) is—more even than Apple or Alphabet or Facebook Inc. or all the traditional champions—the greatest machine for the generation of money that the world has ever seen.”\n\n[**Working in Public**](https://amzn.to/30C4CD1)**:** I read this new book about the economics of open-source software and online creators, in part because I interviewed the author, [Nadia Eghbal.](https://perell.com/podcast/nadia-eghbal-open-source-software) She worked at GitHub for roughly five years, where she interviewed hundreds of open-source developers. For a lighter introduction to her writing, I recommend [_Being Basic as a Virtue_](https://nadiaeghbal.com/basic)and [_The Tyranny of Ideas._](https://nadiaeghbal.com/ideas)\n\n[**CleanShot**](https://getcleanshot.com/): This app solves a simple, but important problem: taking screenshots on a Mac. If that’s something you do a lot, check out CleanShot. It solves a simple problem very, very well.\n\n[**CommandE**](https://getcommande.com/)**:** A cloud search tool for your computer so you can open any document, from Google Docs, to Dropbox, to Evernote, to Slack, to Asana, with a single search.\n\n[**Bar Talk and Innovation**](https://www.ssrn.com/abstract=3489466)**:** This paper measures the importance of informal social interaction for innovation. It does so by measuring the decline in innovation when wet counties turned dry during the Prohibition and banned alcohol consumption. It turns out, the negative effects of banning alcohol on innovation lasted only three years, after which groups found new ways to socialize and generate new ideas.\n\n[**An Introduction to Thomas Sowell**](https://www.city-journal.org/thomas-sowell-race-poverty-culture)**:** An excellent introduction of Sowell’s work by Coleman Hughes. If you don’t know Sowell, he’s a Senior Fellow at Stanford University’s Hoover Institution. This essay tells the story of his life, from growing up without electricity or hot water in North Carolina, to moving to Harlem in 1939, to receiving his Ph.D. in economics at the University of Chicago.\n\n[**Loom**](https://www.loom.com/)**:** This is one of my favorite software tools. I use it for screen and video recordings whenever I need to explain something to a coworker. Suppose I have feedback for my assistant. Instead of writing up my thoughts, I record a video to show my thinking, which saves time and improves our communication because I can point to specific things on my screen.\n\n**Palantir:** One of the most interesting companies in America. Palantir specializes in giant data analysis projects, mostly for governments and multinational companies. For balanced introductions to the company, I recommend [this explainer from Kevin Simler](https://www.quora.com/What-specifically-does-Palantir-do) about the product and [this one from Byrne Hobart](https://diff.substack.com/p/palantir-on-business-cults-and-politics) about the business model.\n\n[**Starbucks’ Monetary Superpower**](http://jpkoning.blogspot.com/2019/08/starbucks-monetary-superpower.html)**:** I use the Starbucks app all the time because it’s one of the best payment apps in the world. This article explains how investing in it has turned the company into a quasi-bank. They have ~$1.6 billion in stored value card liabilities outstanding (6% of the company’s liabilities), which come from physical gift cards and the total digital value of balances in the Starbucks mobile app. All that money doubles as free debt that customers loan to the company.\n\n[**What is Snapchat?**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykGXIQAHLnA)**:** An old video from Snap CEO Evan Spiegel, where he explains how images are changing conversation. “Snapchat has to do with how the photographs have changed. Today, pictures are being used for talking. That’s why people are taking and sending so many pictures on Snapchat every day.”\n\n[**Hiring for the British Parliament**](https://dominiccummings.com/2020/01/02/two-hands-are-a-lot-were-hiring-data-scientists-project-managers-policy-experts-assorted-weirdos/)**:** Here’s a job description from Dominic Cummings, the brilliant architect behind Britain’s *Vote Leave* campaign. He’s bringing a fresh approach to politics by changing how political decisions are made and welcoming the dissent required to make radical changes to government. Cummings isn’t looking for the kinds of well-spoken and well-networked people you usually find in government. No. He’s looking for weirdos, scientists, and mathematicians. My friend called this post “the most promising thing I’ve seen out of Western government in a decade.” And he might be right. If you’re looking for an introduction to Dominic Cummings, I [recommend this 30-minute talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDbRxH9Kiy4).\n\n[**Burger King’s Advertising Genius**](https://twitter.com/GoodMarketingHQ/status/1308398851192164354?s=20)**:** Marketing at its finest. I won’t give away the 90-second video, but Burger King used a clever marketing trick to attract millions of dollars in free attention and associate the brand with the world’s best soccer players.\n\n**[The Death of Sears:](https://www.versobooks.com/blogs/4385-failing-to-plan-how-ayn-rand-destroyed-sears)** A story about the fall of Sears, formerly one of America’s top retail brands. The company decided to implement an internal market where departments, stores, trucks, and suppliers competed against each other for cash and attention. But the market-based strategy was a total failure. My favorite anecdote was how Sears’ famous appliance brand, Kenmore, was divided between the appliance division and the branding one. Since non-Sears branded appliances were more profitable to the appliances division, they began to offer better placement to Kenmore’s rivals, which undermined overall profitability. Yikes. Thanks to the excellent [Sid Jha](https://twitter.com/sidharthajha) for the recommendation.\n\n[**What is Amazon?:**](https://zackkanter.com/2019/03/13/what-is-amazon/)This is everything an essay should be and more. The author, Zack Kanter, is the founder of Stedi and understands how Amazon works better than anybody I’ve ever met. This essay is a long-form explanation of his analysis. My favorite part is his thesis that Amazon is a perpetual motion machine that innovates by discovering what works and amplifying the highest leverage experiments — evolution in real life.\n\n[**Alex Karp Interview**](https://www.axelspringer.com/en/press-releases/mathias-dopfner-interviews-alex-karp-in-the-axel-springer-inside-pod-no-one-wants-to-live-in-a-world-where-they-have-no-private-sphere)**:** A two-part conversation with the CEO of Palantir, who is a fascinating guy. He runs a controversial company, and he addresses many of the critiques in [this interview](https://www.axelspringer.com/en/press-releases/mathias-dopfner-interviews-alex-karp-in-the-axel-springer-inside-pod-no-one-wants-to-live-in-a-world-where-they-have-no-private-sphere) with admirable levels of intellectual rigor. Just as interesting, he has a PhD in what amounts to progressive philosophy from the Frankfurt School in Germany. For more about Karp’s background, here’s an [excellent long-form essay about his academic career](https://www.boundary2.org/2020/07/moira-weigel-palantir-goes-to-the-frankfurt-school/).\n\n**Long Haul by Simple Flying:** I’m an aviation geek, so I can’t believe I just found this YouTube channel, which eloquently describes trends in commercial aviation. In particular, I enjoyed this [history of the Boeing 737](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3_SoIkBras) ([which I wrote about here](https://perell.com/essay/boeing-737-max)) and this one about the [rise & fall of the Airbus A340](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cabTEFVOo88&t=474s).\n\n**​**[**Airlines and Frequent Flier Points**](https://marker.medium.com/why-the-survival-of-the-airlines-depends-on-frequent-flyer-programs-2509bd3f25d0)**:** Airlines look like they make money from flights, but they actually make money from loyalty programs. Without its loyalty program, Delta would be worth -$7 billion. With it, it’s a $19 billion company. This quote stuck out: “The mechanics of a loyalty program are simple: Flyers earn rewards, generally by flying or using branded credit cards. They redeem those rewards for flights.” If you prefer video, you’ll like this explainer from [Wendover Productions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggUduBmvQ_4).\n\n[**Nick Yoder’s Prediction Algorithm**](https://nickyoder.com/wall-street-university-betting-markets/)**:** There’s a narrative out there that the polling data for the US election 2020 was terribly wrong. Here’s a data point against it: my friend used it to place hundreds of bets on the presidential election and walked out on top by a wide margin. If you’d like to learn about his methods, you’ll enjoy this multi-part series, which will also teach you about statistical modeling, trading, and portfolio management.\n\n**20th Century Technology Theorists:** The gift that keeps on giving. Marshall McLuhan’s [_Understanding Media_](https://amzn.to/332O87S) is probably the most influential book I’ve read to date. Looking through the footnotes has led me to other philosophers of technologies Lewis Mumford, who wrote [_Technics and Civilization_](https://amzn.to/2UM3JnK) and Water Ong’s *Orality and Literacy* ([here’s my book review](https://perell.com/essay/orality-and-literacy))*.* Their work gives you a framework to evaluate all kinds of new technologies, and reveals how the Internet is changing society.\n\n---\n\n## Creativity & Learning\n\n**​**[**How to Take Smart Notes**](https://amzn.to/3tEgGQ0)**:** You know me: I love things that demystify the creative process. If you want to improve your writing, build a note-taking system. This is the best book I’ve seen about how to do that.” The author explains the creative strategies of a prolific sociologist named Niklas Luhmann. For a synopsis, I recommend [Tiago Forte’s written summary](https://fortelabs.co/blog/how-to-take-smart-notes/) and [his interview with the author](https://youtu.be/kXnR7qX3BDc). In typical Tiago fashion, he nailed the pitch for reading this book: “Instead of squeezing as many pages as possible out of one idea, How To Take Smart Notes squeezes as many ideas as possible onto every page.”\n\n**​**[**Mr. Beast’s Story**](https://youtu.be/3A8kawxMOcQ)**:** This is the story of one of the most popular YouTubers in the world. Mr. Beast struggled in school and couldn’t stand sitting in class and listening to boring lectures. To his mother’s chagrin, he became obsessed with YouTube during his teenage years, and along with a group of friends, obsessed over the mechanics of viral YouTube videos — from choosing topics, to editing, to thumbnails, to video coloring to the pacing of videos. Today, he has more than 100 million subscribers across all his channels.\n\n**​**[**Richard Feynman, on Textbooks**](https://www.rangevoting.org/FeynTexts.html)**:** The Nobel Prize-winning physicist once served on the state of California’s curriculum commission. He was tasked with determining which math and physics textbooks should enter public schools. He insists that he was among the few committee members who actually read the textbooks. The rest, he says, “judged the books by their covers.” He points to one textbook which received high marks even though it consisted entirely of blank pages. Even when the textbooks had information, they were characteristically lousy, false, hurried, ambiguous, and useless. Feynman writes: “I was the only guy on that commission who read all the books and didn’t get any information from the book publishers except what was in the books themselves, the things that would ultimately go to the schools.” Yikes.\n\n**​**[**Jordan Peterson, on Music**](https://twitter.com/david_perell/status/1490070139949264901?s=20&t=ApikIy2VjkTjxLxcHQHRQw)**:** One of the most beautiful descriptions of music I’ve ever heard. Peterson argues that music is multiple patterns layered on top of each other, just like the structure of reality — which is made of patterns as much as objects. Thus, music is an analog of the structure of existence itself. Music also represents life by putting you on the border of chaos and order because good music is predictable enough to be coherent but unpredictable enough to surprise you.\n\n[**Cercle Music Sets**](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPKT_csvP72boVX0XrMtagQ)**:** Let’s talk about beautiful music. If you’re looking for deep house sets to listen to while you work, the Cercle DJ sets are fantastic. All of them are produced in beautiful places, from a stage on the Argentinian salt flats to a hot air balloon in Turkey’s Cappadocia region. Start with this one from [Ben B](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvRhUHTV_8k)​[ö](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvRhUHTV_8k)​[hmer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvRhUHTV_8k) or this one from [Above & Beyond](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MEzU1HvBo6Y). Given the production values, make sure you peek at the screen every few minutes as you go about your work.\n\n**​**[**Beethoven’s Genius**](https://twitter.com/writtenbyirene/status/1468645931214123010?s=20)**:** Piano meets Guitar Hero. Instead of looking at a bunch of tapping fingers, this video illustrates the wondrous complexity of how to master the piano. Watching it, you can see my [_Practice Analytically, Perform Intuitively_](https://perell.com/essay/practice-analytically-perform-intuitively/) theory in action. There’s so much happening that the rational mind can’t possibly be in charge. With enough expertise, the intuitive self can take the wheel and perform something beautiful.\n\n**​**[**Kanye West’s Career**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8K9iEMyYDo)**:** Watching this, I couldn’t believe how many stages Kanye’s been through. His discography has morphed from the audacity of *Through the Wire,* to the electronic sounds of *808s and Heartbreak*, to Christianity-inspired albums like *Jesus is King*. Away from the music, he’s spoken his mind and generated tons of controversy. This video essay explores how his music and personality have evolved and made him one of the most influential artists alive today.\n\n**The Great Courses Lecture Series:** Audiobooks are boring because books are made to be read, not listened to. Thus, only the narrators who also wrote the book have the liberty to adjust the content in order to make it memorable and enjoyable. As a substitute, I recommend the Great Courses lecture series from Audible. Though I wish the lectures had better notes or transcripts, they’re almost all high-quality. I’ve enjoyed [this series on Plato’s philosophy in *The Republic*](https://amzn.to/3GXVBqp) and this one on [St. Augustine’s *City of God*](https://amzn.to/3mdmC12)_._\n\n**Jacob Collier:** To be honest, I don’t even know if I like Collier’s music. But man, I could listen to him talk about music all day. I discovered him through an [interview he recorded with Porter Robinson](https://youtu.be/hm4eqY9XX18) about the mechanics of music theory. You might also like this [masterclass on harmony and rhythm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_nARBto3Tg).\n\n​[**Rick Rubin Documentary**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vabwGiTWRVo)**:** Meet the man behind artists like Kanye West, Jay-Z, Mac Miller, Johnny Cash, Weezer, and the Beastie Boys. I’m not just impressed by the names. I’m impressed by the diversity of genres. Rubin started as a formal music producer and the co-founder of Def Jam, but he’s grown into a creative psychologist who provides a space where artists can be vulnerable and emotionally naked. He’s intuitive instead of technical, and in the studio, he aims for invisibility. Instead of putting his stamp on the music, he tries to recede into the background. The more excess he can remove, the better. As Kanye once said: “Rick’s not a producer. He’s a reducer.”\n\n**​**[**Compulsory Schooling:**](https://www.bretthall.org/part-2-epistemology-and-compulsory-school.html) The most popular TED Talk of all time is [_Do Schools Kill Creativity?_](https://www.ted.com/talks/sir_ken_robinson_do_schools_kill_creativity) But here, Brett Hall argues that the talk’s core thesis doesn’t go far enough. The problem with education isn’t the Common Core curriculum or the fact that we teach to the test. It’s compulsory schooling. Hall’s pedagogy is simple: Let students learn what they want. Then, get them to guess what’s correct and test it. And remember, [learning begins with inspiration.](https://perell.com/essay/how-learning-happens/)\n\n**​**[**Deconstructing Kanye West’s Voice**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgJyhKEZ8QU)**:** Kanye recorded his first single, *Through the Wire,* after a car accident with his jaw completely wired. On the track, his voice is muffled and his words are hard to make sense of. On the track, he says: “Yo, Gee, they can’t stop me from rappin’, can they?” This video deconstructs how Kanye used autotune to alter his voice early in his career on albums like [_808s and Heartbreak_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/808s_%26_Heartbreak)*.* And on [_Graduation_](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graduation_(album)>)*, he* even used synthesizers that sound like the human voice.\n\n**Venkatesh Rao’s Book Reviews:** His writing on [_Ribbonfarm_](https://www.ribbonfarm.com/about/) was like a North Star for me when I started writing online. It attracted all kinds of up-and-coming writers, many of whom I contacted directly and later became friends with. [Tiago Forte](https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2017/01/31/the-throughput-of-learning/) even became my business partner. I recommend Venkatesh Rao’s book reviews on [_Seeing like a State_](https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2010/07/26/a-big-little-idea-called-legibility/) and [_A Brief History of the Corporation: 1600 to 2100_](https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2011/06/08/a-brief-history-of-the-corporation-1600-to-2100/)_._\n\n**​**[**Why Read the Odyssey?**](https://octavian.substack.com/p/daniel-mendelsohn-on-the-odyssey)**:** In [_Saving the Liberal Arts_](https://perell.com/essay/saving-the-liberal-arts/), I argued that college students are too young to study the Liberal Arts. Even Plato said that people aren’t prepared to study the Liberal Arts until the age of 30. In Book VII of The Republic, he writes: “Let us take every possible care that young persons do not study philosophy too early.” [In this interview](https://octavian.substack.com/p/daniel-mendelsohn-on-the-odyssey), Daniel Mendelsohn explains why ancient stories like *The Odyssey* still have practical benefit. He says: “When your father dies, your accounting degree is not going to help you at all to process that experience. Homer will help you.” I also resonated with this comment: “The crude preoccupation with moneymaking as the only goal of a college education is giving us a citizenry that is extremely degraded, as far as I’m concerned. I think it’s only the crudest and least interesting practicality that has no time for the humanities.”\n\n**​**[**Madonna Who Shows the Beauty in Going Overboard:**](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/08/13/arts/design/parmigianino-madonna-of-the-long-neck.html) I don’t remember the last time I enjoyed something so much from the New York Times. I continue to be frustrated by the quality of art education. Even the world’s top museums don’t always do a good job of providing context about their paintings. For inspiration, they should look at this series. If you like impressionist art, [you’ll like this one](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/06/04/arts/design/berthe-morisot-in-england.html?action=click&module=card&pageType=theWeekenderLink). If you prefer a classical vibe, [start here](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/08/13/arts/design/parmigianino-madonna-of-the-long-neck.html). This too reveals how software can make learning more enjoyable than books.\n\n**​**[**Gatto’s Seven Lessons**](https://www.unschooling.com/t/the-seven-lesson-schoolteacher/266)**:** John Gatto spent 30 years as a New York City school teacher. In this critique, he argues that the modern education system is *designed* to produce confused, passive, dependent, and materialistic children. The most surprising idea is about literacy rates. Gatto points to a paper released by Senator Ted Kennedy’s office that the literacy rate was 98% before the advent of compulsory education. By 1990, that figure had dropped to 91%. Though the argument doesn’t quite pass the sniff test, I’ve [long doubted the validity](https://twitter.com/david_perell/status/1293392496047792128?s=20) of literacy rate measurements. No matter what, Gatto’s speech is worth reading in full.\n\n**John O’Donahue:** My all-time favorite poet, and I discovered him via [this magnificent interview with Krista Tippett](https://onbeing.org/programs/john-odonohue-the-inner-landscape-of-beauty-aug2017/) after he passed away. O’Donahue’s at his best when he talks about nature, friendship, and conversation. In the synthesis of all three, our souls come alive. Beyond the podcast interview, I recommend his books [_Anam Cara_](https://amzn.to/3nLOaMq) and [_Walking in Wonder_](https://amzn.to/2XkurZ7)_._\n\n**​**[**The One World Schoolhouse**](https://amzn.to/2XIUM3d)**:** Sal Khan is the founder of [_Khan Academy_](https://www.youtube.com/user/khanacademy)*,* and his book offers a lovely vision for the future of education. More than anything, he changed my mind about the value of testing. The problem with school is that tests feel like a form of insane judgment, which make students nervous and insecure. Tests should be matter-of-fact instead. With software, tests will motivate students, automatically generate a curriculum for them to follow, and show them where to direct their learning. For a scaled-down version of the book, [I recommend this 10-minute talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MTRxRO5SRA) by the author.\n\n**Andy Matuschak, on Education:** Speaking of Khan Academy, my friend Andy used to lead the Research & Development team. He published three extended essays during his time there. [My favorite one is about reasoning skills](https://early.khanacademy.org/open-ended/), and specifically, the challenges of scaling feedback with open-ended projects. It’s pretty technical though, so I only recommend it for people who are deeply interested in pedagogy. For something simpler, you may enjoy [my podcast with Andy](https://perell.com/podcast/andy-matuschak/) and what I consider to be his best essay: [_Why Books Don’t Work_](https://andymatuschak.org/books/)_._\n\n**​**[**Federer as Religious Experience**](https://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/20/sports/playmagazine/20federer.html)**:** Most writers describe the world with the clarity of a flip-phone camera, but reading David Foster Wallace is like looking at a 16-megapixel photo. This essay is my favorite example. Wallace describes Federer’s tennis game with a level of technicolor detail that almost makes it difficult to read. It’s actually hard for my mind to process such vivid descriptions because they’re so beyond what I’m normally capable of. Whether you’re a tennis fan or not, you’ll enjoy this essay if you appreciate good writing.\n\n**​**[**Why Books Don’t Work**](https://andymatuschak.org/books)**:** Why do we remember so little from the books we read? Books carry certain assumptions about the way we learn. Like a lecture, they assume that if you just give a student enough information, they’ll learn something. But information is like food. You can’t just consume it. You have to digest it. When it comes to knowledge, that digestion happens in activities such as writing, Socratic dialogue, and working on difficult projects. Without active implementation, the vast majority of what we read will never be stored in our long-term memory. [In this essay](https://andymatuschak.org/books) and [this podcast](https://www.econtalk.org/andy-matuschak-on-books-and-learning/), the author Andy Matuschak explores the problem and presents a solution rooted in spaced repetition.\n\n**​**[**Da Vinci**](https://amzn.to/3eYbku1)**:** [Tiago Forte](https://perell.com/podcast/tiago-forte-whats-next-in-education/) turned me onto Leonardo Da Vinci’s biography because he was an obsessive note-taker and prolific creative. His lack of an education stands out. He was mainly self-taught and learned mostly through experience and experiments. His story reminds me of the impressive homeschoolers I’ve met who think outside the box because they don’t even know the box exists. As a society, we care too much about education and too little about learning.\n\n**​**[**Quentin Tarantino’s Writing Process**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jL48njx7MJg)**:** In writing, there’s a precious liminal state that comes between the time you stop writing and start transitioning into the normal world. It’s like waking up. Though you’re technically awake in the first 30 minutes after your eyes open, you aren’t fully aware of what’s going on. That’s why Tarantino gives himself time to wander during his workday. Here’s a short video about his [“write, wander, plan” methodology](https://twitter.com/david_perell/status/1420424566535462917?s=20) and a longer one about how he wrote [Inglourious Basterds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08t5lLDzIN8).\n\n**​**[**Becoming a Magician**](https://autotranslucence.wordpress.com/2018/03/30/becoming-a-magician/)**:** Here’s a fun heuristic for personal growth: find the magicians. You’ll know that you’ve found one when their results are attractive, but their methods confuse you. Embody their perspective deeply enough and they’ll give you new ways of seeing. From the outset, it’s hard to explain how because, by definition, their methods look like voodoo to you. Ultimately, finding magicians is one of my favorite meta-principles for learning.\n\n**​**[**Interview with Frederick Wiseman**](https://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/7210/the-art-of-documentary-no-1-frederick-wiseman)**:** I had never heard of Wiseman before reading this interview, but it’s the best thing I’ve read about the creative process in a long time. I always say that writing is like making a statue. First, you need a giant ball of marble. Then you need to shape it. Wiseman follows a similar process of collecting tons of material, looking through it all, and waiting until the end to determine the final structure. Since the interview might be paywalled for you, [here’s a page](https://www.evernote.com/l/AUdUyYxBedFO1Lmy3z2HU6nbsYiiLDBzuBw) with my favorite segments.\n\n**​**[**Letter to a Young Songwriter**](http://visakanv.com/1000/0152-letter-to-a-young-songwriter/)**:** This piece is written for musicians, but it applies to writers too. When you’re new to a creative medium, you want to be prolific. Only after you’ve published many pieces do you know what makes a song great and what you need to do your best creative work. Creation also changes how you consume. All of a sudden, you don’t just absorb the content. You absorb the structure, the rhetorical tricks, and all the ways creators make their work captivating. It’s like X-ray vision. Knowledge of your craft transcends the intellect and enters the body. Eventually, you realize things about the creative medium you couldn’t have possibly anticipated when you were starting out.\n\n**Eminem’s Creative Process:** The more I study the greats, the more I realize that top-tier production begins with attentive consumption. [This](https://youtu.be/gnQk8UgXpWU) [video](https://youtu.be/gnQk8UgXpWU) of Eminem is the best example I’ve seen. Watch the way he obsesses over details and describes his craft. Then [watch this interview on 60 Minutes](https://youtu.be/pPXBwy3JgVo), where he talks about rhyming and note-taking. Excellence is a beautiful thing.\n\n**​**[**The 11 Laws of Showrunning**](http://okbjgm.weebly.com/uploads/3/1/5/0/31506003/11_laws_of_showrunning_nice_version.pdf)**:** This is the best thing I’ve ever read about managing creatives. It’s an obscure PDF, written in the 70s. It’s written for people in Hollywood but applies to anybody who does unbounded work. My favorite point is how sentences like “I’ll know it when I see it” are a cardinal sin. As a manager, you need to set a clear vision. Preach it day in and day out until it becomes gospel. But you want to do it in a way that ignites the creative spirit in people who work for you. For example, the design brief for the original Coca-Cola bottle in 1915 said: “A bottle so distinct that it could be recognized by touch in the dark or when lying broken on the ground.”\n\n**​**[**J. Cole**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlpN3S16ZAs&feature=youtu.be)**:** I took a Hip-Hop appreciation class during my freshman year of high school. I still remember one of the seniors doing a non-stop freestyle for upwards of 90 minutes. It was amazing. How did he come up with ideas so fast? [This video of J. Cole](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlpN3S16ZAs&feature=youtu.be) gave me the same sensation. He exudes a special magic in the room — the kind you only find when you combine natural talent and cultivated excellence.\n\n**​**[**Krista Tippett**](https://onbeing.org/series/podcast/)**:** Some people make the world a better place just by being exactly who they are. Krista Tippett is one such person. Her podcast, *On Being,* is like a touchstone to me. It pairs the presence of meditation with the awakening of scripture. My all-time favorite interview is [the one with John O’Donahue](https://onbeing.org/programs/john-odonohue-the-inner-landscape-of-beauty-aug2017/). It inspired my essay: [_The Fruits of Friendship_](https://perell.com/essay/fruits-of-friendship/)_._\n\n**​**[**Arnold Schwarzenegger**](https://amzn.to/3jDrvQw)**:** Well, this was fun! I’ve regained the excitement I used to have around weightlifting after I found a kick-ass gym in Oaxaca. People drip with sweat as they move through the gym, and the walls are covered with photos of professional bodybuilders. It’s awesome, partially because gyms in America are afraid to be so intense. [After seeing this snippet on Twitter](https://twitter.com/GraduatedBen/status/1403898752054837249?s=20), I picked up Arnold’s book about bodybuilding. It begins with his story of winning five Mr. Universe and seven Mr. Olympia and Mr. World titles. In the second half of the book, he shares practical lessons for diet and a weightlifting routine. [I devoured the entire book](https://amzn.to/3jDrvQw).\n\n**How Tracy Austin Broke My Heart:** Sometimes, great performers have such a natural talent that they’re unable to describe what makes them so great. This essay by David Foster Wallace explores that phenomenon through the lens of tennis. Though it focuses on sports, it’s not an essay about sports at all. I recommend [listening to the essay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7BYK0hZibk) because Wallace is somehow so good at reading his own writing. Or, [here’s the PDF](https://sites.psu.edu/kingsel/files/2016/08/DFW-How-Tracy-Austin-Broke-My-Heart-1994-1lctx91.pdf) if you prefer to read it.\n\n​[**Pixar’s Guide to Storytelling**](https://twitter.com/david_perell/status/1402416871408914440?s=20)**:** Short, simple, and fun. A few years ago, a Pixar employee wrote down what she’s learned about effective storytelling. I have two favorites. First, “You won’t see what the story is actually about til you’re at the end of it. Now rewrite.” And second, “Putting it on paper lets you start fixing it. If it stays in your head, a perfect idea, you’ll never share it with anyone.“ If you want to fall down the Pixar rabbit hole, I recommend [_Creativity Inc._](https://amzn.to/3zuxoot)by the co-founder of Pixar.\n\n**​**[**How Art Arrived at Jackson Pollock**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1irNBh2qg8)**:** I’m obsessed with Nerdwriter’s channel. Most of his videos are about painting, movies, and poetry. His videos move at a slower pace than what you’ll otherwise find on YouTube, but that’s because his ideas are so deep that you need time to process them. If you’re in the rabbit hole mood, I [recommend his “Understanding Art” series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLJAXu5OD-c&list=PLwg4AG1KkgLwP5FuUIiVEy-ILMD23AN1v).\n\n**Neil Gaiman:** I spent the week listening to interviews from one of the most successful fiction writers of our time, who’s written comics like *The Sandman* and novels like *Stardust* and *American Gods.* To begin, I [recommend this interview](https://tim.blog/2019/03/28/neil-gaiman/) and [this YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPN7vDu9Rsk). Next up for me is [his Masterclass](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qg0_FinB6EE).\n\n**MKBHD:** If you’re a creator and feeling down about the quality of your work, remember this clip from MKBHD — who is one of the biggest tech YouTubers in the world. Today, his [channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/mkbhd/featured) has more than 15 million subscribers and his videos have been viewed ~3 billion times. But his 100th YouTube video [looked like this](https://twitter.com/david_perell/status/1504892259023609858?s=20&t=Icdv0UZbu3J7kqQVy5uCQw).\n\n​[**The Inner Game of Tennis**](https://amzn.to/3ef7qMa)**:** File this in the category of books that seem like they have to do with one thing but actually have to do with something else. On the surface, this book seems like it’s about tennis. But it’s actually about the relationship between body and mind, as they relate to performance. The author Tim Gallwey observed that most tennis players are plagued by too much judgment and technical instruction. Instead, he suggests that people learn through intuitive awareness and trust the ancient wisdom of their motor skills. [This YouTube video provides a good overview](https://youtu.be/HzR8x5MgvDw). Now, I’m reading another one of his books: [The Inner Game of Golf](https://amzn.to/2QyYUz3).\n\n**​**[**Behind the Curtain**](https://youtube.com/c/BehindtheCurtain)**:** A series of video essays about the most successful screenwriters in Hollywood. The videos are curated interviews with big shots like [Quentin Tarantino](https://youtu.be/08t5lLDzIN8), writers of popular shows like [Rick and Morty](https://youtu.be/AktlCvZzkzk), and tactical ideas like “[How Pro Screenwriters Beat Writer’s Block](https://youtu.be/DplTEL4IoxA).” Instead of inserting their editorial voice, the editors scavenge the Internet for clips and let their subjects speak for themselves.\n\n**​**[**Parasite**](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasite_(2019_film)>)**:** I finally watched Parasite. It was as good as everybody said it would be. Beyond the movie, I enjoyed [this 15-minute string of interviews with Bong Joon Ho](https://youtu.be/Rv_DzVn6CcM) about how he wrote the movie, and [this YouTube video from Nerdwriter](https://youtu.be/ma1rD2OP85c) about the movie was filmed.\n\n**​**[**The Note that Defines Pop Music**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR32h5jhPtU)**:** YouTube is the best thing that’s ever happened to music education. It’s instant, fun, and visual in a way it’s never been before. [This video is a good example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tR32h5jhPtU). One strategy in particular has taken over the pop world. Listen to enough pop music and you’ll start hearing the same note over and over again. It’s called “The Supertonic,” otherwise known as the second note in the scale. While we’re at it, I also recommend [this sample deconstruction](https://twitter.com/NehhLmao/status/1363925150958317568) from Daft Punk’s “One More Time.”\n\n​[**The Most Unruly**](https://youtube.com/c/NoisyImagesOfficial)**:** I appreciate how much Internet culture focuses as much on the behind-the-scenes of a craft as the craft itself. This YouTube channel, which focuses on Hip-Hop, is a stand-out example. In addition to mini-biographies of rappers like [Jay-Z](https://youtu.be/qu9e7YhYrac) and [Eminem](https://youtu.be/ufg64THzrfE), you’ll find making-of videos for [The Life of Pablo](https://youtu.be/EELBDtM3FGs) and [808s and Heartbreak](https://youtu.be/xSmgnf6PHmE) (my favorite Kanye album).\n\n**​**[**A Steve Jobs Tribute**](https://youtu.be/n1HYdsbgYMA)**:** This one moved me to tears. Casey Neistat made this video after the iPhone’s original release in 2007 but didn’t release it until Jobs’ death. It’s filmed in the first person vlog-style that Casey made so popular on YouTube almost a decade after the video was published. If you’re an Apple fanatic, this will pull on all your heartstrings.\n\n**​**[**Tiger Woods and Collin Morikawa**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zXrDVRj3eM&t=572s)**:** Here’s a self-indulgent recommendation. It’s a conversation between the greatest golfer of all time and the reigning PGA Champion about how they think about hitting golf shots. For golf lovers, this is the kind of conversation you’ve always hoped you could listen to. So rarely is Tiger this honest! If you’re not a golfer, this is a window into the magical complexity of the game.\n\n​[**A Writing Masterclass:**](https://amzn.to/2Oygcfa) George Saunders has spent the past twenty years teaching a Russian short story class at Syracuse University. He studied writers like Chekhov, Tolstoy, and Turgenev. The essays provide a technical explanation for why their stories have resonated for more than a century. But this book isn’t dry like most of its counterparts. It’s alive with philosophy and deep questions about human existence.\n\n**​**[**Kendrick Lamar’s “Element” Music Video**](https://youtu.be/kqGKMaCAao4)**:** Tthis was a beautiful exploration about the music video Kendrick Lamar created for “Element.” To be honest, I’ve never really understood the popularity of music videos. They rarely add meaning to the music, and as an outsider looking in, they feel like the most corporate part of the music industry. And yet, they’re consistently the most popular videos on YouTube. But the “Element” music video is an exception, as the [Nerdwriter beautifully shows here](https://youtu.be/kqGKMaCAao4).\n\n**​**[**Golf’s Holy War**](https://amzn.to/39XIask)**:** I tore through this book. It told the story of the battle between art and science in the game of golf, which I’ve been thinking about for more than a decade. Some people like [Bryson DeChambeau](https://perell.com/essay/practice-analytically-perform-intuitively/) are embracing cutting-edge tools to measure the physics of ball flight and the biomechanics of the golf swing. But others think all that new technology is destroying the game. This book is about that “holy war.”\n\n[**Destruction and Creation**](https://www.goalsys.com/books/documents/DESTRUCTION_AND_CREATION.pdf)**:** John Boyd was a US military strategist during the middle part of the 20th century. He’s known for the concept of the [OODA loop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OODA_loop), but I like this paper even more. Though he was writing about military battles, his ideas about creating an accurate model of the world apply to just about anything. He says that creativity is less about simple creation but rather a constant oscillation between destructive deduction and creative synthesis. My friend Taylor Pearson [wrote the best summary I’ve seen of the paper](https://medium.com/the-mission/the-truth-about-how-creativity-really-works-46623efb6775?%20), and here’s how he summarized it: “Destruction is related to deduction, taking the big parts and breaking them down into constituent pieces. Creation is related to induction, synthesis, and integration. It’s taking the little bits and re-building them into a coherent whole.” Or, as I [wrote](https://twitter.com/david_perell/status/1369690289762414592?s=20), divergence and convergence.\n\n**John Cleese on Creativity:** John Cleese was the inspiration for my [Beer Mode vs. Coffee Mode article](https://perell.com/note/open-mode-and-closed-mode/). He stresses the importance of free time in the creative process: “If you get into the right mood, then your mode of thinking will become much more creative. But if you’re racing around all day, ticking things off a list, looking at your watch, making phone calls, and generally just keeping all the balls in the air, you are not going to have any creative ideas.” For more, [I recommend this short video](https://youtu.be/gr2evrYB3wA) and his [short book about creativity](https://amzn.to/3coDFIY).\n\n**​**[**Lessons from Mr. Beast**](https://youtu.be/lQCZ_fXfxqs): With 52 million YouTube subscribers, Mr. Beast has become a cultural force. This 30-minute conversation is an excellent introduction to his storytelling capabilities, and in particular, how he creates tension in his videos. The lessons they present are applicable to every creative medium too.\n\n**​**[**The Courage to Be Disliked**](https://amzn.to/3fos7HH)**:** What if trauma doesn’t exist? What if all our focus on trauma traps us in the past instead of helping us look towards the future? That’s the thesis of this book by Ichiro Kishimi. It’s based on the ideas of [Alfred Adler](http://www.centroadleriano.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/EMAlfredAdler-TraumaTheory.pdf), an oft-forgotten psychologist who was a contemporary of Jung and Freud. Once again, I’m still in the exploratory phase here. But given the rise of depression and suicide rates in the West, something seems off about the psychological consensus. In Kishimi‘s words: “\\[Adler\\] is not saying that the experience of a horrible calamity or abuse during childhood or other such incidents have no influence on forming a personality; their influences are strong. But the important thing is that nothing is actually determined by those influences. We determine our own lives according to the meaning we give to those past experiences. Your life is not something that someone gives you, but something you choose yourself, and you are the one who decides how you live.” For a contrasting perspective about the harmful effects of trauma, [I recommend this summary](https://fortelabs.co/blog/the-body-keeps-the-score-summary/) about a book called *The Body Keeps the Score.*\n\n**​**[**Venkatesh Rao’s Quora Answers**](https://www.quora.com/profile/Venkatesh-Rao)**:** Venkatesh is one of those writers who has influenced almost all of my friends’ thinking but is virtually unknown outside of my social circle. That’s partially because his recent writing has been so hard to parse. But his early writing on Quora is unbelievably clear, and his article on improving your writing is a must-read.\n\n[**The But & Therefore Rule**](https://twitter.com/david_perell/status/1365438868284203009?s=20)**:** The creators of South Park share their favorite storytelling advice. Drive your story with words like “but” and “therefore” instead of “and then.”\n\n**​**[**One More Time**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QwOpRh-IfI)**:** Daft Punk, the legendary pop music duo, have split. Their hit song is called “One More Time” and this 51-second video breaks down how a 1979 song called “More Spell on You” by Eddie Johns builds a foundation for its memorable beat. Don’t just watch this video for the entertainment. Watch it because it’s a masterclass in the kind of visual education that no book could ever provide.\n\n**​**[**The Science of Storytelling**](https://amzn.to/3qTZHYR)**:** Storytelling is like an operating system for humanity. Some scientists have said that the brain is processing 11 million bits of information at any moment, even though we aren’t consciously aware of more than 40. Even though the actual numbers sound like pseudoscience to me, the general point is profound: our brains can’t make sense of all the information in the world, so we simplify it with narratives. This empirical look at how we do that will make you a better storyteller and a more effective communicator.\n\n[**Ken Burns**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aRb-_6MGl-c&ab_channel=Pew)**:** A friend texted me and said: “I think Ken Burns is the greatest storyteller in American history.” I can’t believe it, but I’ve never seen a full documentary of his. But once my friend sparked my curiosity, I listened to [this outstanding interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aRb-_6MGl-c&ab_channel=Pew). The most surprising figure was that his 11.5 hour Civil War documentary was [culled](https://twitter.com/david_perell/status/1359276142256156674?s=20) from 22.73 miles of film.\n\n**​**[**Manufacturing Intellect**](https://www.youtube.com/user/Vaipan)**:** This is the best place I’ve found to discover old interviews. While the rest of the Internet is focused on the here and now, it offers a chance to disconnect from the never-ending now and explore the wisdom of brilliant but oft-forgotten figures like [Joan Didion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=diqZhz64l9w&t=65s) and [Susan Sontag](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOCXuuFv9S8).\n\n**​**[**Rolf Degen**](<https://twitter.com/search?lang=en&q=(from%3ADegenRolf)%20min_faves%3A800&src=typed_query>)**:** The link is a collection of the most popular tweets from one of the best researchers I know. Scroll the feed and you’ll find academic studies about the psychology of trauma, gender relationships, and the [non-existent relationship between intelligence and susceptibility to foolish beliefs](https://ejop.psychopen.eu/index.php/ejop/article/view/1696). By the way, [advanced searches](https://twitter.com/search-advanced?lang=en) are one of the best ways to use Twitter. Picking an account and ranking their tweets by likes will help you find hidden gems.\n\n**​**[**How a Chess Master Concentrates**](https://aeon.co/essays/playing-chess-is-an-essential-life-lesson-in-concentration)**:** On the “Practice Analytically, Perform Intuitively” front, I enjoyed this article from a chess master with a Life Title from the World Chess Federation. This quote is one of the most beautiful things I’ve ever read about mastery: “My search to do the right thing feels fundamentally aesthetic in nature… Good moves have the qualities of truth and beauty. They are discoveries of how things are, and should be.” That’s right. Beauty and excellence become synonymous at the highest levels of performance.\n\n**Ava’s Writing:** I don’t know her last name, but Ava is one of my favorite up-and-coming Internet writers. Reading her work makes you feel like you’ve been invited into her social circle, but it stands out because she’s so absurdly observant and candid about her thoughts. At times, it even achieves what David Foster Wallace wanted for his own writing, when he said: “Most of the modern writing I like the best is both sophisticated and colloquial—that is, high-level and complicated but at the same time intimate, sort of like a smart person is sitting right there talking to you—and I think I do little more than try to achieve this same high-low blend.” Sometimes, she writes about [shame](https://ava.substack.com/p/on-shame). Sometimes, she writes about [the creative process](https://ava.substack.com/p/on-redoing-things). This week, she wrote about how [psychedelics](https://ava.substack.com/p/psychedelics-a-personal-take) influenced her mental state.\n\n**Richard Wagner:** I’ve always been familiar with Richard Wagner’s music, but only recently did I begin to understand its tense history. At once, Wagner’s work set the stage for the kinds of dramatic movie scores you see in movies like Interstellar. His music wasn’t just sound. It was theater. But at the same time, his work has always been associated with antisemitism, in part because he was Hitler’s favorite composer. But that’s what makes him such a fascinating person to study. As the music critic Alex Ross said: “With Wagner, you never leave reality, and everything sublime and magnificent and moving in Wagner is inseparable from this corruption, this darkness, this evil. And I think that makes him a very human, unfortunately, exemplary human phenomenon, where the greatness and the darkness are all mixed together because that’s who we are as a species. And Wagner really exemplifies our species, in some ways, in terms of this mixing together of creative and destructive energies all at once, and you can never separate them — if that’s not too drastic.” Damn, that’s good. To learn about Wagner, I recommend [Alex Ross’ interview with Tyler Cowen](https://conversationswithtyler.com/episodes/alex-ross/) and [this one on *Open Source*](https://radioopensource.org/wagner-and-wagnerism/)_._\n\n**[Why I Meditate](https://medium.com/@OshanJarow/why-i-meditate-3c82a1f17172):** Meditation pushes perception into the dark, pre-linguistic woods of consciousness. The stream of consciousness is not a ceaseless flow of words. Meditation is discipline in non-verbal perception. Where words fail, meditation carries the torch.\n\n**[Artist and the Machine](http://michaelnielsen.org/blog/the-artist-and-the-machine/):** A history of the interplay between human tools and human thought. Beginning with 19th century realism, [Michael Nielsen](http://perell.com/podcast/michael-nielsen) explores the history of art and perception. [Nielsen](http://perell.com/podcast/michael-nielsen) demonstrates how, as we create new tools and probe deeper into nature, we discover new aesthetics and new forms of beauty.\n\n**Theories of the World:** I have a new thesis. Many ultra-successful people have one big idea, and found success by doubling-down on it. There’s more complexity here, which you can read about in my essay [One Big Idea.](https://perell.com/essay/one-big-idea) But if you’re looking for some examples, I recommend this [series of lectures by George Soros](https://www.ft.com/video/eb6df6ec-1076-3cbc-a048-09f6374217fb) (Reflexivity) or my essay on [Peter Thiel](https://perell.com/essay/peter-thiel) (Mimetic Theory).\n\n[**Podcast with Robert Cottrell:**](https://perell.com/podcast/robert-cottrell)[_The Browser_](https://thebrowser.com/)is the best link curation service I’ve found. I spoke to its founder for 90 minutes about what it takes to acquire good taste, how different people read, and the future of language translation. You can listen to the podcast on [iTunes](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/north-star-podcast/id1170914572), [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/show/5WaTr94Kr7umvyuXYcobqA), or your go-to podcast app.\n\n[**Shock of the New:**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3ne7Udaetg)I watch lots of YouTube videos, but usually they’re shorter than this series. For the past few weeks, I’ve been watching this excellent 8-part documentary on art history, hosted by Robert Hughes. The series traces the 100-year history of modern art, from the Impressionists in 1880 to the postmodernists in 1980. And if you like the documentary, I recommend the [book with the same title.](https://amzn.to/2SaOHX3)\n\n[**The Lost Tools of Learning**](https://gbt.org/text/sayers.html)**:** A talk from poet Dorothy Sayers, given at Oxford University in 1947. In it, she argues that education began to lose its way in the Middle Ages. By bringing back the three lost tools of learning — grammar, logic, and rhetoric — we can foster self-directed learners instead of sleepwalking automatons.\n\n**Amazon’s Great Courses:** You’ll find lectures from just about every topic under the sun. I purchased two lecture series: one about the [history of Christian theology](https://amzn.to/386wCPw) another on about the [Book of Genesis](https://amzn.to/2HX1NCu). In college, I remember listening to [this series on economic history](https://amzn.to/32yhwBp), which outlined the theories of people like Adam Smith, David Ricardo, and Karl Marx.\n\n[**Minerva**](https://amzn.to/33X25TZ): This is one of the best books I’ve ever read on education. My friend [Andy Matuschak](https://andymatuschak.org/), the former Director of Research at Kahn Academy, recommended it to me. Most books about education are rooted in opinion. But this one is grounded in empirical research. It tells the story of a new university called [_Minerva_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minerva_Schools_at_KGI)*,* a San Francisco based school that re-thought education from the ground-up. Their pedagogy is based on a 1972 paper called [_Levels of processing: A framework for memory research_](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002253717280001X)*.* If you’re interested in education, this book is for you.\n\n[**Where Greatness Comes From**](https://youtu.be/MsWlktW0kj4%20)**:** I keep coming back to [this short movie clip from *Whiplash*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsWlktW0kj4)*.* In it, a drummer breaks up with his girlfriend because he wants to focus on his craft. I won’t tell you any more because I don’t want to spoil it. Apparently, *Whiplash* was one of Kobe Bryant’s favorite movies, and after you watch this short clip, you’ll understand why. Pair it with this [interview with Kobe Bryant](https://www.gq.com/story/kobe-bryant-nba-allstar) and a short article called [_Whiplash and Extreme Greatness_](https://tylerhogge.com/2015/10/07/whiplash-and-greatness/)_._\n\n[**Jack Butcher**](https://shop.visualizevalue.com/)**:** If you aren’t familiar with [Visualize Value](https://twitter.com/visualizevalue), now is the time to change that. Jack is fast becoming one of my favorite online creators. He has the two things every online illustrator needs: stellar taste and a distinct style. He illustrates famous quotes to share timeless wisdom in ways that ring in your mind long after you read them.\n\n**Childhood:** I’ve been studying the sociology of childhood. In particular, I recommend two books: [_The Disappearance of Childhood_](https://amzn.to/2Qawgl6) by Neil Postman and [_Deschooling Society_](https://amzn.to/2QcIPME)by Ivan Illich. Both of them wrote in the 70s, and offer perspectives that you won’t find in today’s mainstream commentary. Even if you aren’t interested in childhood, I recommend both authors’ backlog of books about the social effects of technology and industrialization.\n\n**Note-Taking:** I went deep down the note-taking rabbit hole. I now have a firm grasp on [Notion](https://www.notion.so/) and [Roam](https://roamresearch.com/), each of which has radically different philosophies for how information should be stored, organized, and synthesized. If you want to learn Roam, I recommend [Nat Eliason’s introductory course](https://learn.nateliason.com/). Or, if you want to explore the philosophy of note-taking, I recommend [Andy Matuschak’s notes on the subject](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/About_these_notes) (follow his hyperlinks).\n\n[**David Cole’s Cannon**](http://davidcole.me/canon/)**:** More writers should do this. Heck, I should too. A former designer at Quora shares the works of scholarship underlying his worldview. Topics include purpose, process, product, user experience, and craft. If you like design, this page is for you.\n\n**Stephanie Tolan:** You know somebody’s writing is going to be good when the articles are old, the design is ugly, and the articles are still popular. This site is Exhibit A. Stephanie writes about childhood education, mostly through the lens of gifted children. To begin, I recommend an article called [_Is it a Cheetah_](https://www.stephanietolan.com/is_it_a_cheetah.htm)_?_\n\n**Yale Courses:** I realized I knew almost nothing about Karl Marx. He’s arguably the most important philosopher of the past 200 years, and I hadn’t engaged with his ideas. Concepts like alienation, exploitation, and the labor theory of value. Yale lectures are the first place I look whenever I want to study a new subject. I start with lectures and only start reading the books once I have foundational knowledge. As for Marx, I listened to the lectures from [SOCY 151: Foundations of Modern Social Theory](https://oyc.yale.edu/sociology/socy-151/lecture-9). [Here is the YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kIlEkbU4rx0). No matter what subject you’re interested in, Yale lectures are a good place to begin.\n\n[**JUMP**](https://medium.com/@micsolana/jump-23d06adb4cb7)**:** This is about the implications of a world where everybody can broadcast their ideas, and once shared, an idea can spread to the entire world in a matter of days. File this in the “I wish I wrote this essay” category, which is the highest praise I can give.\n\n**Every Frame a Painting:** An exceptional YouTube channel with video essays that talk about how movies are made and how directors make films. I recommend this video about [how to compose visual movement](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=doaQC-S8de8) or this one on [Jackie Chan’s action scenes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1PCtIaM_GQ).\n\n[**Leisure: The Basis of Culture**](https://amzn.to/2uyDM1l): My friend recommended Andrew Taggert’s work to me, and after hearing about his [philosophy of “Total Work](https://aeon.co/ideas/if-work-dominated-your-every-moment-would-life-be-worth-living),” I went back to the source of it all: a [1948 manifesto](https://amzn.to/2PxSTiZ) about the problems with our contemporary work culture. In only 145 pages, it argues that we should learn from the Greeks, retreat from our culture of workaholism, and live a life of spiritual and intellectual nourishment. Here’s the book summary from [Brain Pickings.](https://www.brainpickings.org/2015/08/10/leisure-the-basis-of-culture-josef-pieper/)\n\n[**Contemporary Art**](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLTRal7R3G0f8E9rOf82XbZiBhL6IxzDCJ)**:** I’ve fast become a huge fan of John David Ebert. He is able to summarize shifts in art, media, and culture as well as anybody I know. I’ve been floating between his summaries of Spengler’s [_Decline of the West_](https://amzn.to/38roRnK)and the work of [Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkk16Pfmx-k). I found [this 59-part series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLTRal7R3G0f8E9rOf82XbZiBhL6IxzDCJ) on contemporary art, based on his book [_Art After Metaphysics_](https://amzn.to/32XavKL)_._\n\n**Robert Sapolsky Lectures:** You know me. I love a good lecture series. Sapolsky is one of those professors whose enthusiasm radiates through his talks. Much of his work covers the impact of stress and spiked cortisol on the mind, much of which is inspired by his work with baboons in Kenya. Eventually, you may enjoy his [25-part series on human behavioral biology](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL150326949691B199), but start [with excellent this 52-minute lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOAgplgTxfc) about depression — which is a must-watch for anybody interested in mental health.\n\n[**The Danger of Silence**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiKtZgImdlY&feature=share)**:** I first found this 4-minute slam poetry video from Clint Smith when I was in college. I’m blown away by it every time I come back to it. In the video, Smith reminds us to read critically, write consciously, speak clearly, and tell your truth. To me, this is the pinnacle of public speaking.\n\n[**Mary Oliver Interview with Krista Tippett**](https://onbeing.org/programs/mary-oliver-listening-to-the-world/)**:** Mary Oliver passed away, but her memory lives on through this rare interview with Krista Tippett. I recommend it as a starting point for the entire [On Being](https://onbeing.org/) podcast. She explores the spiritual life of writers, entrepreneurs, and religious figures with an emotional tenderness you won’t find on any other show. When you listen to one of Krista’s podcasts, you know you’re going to investigate the choir of the soul and the mystery of the universe. The environment she creates is as contemplative as a meditation retreat and as homey as the stuffed animal you used to hug as a kid.\n\n**TV Tropes:** I love finding websites that remind me how little I know about the world. TV Tropes is a pop-culture wiki that catalogs common plot devices, archetypes, and tropes in all forms of media. The site is a little hard to navigate, but if you like storytelling, you’re going to have a blast exploring it. I suggest starting with this page on [Flanderization](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Flanderization) or this one about [why everything sounds sexier in French](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EverythingSoundsSexierInFrench).\n\n**​**[**David Whyte is an Everyday Poet**](https://www.dumbofeather.com/conversations/david-whyte-is-an-everyday-poet/)**:** If the first three links were for the mind, this one is for the heart. Whyte is particularly insightful on the tension between serving the wallet and serving the soul. But there are so many wonderful points in here about the art of conversation, the tradeoffs that come with commitment, and the virtues of craftsmanship. [Here’s the full interview](https://www.dumbofeather.com/conversations/david-whyte-is-an-everyday-poet/).\n\n**Good Old Neon**: Of all the David Foster Wallace short stories, this is my favorite one. It’s a difficult window into the mind of a depressed person, narrated by a ghost from beyond the grave. Given that the author took his life a couple years after it was published, I suspect that it was a way to grapple with the warfare inside his own mind. [Here’s the audiobook](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f-Q9GHmJGc), and here’s a [free 41-page PDF](http://sdavidmiller.com/octo/files/no_google2/GoodOldNeon.pdf). The heaviness of it reminds me of *[The Death of Ivan Ilyich](https://amzn.to/38qeYtA)* by Leo Tolstoy, which I equally recommend.\n\n**Liberal Arts:** The West’s faith in the liberal arts is declining and I’m on a mission to find out why. To do so, I tore through Fareed Zakaria’s short book, [_In Defense of a Liberal Education_](https://amzn.to/3an1Zs7)*,* which argues for the benefits of studying ideas from different disciplines and using college to expose students to many ways of thinking. In my study, I was happy to find a series of annual lectures at the University of Chicago called The Aims of Education. [Here’s the archive of speakers](https://college.uchicago.edu/student-life/aims-education). You can find most of the speeches with a Google search. In particular, I enjoyed [Robert Maynard Hutchins’ speech](http://www.ditext.com/hutchins/ae.html) from 1943.\n\n**Liberal Arts:** I enjoyed Fareed Zakaria’s [_In Defense of a Liberal Education_](https://amzn.to/3j36MC5)*.* I also read [_Beyond the University_](https://amzn.to/2Ypz95o)by Michael Roth, which was a historical deep dive into how the liberal arts became what they are today. I recommend them both. If you’re looking for a personal narrative, read Zakaria’s book, and if you’re looking for history, read Roth’s.\n\n[**Porter Robinson Interview**](https://www.thelineofbestfit.com/features/longread/porter-robinson-ego-death-interview)**:** Woah, this is the best thing I’ve read about the creative process in a long, long time. I don’t know if it’s really good or if I’m just such a big Porter Robinson fan that anything he says will entertain me. Probably a little bit of both. If you do creative work, you will resonate with [what he’s saying](https://www.thelineofbestfit.com/features/longread/porter-robinson-ego-death-interview).\n\n**How Music Works**: While we’re on the topic of music, I recommend [_How Music Works_](https://www.amazon.com/How-Music-Works-David-Byrne/dp/0804188939/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=how+music+works&qid=1598631414&sr=8-1)by David Byrne. It’s written for a mass audience of people who like music enough to attend live concerts but haven’t studied it formally. Just like me. If you want to read a review of the book first, [consider this one from the New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/23/books/review/david-byrnes-how-music-works.html).\n\n**Christopher Alexander:** The news of Alexander’s death is heartbreaking to me. He was the person who best articulated how spaces can feel alive, whether they are a collection of atoms or bits. To date, [_A Timeless Way of Building_](https://amzn.to/2DNPJV2) is one of the best books I’ve ever read because of the principles it presents for quality design — and by extension, a quality life. The book is written so masterfully that I feel a spiritual connection to it. Some of my favorites are: (1) Change the walking surface and the light quality to create a “transition space” between home and street, (2) the best rooms have light from two sides, and (3) in the northern hemisphere, if you want to maximize the natural light in your home, make sure the southern side has large windows. If you’d like to learn more about Alexander’s work, I recommend [this Twitter account](https://mobile.twitter.com/apatterntolearn) and [this talk by Ryan Singer](https://vimeo.com/491222729).\n\n[**Swedish House Mafia**](https://twitter.com/danielgross/status/1301956935936282627?s=20)**:** I love watching creativity in action. This video is a behind-the-scenes of the making of One. Notice how the DJs are throwing out ideas, keeping what works, and throwing away the rest — all while having fun. [Here’s the extended video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jHy47m80bs) with Swedish House Mafia playing the song at Ultra. I like it because it shows how an idea can go from an experiment in a studio to the night of a lifetime for 80,000 people.\n\n[**K-Pop**](https://dormin.org/2020/09/06/a-deep-dive-into-k-pop/)**:** These are the kinds of articles that make the Internet great. This deep-dive on K-Pop focused on why it’s so popular, how it represents an alternative to Western pop music, why the fandom is so intense, the arduous process of becoming a K-Pop star, and why it’s such a centralized and hierarchical industry.\n\n**Beautiful Performances:** Living with five friends has introduced me to all kinds of videos I wouldn’t have found otherwise. Two things stand out: [Alicia Keys’ performance at the Grammy’s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPbwJQ1XR4c) where she honors songs she wishes she’d written and this [Michael Jackson performance of Billie Jean](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv2vixtkFu0) where the audience is moved to tears by his performance.\n\n**​**[**Brunello Cucinelli**](https://om.co/2015/04/27/brunello-cucinelli-2/)**:** This is an interview for the ages. He’s the founder of an eponymously named Italian fashion brand, which makes cashmere sweaters and earns more than $450 million per year in revenue. The interview is a trip through his philosophy of life and business, based on the pillars of dignity, beauty, and soul. If you’re eager for more, [here are my favorite lessons](https://twitter.com/david_perell/status/1315426534900092929?lang=en) from Cucinelli.\n\n**David Whyte:** Whyte is an English poet, and I can’t stop listening to his interviews. He made me see how humiliation is a terrible feeling but a beautiful word. It comes from the Latin word humus, which means soil. So being humiliated is like returning to the ground of your being. Only by shedding those illusions of selfhood do you confront your own fragility. I recommend his interviews with [Sam Harris](https://samharris.org/podcasts/184-conversational-nature-reality/) and [Krista Tippett](https://onbeing.org/programs/david-whyte-the-conversational-nature-of-reality/). As you listen, your soul will fill up with the warmth of a fireplace on a cold winter night.\n\n**James Turrell:** An American artist known for his work with light and space. Like [Yayoi Kusama](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yayoi_Kusama), his work is made for our hyper-visual age, where art is photographed and shared on small screens. Almost all of Turell’s work is magnificent, but he’s at his best when he’s playing with rectangles. For an introduction to his art, I recommend [this short article](https://www.pacegallery.com/artists/james-turrell/), [his *New York Times* profile](https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/16/magazine/how-james-turrell-knocked-the-art-world-off-its-feet.html), or this [interview from the Los Angeles County Museum of Art](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0g6JFYRKxQ).\n\n[**Letters to a Young Poet**](https://amzn.to/3jK6pfJ)**:** A collection of letters from Rainer Maria Rilke, published in 1929. They double as a manual about living as an artist and doing creative work. Two creative virtues stand out: solitude and patience. The book is short enough to read in one sitting, but the writing is so beautiful that you’ll want to stop, put your book down, and reflect on the wisdom within it. Though it’s about poetry, anybody who does creative work will enjoy it.\n\n[**99% Invisible**](https://99percentinvisible.org/)**:** A show about all the thought that goes into the things we don’t think about, particularly in architecture and design. To date, this show is responsible for more of my Internet rabbit holes than just about any source I can think of. I recommend this two-part series about the [Bijlmeer](https://99percentinvisible.org/episode/bijlmer-city-future-part-1/) or this one about the [carpet at the Portland airport](https://99percentinvisible.org/episode/pdx-carpet/). Every podcast comes with a full transcript, so you can choose how you want to enjoy the ideas.\n\n[**Epic School in Oklahoma**](https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2020/09/on-line-education-in-oklahoma-from-my-email-box.html)**:** There’s an online charter school in Oklahoma called Epic, which has 38,000 students and where teachers can earn more than $100,000 per year. The school was made possible by a law that gave online-only charter schools a separate regulatory structure from physical schools and didn’t have an enrollment cap. Epic is hated by most people in the traditional education industry. They’ve been the subject of multiple lawsuits, mostly around alleged fraud, but none of them have been resolved.\n\n[**Gareth Hinds**](https://www.garethhinds.com/)**:** This author re-creates famous books with beautiful hand-drawn images. I particularly recommend them for people with kids. It might be fun to read the original book yourself, but share the picture-books with your kids so you can talk about the famous stories together. I immediately purchased his graphic novels about [_The Odyssey_](https://www.garethhinds.com/wp/the-odyssey/) and [_Gifts from the Gods_](https://garethhinds.com/wp/gifts-from-the-gods/)*,* which is all about the wisdom of Greek mythology. If you purchase the books, get a paper version instead of a digital one.\n\n[**How Malcolm X Learned to Read**](http://accounts.smccd.edu/bellr/readerlearningtoread.htm)**:** Here’s an inspiring story if there ever was one. [Malcolm X](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_X) learned to read by reading the dictionary and learning each word, one-by-one. Crazy, right? He was in prison at the time, and as his vocabulary broadened, he binge-read books in the isolation of his prison cell. As he recounted: “When I had progressed to really serious reading, every night at about ten P.M. I would be outraged with the “lights out.” It always seemed to catch me right in the middle of something engrossing. Fortunately, right outside my door was a corridor light that cast a glow into my room. The glow was enough to read by, once my eyes adjusted to it. So when “lights out” came, I would sit on the floor where I could continue reading in that glow. [Here’s the full story.](http://accounts.smccd.edu/bellr/readerlearningtoread.htm)\n\n---\n\n## History, Science, & Math\n\n**What it Means to be a Historian:** And… now I’m obsessed with David McCullough’s work. I devoured his [Wright Brothers biography](https://amzn.to/3gmPIIq), and now I’m pouring through his interviews. So far, my top recommendation is an interview and lecture he gave at a [_National Endowment for the Humanities_](https://www.neh.gov/about/awards/jefferson-lecture/david-mccullough-biography) ceremony. It’s no coincidence that McCullough, like many top writers, is a painter. To write is to be a professional observationalist. You have to look more closely than others. Nothing illuminates the wondrous complexity of sight like trying to paint what you see.\n\n**​**[**Alexey Guzey, on Sleep**](https://guzey.com/theses-on-sleep/)**:** It’s so rare for somebody to question the idea that more sleep is better. This is a fairly compelling argument against not sleeping so much, though I think the comparisons to fasting and weightlifting are over-stated, mostly because I hate being tired so much. Here’s how the author summarizes the piece: (1) since comfortable sleep is an unnatural modern phenomenon, we should expect sleepiness to be normal, like hunger; (2) depression comes from oversleeping, while mania comes from acute sleep deprivation; (3) occasional acute sleep deprivation is good for your health and promotes more efficient sleep; (4) we should be skeptical of the consensus on sleep research; (5) decreasing your sleep by 1-2 hours per night won’t have serious negative side-effects in the long-term. Of everything here, I’d like to see more research about the idea that your sleep can become more efficient in the long run. For now, the only change I’m going to make is pulling all-nighters every once in a while if I get into a writing trance.\n\n**Brian Keating:** I became friends with Brian after he hosted me on his podcast, [_Into the Impossible_](https://podbay.fm/p/into-the-impossible/e/1619006400) and he’s fast become one of my favorite dinner partners and astrophysicists. He speaks so clearly about the universe that, even though you’re talking about mind-bending distances and time scales, you feel like you’re talking to a friend at the bar. If you want to dive into his work, I recommend [his explanation of the origins of the universe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJa1eKC0GZg) on Lex Fridman’s podcast or [this explainer about time on his YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09fSrhhfRwE). If you’re looking to explore the universe, let Brian be your guide.\n\n**​**[**Einstein’s Dreams**](https://amzn.to/3mgxjyp)**:** A splendid collection of short stories from the philosopher-physicist Alan Lightman. All of them are about time, relativity, and physics as if they were the dreams of Albert Einstein. My favorite one is about [body time vs. mechanical time](https://twitter.com/david_perell/status/1299778651118952449?s=20). Body time is the world of hunger, moods, and circadian rhythms, while mechanical time is the world of clocks and alarms. It’d be fun to swing between these tempos at different times of the year. To help myself enter the calm flow of body time, I’ve deliberately chosen not to put any clocks in my home.\n\n**​**[**Breath**](https://amzn.to/3EweizH)**:** The average person will take 670 million breaths in their lifetime. And yet, even if they listen to you breathe, doctors rarely check on their patients’ respiratory rate or the balance between oxygen and carbon dioxide in their bodies. Maybe it’s time to change that. Among mammals, humans are uniquely bad at breathing, which partially explains why we’re the only ones to routinely have overbites and misaligned jaws. One major issue is that humans increasingly breathe through their mouths instead of their noses. Mouth breathing is the number one cause of cavities — not sugar, bad hygiene, or a poor diet. This book instantly inspired me to change my behavior. To encourage nose breathing, I’m now sleeping with [tape](https://amzn.to/3Fpigvf) over my mouth.\n\n​[**Mechanical Paradise**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3ne7Udaetg)**:** How did the machine transform human consciousness? At first, the Eiffel Tower promised unlimited control over the world. Standing at the top made humans feel like birds and, by extension, guardians of the future. The view from the top was as breathtaking as the sight of the Earth from the moon almost 80 years later. Around that time, Ford rolled out the car, Edison invented sound recording, and Einstein invented the Theory of Relativity — the basis of the largest change in humanity’s view of the universe since Newton. As this documentary shows, the perspective shift is most evident in the art of the age. Specifically, in two shifts: one from nature to machine, and another from impressionism to cubism.\n\n[**Why Sperm Counts are Declining**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Ne8ZbYxjKs)**:** Male sperm counts of Western men dropped by 59 percent between 1979 and 2011. The quality of that sperm declined too, as the percentage of damaged DNA increased. Maybe that’s why the [miscarriage rate](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/05/books/review/shanna-swan-count-down.html) has risen by 1 percent per year over the past two decades. What’s going on? Our environment is partially to blame due to pollution from chemicals like Bisphenol A, which interferes with the conception process and increases the likelihood of a miscarriage. This interview explores the impact of declining fertility and the increase in gender fluidity and what both trends say about the health of humanity.\n\n**​**[**Slowed Progress in Science**](https://www.pnas.org/content/118/41/e2021636118)**:** Here’s a theory I’ve never considered: What if scientific progress is slowing because there are *too many* papers being published? What if, out of a desire to increase the rate of scientific progress, we’ve actually made it hard for scientists to grapple with transformative ideas? That’s the thesis of this paper. Basically, the authors argue that past a certain point, the more papers that are published in a given field, the more citations flow to already well-cited papers — which ossifies the canon.\n\n**​**[**Civilization**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxEJn7dWY60)**:** A 13-part documentary on the history of art, culture, and philosophy since the Dark Ages. When it was published in the 1960s, it received unprecedented viewing numbers for a high art series. More than 2.5 million people watched it in Britain. In America, that number totaled more than 5 million. Each episode is about an hour. The documentary was so popular that it inspired a book on the same subject.\n\n**​**[**The World Chessboard**](https://unchartedterritories.tomaspueyo.com/p/world-chessboard)**:** Man, this series of articles is everything that history class should have been. The premise is that geography creates certain inevitable outcomes in the game of human achievement. This piece is about America’s advantages. Specifically, it has huge oceans on two sides and more miles of internal navigable waterways *than the rest of the world combined.* Yeah, you read that right.\n\n​[**The Shape of Failure**](https://www.edge.org/conversation/nassim_nicholas_taleb-understanding-is-a-poor-substitute-for-convexity-antifragility)**:** Word for word, this is one of my favorite things Nassim Taleb has ever written. But somehow, people rarely recommend it. Taleb explains the math behind cultivating serendipity in your life. By creating “convex” payoff functions for yourself (where the upside of success is greater than the downside of failure), you can systematically create long-term gains for yourself.\n\n[**The History of Silicon Valley**](https://twitter.com/holland_tom/status/1434769795979825153?s=20): Marc Andreessen was one of the first people to ignite my intellectual curiosity. I still remember the way his tweets made ideas come alive when I was living in North Carolina, and I’m bummed that he stopped being so prolific. I enjoyed this two-part series where he narrates the history of Silicon Valley with the kind of clarity that only somebody who was in the trenches can deliver.\n\n​[**The Current and the Wind**](https://seths.blog/2021/07/the-current-and-the-wind/)**:** Our society is stuck in a [Never-Ending Now](https://perell.com/essay/never-ending-now/), where we’re obsessed with the present and blind to history. I love the way Seth Godin describes a similar phenomenon in this article about sailing. While inexperienced sailors focus on the ever-changing wind, experienced ones study the currents because they persist through time and often have a bigger effect.\n\n**Life History Theory:** A fascinating theory of genetics, most of which was developed in the 1950s. Basically, the theory explores the biological tradeoffs animals make to adapt to their environment. For example, some animals focus on increasing the number of children they produce, while others have fewer kids but devote more attention to them. As for humans, we have uniquely large brains, long lifespans, and a later age of first reproduction. This [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_history_theory) and [six-part essay series](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/beautiful-minds/201007/life-in-the-fast-lane-part-i-evolution-the-fast-life) provide good overviews.\n\n**​**[**The Beauty of Golf**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_z0kwG-Xp0M)**:** This one is for all my fellow golfers. Growing up, I used to play a little nine-hole golf course called Northwood, which was located 90 minutes north of San Francisco. It’s designed by Alister MacKenzie, the architect behind two of the best courses in the world: Augusta National and Cypress Point. This [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_z0kwG-Xp0M) does a masterful job telling the story of the course, its owners, and the beauty of the game. If you like golf, it’s a must-watch.\n\n**​**[**Reality Has a Surprising Amount of Detail**](http://johnsalvatier.org/blog/2017/reality-has-a-surprising-amount-of-detail)**:** Speaking of [the 50 ideas that have influenced me the most](https://perell.com/essay/50-ideas-that-changed-my-life/), it might be time to add another one to the list: Reality has a surprising amount of detail. The idea comes from this [outstanding essay](http://johnsalvatier.org/blog/2017/reality-has-a-surprising-amount-of-detail), and it applies to just about every discipline. People overestimate what they know and underestimate the complexity of the world. If you enjoy the essay, I also recommend [this derivative piece](https://taylorpearson.me/overconfidence-bias/?vgo_ee=JWFzqyY8ifV6vob2S73f%2FXwFoqDlMHNmyq65fGLdufk%3D).\n\n**J.D. Unwin:** As a historian, [Unwin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._D._Unwin) studied 86 societies and civilizations to see if there was a relationship between sexual morality and human flourishing. He found a direct relationship between promiscuity and cultural decline. Cultures where people remained virgins until marriage were much more likely to be an “[advanced civilization](https://twitter.com/FoundationDads/status/1410242536678035456?s=20).” Combined with rationality, that prenuptial chastity sets the conditions for a successful society. I’m skeptical of big history claims like this, but after [reading this summary](https://www.kirkdurston.com/blog/unwin) of his [book](https://amzn.to/3htScEt), I’m looking forward to a deeper exploration of his work.\n\n**​**[**A Guide to Demographics**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9zH1dWeKE0)**:** I put on my scavenger hat whenever I write these emails. Most of all, I love finding old things on the Internet that have retained their relevance. Demographics are one of the most dependable ways to predict the future, so I enjoyed [this three-minute cross-cultural analysis from Peter Zeihan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9zH1dWeKE0). Globally, the world’s population is aging. One of America’s biggest advantages in the next decade is a young population.\n\n​[**Pepsi’s Giant Military**](https://nickyoder.com/5-minute-history-pepsi/)**:** As part of his budding 5-minute history series, Nick Yoder wrote about how Pepsi once had the 6th largest military in the world. Yeah, you read that right. The soda company had 20 warships, 17 submarines, and a destroyer.\n\n**​**[**Peer-Reviewed Knowledge**](https://twitter.com/karakemark/status/1398643830161920006?s=10): A short video about the limits of peer-reviewed knowledge. Yes, we should be skeptical of anecdotal ideas and celebrate the scientific method. But that doesn’t mean we should discount the wisdom of intuition and observation. There are many claims that are obviously true even if we don’t have an academic paper to support them. As Paul Chek said so forcefully: “I don’t need a randomised controlled trial to know that a kick in the testicles is going to hurt.”\n\n**​**[**We Should Drink Less Alcohol**](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2013/03/28/mark-kleiman-on-why-we-need-to-solve-our-alcohol-problem-to-solve-our-crime-problem/)**:** It seems like every time I look into the science of alcohol, I realize how unhealthy it is. And it’s not just health. It’s all the stupid stuff you do when you drink because of the way alcohol lowers your time horizons. [Half the people in prison](https://democracyjournal.org/magazine/28/smart-on-crime/) were drinking when they committed their crime (though the causality is hard to measure). Here, one researcher makes the case that any drug policy that doesn’t include “raise alcohol taxes” is missing the point. That said, I’m still not ready to quit 100%.\n\n​[**A History of Private Life**](https://amzn.to/3lOvRm8)**:** A five-volume set that reveals how people lived in the ancient world. I’ve only read [the first one](https://amzn.to/3hX3SkT), which covers the era from Pagan Rome to Byzantium. Author Paul Veyne shows how idleness was considered a virtue in the ancient world. [Leisure was considered the essence of a well-lived life](https://perell.com/essay/dont-kill-time/), which is the opposite of today’s cities where saying “I’m busy” has become such a status symbol. If you’re interested in the everyday lives of people in the ancient world, this series is for you.\n\n**​**[**Are the Gospels Mythical?**](https://www.firstthings.com/article/1996/04/are-the-gospels-mythical)**:** Friends often say that the Gospels are mythical because they resemble some of history’s most popular myths. Here, Rene Girard attempts to dispel that myth. Basically, he claims that the Gospels are unique because the victim is innocent. Though this article isn’t that long, it’s extremely dense. If you want to dive into Girard’s work, start with [my long-form essay about Peter Thiel](https://perell.com/essay/peter-thiel/) where I discuss his ideas in depth.\n\n**​**[**What the Hell Happened in 1971?**](https://wtfhappenedin1971.com/)**:** Something eerie happened in the early 1970s, and this website has the data to back it up. For example, wage growth stagnated for the bottom 90% of workers, leading to rising inequality. City growth froze too. In 1970, Los Angeles was zoned for 10 million people. By 2010, the city was zoned for only 4.3 million people, and the rate of new housing developments has fallen since the 1970s. Adjusted for population growth, we have about [350% fewer housing starts](https://twitter.com/david_perell/status/1220223237629661184?s=20) than we did in 1971.\n\n**​**[**The Mathematics of Beauty**](https://www.gwern.net/docs/psychology/okcupid/themathematicsofbeauty.html)**:** If you want to consistently find interesting ideas, find a corner of the world where there’s an explosion in the amount of data we have about it. Then, follow the writers who make sense of it all. One example is the OkCupid blog. To the best of my knowledge, many of the best posts have been removed from the Internet because they were so spicy. That said, you’ll find many of the ideas in a book called [_Dataclysm_](https://amzn.to/3qeZa2A)*.* But some of them were saved, such as [this one](https://www.gwern.net/docs/psychology/okcupid/themathematicsofbeauty.html) from Gwern. For an interesting rabbit hole, check out the recommendations on the right side of the page.\n\n**​**[**Martin Luther Rewired Your Brain**](https://thisviewoflife.com/martin-luther-rewired-your-brain/)**:** Joseph Henrich is the kind of person who I stop everything for when he publishes a new article. That’s why [interviewing him](https://perell.com/podcast/joe-henrich-what-makes-society-smart/) a couple of months ago was so enjoyable. His most recent article is about how the printing press rewired our minds, with empirical data coming from the post-Protestant Revolution era.\n\n**​**[**Shock of the New**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Shock_of_the_New): A [book](https://amzn.to/3hAbOGB) and a [documentary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3ne7Udaetg) from the famous art critic, Robert Hughes. It’s by far the best thing I’ve seen about the history of modern art, from the 1870s to the 1970s. It focuses on a variety of themes, from the failure of modern architecture, to the rise of pop culture, to the legacy of the world wars, to the transition from impressionism to cubism (which is my favorite part of art history). It’s a dazzling piece of scholarship and I can’t recommend it enough.\n\n**​**[**The Tyranny of Numbers**](https://thomasjbevan.substack.com/p/the-tyranny-of-numbers)**:** We live in a society where the numbers have the final say. When revenue goes up, the business is healthy. When GDP goes up, so does the economy. But focusing too much on numbers can lead to adverse side effects. Not everything that counts can be counted. By obsessing over numerical improvements, we often ignore the aspects of life that can’t be measured and lose sight of what ultimately matters.\n\n[**How All This Happened**](http://www.collaborativefund.com/blog/how-this-all-happened/) — A short economic history of America since World War II. Things were very uncertain, then they were very good, then pretty bad, then really good, then really bad, and now here we are. [Morgan Housel](https://perell.com/podcast/morgan-housel-writing-for-the-internet/) outlines a narrative that links all the events together.\n\n**Andrew Batson:** If you want to learn more about China, I recommend Andrew Batson’s blog. He writes for Gavekal as their Director of Chinese Research. Start with this post on the [battle for ideas in China](https://andrewbatson.com/2020/01/07/who-won-the-battle-of-ideas-in-china/).\n\n[**Peace of Westphalia**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peace_of_Westphalia)**:** The Thirty Years’ War was one of the most deadly periods in European history, and led to the deaths of roughly 8 million people. The violence was settled with a series of peace treaties in 1648. Scholars have identified the treaties as the beginning of the modern international system, and in particular, the concept of sovereign states.\n\n[**Bowling Alone**](http://www.directory-online.com/Rotary/Accounts/6970/Downloads/4381/Bowling%20Alone%20Article.pdf)**:** Robert Putnam’s book [_Bowling Alone_](https://amzn.to/36Honch)is one of the most influential pieces of American sociology ever written. In it, he talks about the decline of social life in America, including the fall in church membership, attendance at public meetings, and the number of Americans who participate in associations. This is an [excellent summary of the book](http://www.directory-online.com/Rotary/Accounts/6970/Downloads/4381/Bowling%20Alone%20Article.pdf).\n\n**Singapore:** A [series of four outstanding Reddit posts](https://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/ceajmw/book_review_from_third_world_to_first_by_lee_kuan/), which summarized Lee Kuan Yew’s book, \\*From Third World to First\\***_._** The posts will take you a few hours to read, but you’ll leave with a deep understanding of how the country operates. If these ideas interest you, you’ll also enjoy my essay on the [history of Singapore](https://perell.com/essay/story-of-singapore).\n\n[**How to Remove CO2 From the Sky**](https://www.orbuch.com/carbon-removal)**:** These are exactly the kinds of articles we need more of. Anything that touches climate change is politicized, so when I find an article from a trusted source, I have to share it. The author (friend of a friend, so I trust him) spoke with more than one hundred experts to write a beginner’s guide to Negative Emissions Technologies.\n\n[**Space in High Definition**](https://www.eso.org/public/images/eso1242a/zoomable/)**:** An ultra-high quality photo of the stars and the sky. Open it on a computer browser, zoom in as much as you can, and open your heart to the vastness of the universe.\n\n**Mushrooms and the Birth of Christianity**: Okay, this one is a mind-bender. It falls under the probably-not-true-but-super-interesting category. [John M. Allegro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_M._Allegro) was an archaeologist and who studied the Dead Sea Scrolls. His book, [_The Sacred Mushroom and the Cross_](https://amzn.to/2OSPlHO) was particularly controversial because it argues that Christianity began as a shamanistic cult. Then, when the Gospels were written down, the Evangelists confused the meaning of the scrolls, which means the entire Christian tradition is based on a misunderstanding of them. One scholar called it “possibly the single most ludicrous book on Jesus scholarship by a qualified academic,” and Allegro was banished from the academy after it was published. Honestly, I have no idea if his claims have any legitimacy. I don’t know how to evaluate them, but [this article](http://www.egodeath.com/WassonEdenTree.htm) does a thorough job arguing that we should look into Allegro’s theories again.\n\n[**Open**](https://amzn.to/3a5RtV1)**:** This is an excellent biography of Andrei Agassi, the former #1 tennis player in the world. It’s an emotional journey through the sacrifices required to become a top-tier athlete. For example, even when he was the world’s top tennis player, Agassi didn’t enjoy tennis. And as it turns out, the book’s ghostwriter named J.R. Moehringer also penned [_Shoe Dog_](https://amzn.to/393uc50)*,* the biography of Phil Knight, which tells the story of Nike.\n\n[**How Airplanes Fly**](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/no-one-can-explain-why-planes-stay-in-the-air/)**:** The physics of flight has interested me ever since I was a kid. I took flying lessons during high school, in part because of a program for Bay Area teenagers called *Young Eagles,* which allowed kids like myself to fly airplanes for free. Yes, it was as cool as it sounds. To this day, I still turn my head whenever a plane flies above me. [This article explains](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/no-one-can-explain-why-planes-stay-in-the-air/) the science of aerodynamics as well as anything I’ve ever seen.\n\n**Will Durant:** What a criminally under-rated author. Along with his wife Ariel, he wrote [an 11-volume, 13,974-page tome](https://amzn.to/2y2tdoR) on the history of human civilization. From what I hear, it’s as thorough as anything that exists. But what if you don’t have time to read thousands of pages? Well, I have good news for you. Towards the end of his life, Durant summarized his learnings in three short books: [_Lessons of History_](https://perell.com/essay/history)is for your mind, [_The Story of Philosophy_](https://amzn.to/2yIRMaw)is for your heart, and [_Fallen Leaves_](https://amzn.to/2xkPEFJ) is for your soul.\n\n**3Blue1Brown:** Grant Sanderson (one of my [podcast guests](https://perell.com/podcast/grant-sanderson-math-for-the-masses)) makes excellent math-related videos on YouTube. You’ll find videos on topics like linear algebra, neural networks, calculus, the math of Bitcoin, and quantum mechanics. With every video, he turns abstract symbols into concrete visualizations. Then, he adds narrative to a mathematical concept. Start with this video on the virality of [Coronavirus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kas0tIxDvrg) or [this series about calculus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUvTyaaNkzM).\n\n**Edge:** This website is a hidden treasure. On it, you’ll find all kinds of interviews with great writers and articles about forgotten scientific ideas. I don’t know how this website has managed to fly under the radar for so long, but it’s worthy of your attention. Start with [this essay on Composers as Gardners](https://www.edge.org/conversation/brian_eno-composers-as-gardeners), [this one on the problems with String Theory](https://www.edge.org/response-detail/25547), or this [interview with Rory Sutherland](https://www.edge.org/conversation/rory_sutherland-things-to-hang-on-your-mental-mug-tree).\n\n[**Requiem for the American Dream**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZnuc-Fv_Tc): A [book](https://amzn.to/2ziZw3w) and a [documentary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZnuc-Fv_Tc) from Noam Chomsky, focused on 10 principles for the concentration of wealth and power. Chomsky tells the story of how society has transformed from the 1970s to now by focusing on ten themes: democracy, ideology, redesigning the economy, shifting the burden, attacking solidarity, running the regulators, engineering elections, keeping the rabble in line, manufacturing consent, and marginalizing the population. If you agree with everything he’s saying, you’re not thinking hard enough. But Chomsky’s bold perspectives will force you to take a stand. And if you want a summary, [here’s the Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Requiem_for_the_American_Dream).\n\n[**A Brief History of the Corporation**](https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2011/06/08/a-brief-history-of-the-corporation-1600-to-2100/): If you’ve never heard of *Ribbonfarm,* it’s time to change that. It’s mostly written by Venkatesh Rao who is absolutely brilliant, even though he’s often more obscure than I’d like. This essay about the corporation is one of the best things he’s ever written. I also recommend essays like [_The Throughput of Learning_](https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2017/01/31/the-throughput-of-learning/)and [_A Big Little Idea Called Legibility_](https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2010/07/26/a-big-little-idea-called-legibility/)_._\n\n[**The Plague in Literature and Life**](https://www.theaquilareport.com/the-plague-in-literature-and-life/): This essay builds on [Rene Girard’s Mimetic Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ren%C3%A9_Girard) and Dostoyevsky’s [_Crime and Punishment_](https://amzn.to/2A3pCYN)novel to show that the social anarchy after a plague is usually worse than the plague itself.\n\n[**The Story of Oprah Winfrey**](https://www.acquired.fm/episodes/oprah-harpo-studios)**:** Oprah might be the most successful media personality in American history. This two-hour podcast episode is the best explanation of her story I’ve seen, from the adversity she faced as a teenager to becoming one of the wealthiest women in the world.\n\n[**Outbreak**](https://meltingasphalt.com/interactive/outbreak/): This is the best COVID-19 related visualization I’ve seen. It was created by Kevin Simler, one of my all-time favorite writers. It’s a “playable simulation,” meaning that you can change the variables to visualize how they impact the spread of a disease. If you like these visualizations, I also recommend this one from the [_Washington Post_](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/world/corona-simulator/)_._\n\n[**Nicky Case**](https://ncase.me/): Building upon the theme of playable simulations, I recommend Nicky Case’s entire website. The [complex systems](https://ncase.me/attractors/) simulation is my favorite, but I also recommend this interactive comic on the science of memory, and this one about [game theory](https://ncase.me/trust/), which is inspired by a book called *The Evolution of Trust*, which I [summarized here](https://perell.com/essay/why-people-cooperate). If nothing else, these visualizations are a window into the future of online writing.\n\n[**Labor Supply and the Attention Tax**](https://kortina.nyc/essays/kinky-labor-supply-and-the-attention-tax/)**:** A long-form essay about why labor force participation has declined for men between ages 20-34. The authors propose that the drop in labor participation rate of young men is a result of a combination of factors: (i) a decrease in cost of access to media entertainment leisure, (ii) increases in both the availability and (iii) quality media entertainment leisure, and (iv) a decrease in the marginal signaling utility of (conspicuous) consumption goods for all but the highest earners.\n\n[**Ole Peters**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1vXAHGIpfc)**:** A fascinating talk by a researcher from the Santa Fe Institute. It’s about ergodicity, which is one of the most insightful ideas I’ve heard in the past few years. Peters builds upon Boltzmann’s 1870 probability theory and cutting edge mathematics to question economic doctrines. His conclusion is surprisingly accessible and impacts how we think about risk, market stability, and economic inequality.\n\n[**Superforecasting**](https://dominiccummings.com/2016/11/24/a-review-of-tetlocks-superforecasting-2015/)**:** This [book](https://amzn.to/37IOSA2) (written by Philip Tetlock) is long, but everybody should be familiar with it. Luckily, Dominic Cummings wrote an [excellent primer](https://dominiccummings.com/2016/11/24/a-review-of-tetlocks-superforecasting-2015/).\n\n[**Unlimited Information is Transforming Society**](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/unlimited-information-is-transforming-society/)**:** This article is pure fun. It’s basically a short, “Big History” piece. It tells the story of how technologies like electricity, nuclear energy, and heavier than air flight evolved and shaped humanity. It follows the march of progress into today’s world of computers and the Internet.\n\n[**Building in Singapore**](https://vimeo.com/458098734)**:** A gorgeous 5-minute video that shows how fast new buildings are rising in Singapore. Right now, the architecture of the future is centered there more than any other city in the world. While I’m certainly not a fan of everything Singapore does, Westerners should spend a lot more time studying them. A little envy for the quality of their infrastructure would be a good thing too.\n\n[**History of the Idea of Progress**](https://oll.libertyfund.org/pages/idea-of-progress-a-bibliographical-essay-by-robert-nisbet)**:** There are two predominant ways to think about time: linearly and cyclically. Today, we tend to think about it linearly, which wasn’t always the case. The linear conception of time has its roots in the Christian tradition where the world starts in the Garden of Eden at the beginning of the Old Testament and moves towards a New Heaven and a New Earth at the end of the New Testament. I wrote extensively about this idea in [my essay about Peter Thiel](https://perell.com/essay/peter-thiel). Most of the ideas were inspired by [this outstanding essay by Robert Nisbet](https://oll.libertyfund.org/pages/idea-of-progress-a-bibliographical-essay-by-robert-nisbet). You might also enjoy [this slide deck from Arthur Chandler.](http://www.arthurchandler.com/the-idea-of-progress)\n\n**The Scholar’s Stage:** This is an outstanding collection of essays, all from a single writer named Tanner Greer. The site focuses on history, strategy, and geopolitics. To date, my favorite essays are [_Tradition is Smarter Than You Are_](https://scholars-stage.blogspot.com/2018/08/tradition-is-smarter-than-you-are.html) and [_Taking Cross Cultural Psychology Seriously_](https://scholars-stage.blogspot.com/2018/12/on-taking-cross-cultural-psychology.html)*.* But Tanner is particularly a must-read if you’re interested in China. If so, I recommend [_The Chinese Strategic Tradition_](https://scholars-stage.blogspot.com/2015/05/the-chinese-strategic-tradition.html) and [_China’s Stalinist Heritage_](https://scholars-stage.blogspot.com/2019/01/reflections-on-chinas-stalinist.html)*.* If you’re looking for a rabbit hole to fall down, this is an excellent place to jump.\n\n[**How Aristotle Created the Computer**](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2017/03/aristotle-computer/518697/)**:** This essay traces the history of logic from Aristotle to modern computing. It builds upon the early days of Euclidean geometry, when mathematics was considered a hopelessly abstract subject with no practical use. Later, it moves into Claude Shannon’s work on information theory, which runs the computer you’re using to read this sentence. Here’s a good summary: “Logic began as a way to understand the laws of thought. It then helped create machines that could reason according to the rules of deductive logic. Today, deductive and inductive logic are being combined to create machines that both reason and learn.”\n\n**​**[**A History of American Families**](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2020/03/the-nuclear-family-was-a-mistake/605536/)**:** Future historians will look back at the second half of the 20th century as a time when the American family unit suffered. It was a time when mobility and opportunity surpassed family loyalty on the hierarchy of values. As the author writes: “We’ve made life freer for individuals and more unstable for families.” This essay is the best narrative I’ve seen about the nuclear family’s decline and what it means for American culture. Beyond a history, it explores tensions such as the stability of family vs. the dynamism of capitalism; close communities vs. the sociological constraints that make them possible.\n\n[**Birds and Frogs in Physics**](https://www.3quarksdaily.com/3quarksdaily/2020/11/birds-and-frogs-in-physics.html)**:** I’ve always liked the Fox vs. Hedgehog distinction between people who know a little bit about many things and people who know a lot about one thing. This essay makes a similar argument that people are either birds or frogs. Birds see things from, well… a bird’s eye view where they have a vast landscape in front of them without a lot of detail. On the other hand, frogs like to get dirty and dive into the nitty-gritty details. But this essay goes beyond that and tells a brief history of physics. Einstein and Feynman were birds, while Fermi and Hubble were frogs.\n\n**Richard Feynman:** A theoretical physicist known for his work in quantum electrodynamics and a Nobel Prize in 1965. A friend had a three-volume book with all his lectures. Walking by them regularly inspired me to watch his YouTube videos and read the transcripts ([freely transcribed on CalTech’s website](https://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/)). Beyond physics, Feynman achieved the impossible: he became a brilliant adult but never lost the playfulness of a child. To appreciate his fun, [start with this YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1ww1IXRfTA&t=2063s) about jiggling atoms, rubber bands, and intellectual puzzles.\n\n---\n\n## Other Recommendations\n\n**​**[**Kobe Bryant’s Last Game**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rx2inwUj_F0)**:** My YouTube recommendations led me to a video of Kobe’s final game when he went on such a tear that I swear a higher power was guiding his hand. The box score says he scored 60 points, but his achievement was more impressive than that. The Lakers were down by 10 points with ~3 minutes left in the game, before Kobe swooshed shot after shot to give his team the win. I particularly enjoyed the reaction shots of his wife, his daughters, and Jay-Z — all of whom seemed to sense a divine power hovering over the hardwood in front of them. Rest in peace, #24.\n\n**​**[**Movie of the Night**](https://www.movieofthenight.com/)**:** The simplest way to filter and categorize movies and TV series based on genre, year released, and the streaming service they run on.\n\n**​**[**Just Watch**](https://www.justwatch.com/)**:** Gone are the days where it feels like “everything’s on Netflix.” Video is now scattered across streaming platforms, and I’ve spent way too long looking for a simple video in the past. The fix is here though. If you ever want to watch something but don’t know where you can, this app will guide you to the best place.\n\n**JFK’s Fitness Plan for America:** In the 1960s, President John F. Kennedy laid out a vision to get America in shape. He worried that young Americans had become fat, weak, and un-athletic after World War II, and he even published an article in *Sports Illustrated* called [“The Soft American.”](http://www.recreatingwithkids.com/news/read-it-here-kennedys-the-soft-american/) His words echoes the ancient Greek idea that sound minds are born from sound bodies. I recommend [this 3-minute statement](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0WmpszjnN8) he gave in 1962 and the [trailer of a documentary called *The Motivation Factor*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fISgKl8dB3M)*,* which builds upon Kennedy’s original vision.\n\n**​**[**Augusta National**](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/06/24/inside-the-cultish-dreamworld-of-augusta-national)**:** I love the word *Valhalla.* In Norse mythology, it describes a majestic place where people live blissfully under the hand of God. Augusta National, the world’s top golf course and the host of the Masters Tournament, is the closest thing I’ve seen to that definition. It’s so immaculate that it almost feels mythical. This article describes all the ends (sometimes dark) that the club goes through to give the course a surreal glow.\n\n**Troy:** This was one of my favorite movies as a kid, and I rewatched it for the first time in more than a decade last weekend. It recounts the story of *The Iliad,* and though the details aren’t exact, it captures the spirit of the Greek epic. If you prefer an audiobook to the movie, I recommend [this short retelling of the story.](https://amzn.to/3DmcFEz)\n\n**​**[**Arnold Schwarzenegger’s Approach to Bodybuilding**](https://twitter.com/GraduatedBen/status/1403898752054837249?s=20)**:** I grew up in California with Arnold as my governor, but I somehow never appreciated him. First, he became a world bodybuilding champion. Then, he said, “I’m going to become one of the most famous actors in the world.” Then, he became the governor of California. Insane. For a window into his work ethic and all the fun he had doing it, I got a good laugh out of [these two pages](https://twitter.com/GraduatedBen/status/1403898752054837249?s=20) from one of his [biographies](https://amzn.to/3jh8GSS).\n\n**​**[**Comparing Weather**](https://weatherspark.com/)**:** I would’ve never expected to have this much fun playing with a weather tool, but here we are. You can see how the climate of any city changes throughout the year. Most maps will show you temperature, but everybody knows that’s only part of the story. This tool will also show you sunlight, humidity, cloud cover, and a tourism score which will tell you the best time to visit.\n\n**Matthew McConaughey:** Let’s start with an airport bookstore recommendation. As you know, the purpose of Friday Finds is to escape the intellectual spotlight as much as possible. If it’s in the news, I cut it. But this week we have a glitch in the system. Mr. McConaughey’s memoir, [_Greenlights_](https://amzn.to/398Rp8X), is so good that it gets to hang at the top today. Unlike other celebrity books, he actually wrote it. The storytelling is top-notch, and if you’re looking to laugh so hard that tears fall from your eyes, pick up the audiobook.\n\n[**Fellow Kettles**](https://fellowproducts.com/products/staggekg?variant=31212438224996)**:** Now that I’ve been moving apartments, I’m in the market for well-designed home appliances. Most of mine work “fine.” But there’s one that puts a smile on my face every time I use it: [the Fellow Stagg EKG Electric Pour-Over Kettle](https://fellowproducts.com/products/staggekg?variant=18635551080563). It lets you control the temperature of your drink, down to the degree. If you make pour-over coffee, it has a host of other features like a stopwatch and a PID controller to help you hold the perfect temperature over time.\n\n[**Getaway**](https://getaway.house/)**:** A startup called Getaway has cabins around the country that offer easy trips away from major cities. They’re 1-2 bedrooms, and they’re all in nature. It’s basically a hyper-specific Airbnb, but geared towards short escapes to the woods. I haven’t tried it yet, but am going to book a cabin for the spring.\n\n[**Obscure PDFs**](https://www.reddit.com/r/obscurePDFs/): This is a Reddit collection of PDFs you won’t find anywhere else. On the page, you’ll find in-depth looks into restaurant business models, the 100-year history of erotic art, the psychology of fascism, how the quantum search algorithm works, and the CIA’s simple sabotage field manual.\n\n[**Barstool’s Pizza Reviews**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnLIPjYS__o)**:** You weren’t expecting this link, were you? Every day, [Barstool Sports](https://www.barstoolsports.com/) founder Dave Portnoy reviews a different pizza shop. Even if the brand looks casual, Barstool’s [_Pardon My Take_](https://podcastone.com/pardon-my-take) *is the* biggest sports-related podcast in the world. In this pizza review, Dave is with a few celebrities in Midtown Manhattan. Halfway through, a girl walking next to him recognizes Dave (the Internet celebrity), without acknowledging the traditional Hollywood ones (Jon Hamm, Ed Helms, Jeremy Renner, Jake Johnson, and Hannibal Buress). Videos like this highlight the under-estimated inertia behind Internet culture.\n\n[**Criterion Collection**](https://www.criterionchannel.com/browse)**:** My writing coach [Ellen Fishbein](http://ellenrhymes.com/) is a movie fanatic, and says this platform is the best place to find and watch movies. The service is dedicated to promoting exceptional classic and contemporary films. Each film is presented in the way the directors would have wanted them to be seen. I can’t believe I didn’t know about this.\n\n[**Media Mail**](https://about.usps.com/notices/not121/not121_tech.htm): If you’re an American and you ever need to send educational materials, use Media Mail. It’s a government-subsidized service from the United States Postal Service designed for media like books, movies, CDs, articles, and magazines. Best of all, there’s no catch. Using media mail is as simple as shipping a regular package.\n\n[**Google Books Ngram Viewer:**](https://books.google.com/ngrams) This tool tracks the frequency of any set of word strings found in sources printed between 1950 and 2019. With its online search engine, you can see how words and phrases have risen and fallen in popularity throughout history. At the very least, it’s a blast to play with. And at most, it’s a window into mass psychology over the centuries.\n\n_As you can see, these are the kinds of links you won’t find anywhere else on the Internet.

After 20 years of not being able to refer to the decade we’re in, we’re all finally free—in the clear for the next 80 years until 2100, at which point I assume [AGI](https://waitbutwhy.com/2015/01/artificial-intelligence-revolution-1.html) will have figured out what to call the two decades between 2100 and 2120.\n\nWe now live in the 20s! It’s exciting. “The twenties” is super legit-sounding, and it’s so old school. The 40s are old. The 30s even more so. But nothing is older school than the Roaring 20s.\n\nWe’re now in charge of making this a cool decade so when people 100 years from now are thinking about how incredibly old-timey the 2020s were, it’s old-timey in a cool appealing way and not a boring shitty way.\n\nIt’s also weird that to us, the 2020s sounds like such a rad futuristic decade—and that’s how the 1920s seemed to people 100 years ago today. They were all used to the 19-teens, and suddenly they were like, “whoa cool we’re in the _twenties!”_ Then they got upset thinking about how much farther along in life their 1910 self thought they’d be by 1920.\n\nIn any case, it’s a perfect time for one of those “shit we’re old” posts.\n\nSo here are some New Years 2020 time facts:\n\nWhen World War 2 started, the Civil War felt as far away to Americans as WW2 feels to us now.\n\n[![](/assets/1-1.png)](https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/1-1.png)\n\nSpeaking of World War 2, the world wars were pretty close together. If World War 2 were starting today, World War 1 would feel about as far back to us as 9/11.\n\n[![](/assets/7.png)](https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/7.png)\n\nThe Soviet Union break up is now as distant a memory as JFK’s assassination was when the Soviet Union broke up.\n\n[![](/assets/3-1.png)](https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/3-1.png)\n\nMoving on to more inane topics, there have been more Super Bowls since the 1993 Cowboys–Bills SB than before it.\n\n[![](/assets/2.png)](https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2.png)\n\nAnd West Germany’s 1974 World Cup victory happened closer to the first World Cup in 1930 than to today.\n\n_The Wonder Years_ aired from 1988 and 1993 and depicted the years between 1968 and 1973. When I watched the show, it felt like it was set in a time long ago. If a new Wonder Years premiered today, it would cover the years between 2000 and 2005.\n\n[![](/assets/6-1.png)](https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/6-1.png)\n\nAlso, remember when _Jurassic Park_, _The Lion King_, and _Forrest Gump_ came out in theaters? Closer to the moon landing than today.\n\n[![](/assets/8.png)](https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/8.png)\n\nY2K? Closer to the 70s than today.\n\n[![](/assets/9-1.png)](https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/9-1.png)\n\nMeanwhile, the O.J. Simpson trial is now half way between the 1960s and today. And closer to the Charles Manson trial.\n\n[![](/assets/10-2.png)](https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/10-2.png)\n\nAs for you, if you’re 60 or older, you were born closer to the 1800s than today.\n\n[![](/assets/4-1.png)](https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/4-1.png)\n\nToday’s 35-year-olds were born closer to the 1940s than to today.\n\n[![](/assets/5-1.png)](https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/5-1.png)\n\nThere are a lot of options for that kind of calculation, but those two seemed like the most depressing to me. Worth mentioning that my 94-year-old grandmother was born closer to the Andrew Jackson administration than to today.\n\nIf you were born in the 1980s like me, a kid today who’s the age you were in 1990 is a full 30-year generation younger than you. They’ll remember Obama’s presidency the way you remember Reagan’s. 9/11 to them is the moon landing for you. The 90s seem as ancient to them as the 60s seem to you. To you, the 70s are just a little before your time—that’s how they think of the 2000s. They see the 70s how you see the 40s. And the hippy 60s seems as old to them as the Great Depression seems to you.\n\nBut the weirdest thing about kids today: most of them will live to see the 2100s.\n\nSorry if this stressed you out.

The tool can generate standalone webpages or be embedded in existing pages. Choose from built-in themes or provide custom CSS.\n\n![/static/images/fugazi.gif](https://idyll-lang.org/static/images/fugazi.gif)\n\nWe offer a [free public hosting service](https://idyll.pub/) so that you can publish your creations to the web in a matter of seconds. Continue reading to learn more about the project, or see our [example gallery](https://idyll-lang.org/gallery).\n\nIdyll starts with the same principles as markdown, and uses a lot of the same syntax. If you want text to appear in your output, just start writing. The real power of Idyll comes when you want to use JavaScript to enrich your writing. Special syntax allows you to embed JavaScript inline with your text. Idyll comes with a variety of components that can be used out-of-the-box to create rich documents.\n\nTo include a JavaScript component, you can add tags to your text like this:\n\n```\nLorem ipsum...\n\n[ComponentName property:variableValue onEvent:`variableValue = 5` /]\n\nLorem ipsum...\n```\n\nEach tag corresponds to a React component, which receives the provided properties. Properties can be reactive variables or expressions, Idyll handles the logic to watch for variable updates and re-render components as needed. Idyll is compatible with graphics libraries like D3 and P5 and can support most JavaScript libraries that are available on npm.\n\n## Example Usage\n\nIdyll includes a number of useful components by default, for example here is a chart component, plotting a sine wave.\n\n1.02.03.04.05.06.0\\-1.0\\-0.50.51.0\n\n```\n[Chart\n  equation:` (t) => Math.sin(t)`\n  domain:`[0, 2 * Math.PI]`\n  samplePoints:1000 /]\n```\n\nCurrently it’s static, but variables can be used to parameterize the output, allowing the chart to dynamically update. For example, we can give it a variable domain, and a variable function to plot.\n\n```\n[var name:\"func\" value:`Math.sin` /]\n[var name:\"domainStart\" value:0 /]\n[var name:\"domainEnd\" value:`2 * Math.PI` /]\n\n[Chart\n  equation:` (t) => func(t)`\n  domain:`[domainStart, domainEnd]`\n  samplePoints:1000 /]\n```\n\nThese variables can be updated based on user actions, for example they can be attached to a button click:\n\n1.02.03.04.05.06.0\\-1.0\\-0.50.51.0\n\n```\n\n[Chart ... /]\n\n[Button onClick:`func = Math.sin`]sin[/Button]\n[Button onClick:`func = Math.cos`]cos[/Button]\n```\n\nor bound to the value of standard input widgets:\n\n1.02.03.04.05.06.0\\-1.0\\-0.50.51.0\n\n#### Update Domain\n\nStart:\n\nEnd:\n\n```\n[Chart ... /]\n\n#### Update Domain\n\nStart: [Range value:domainStart min:`-4 * Math.PI` max:0 step:0.01  /]\nEnd: [Range value:domainEnd min:0 max:`4 * Math.PI` step:0.01  /]\n```\n\nWrite your own equation:\n\n1.02.03.04.05.06.0\\-3.0\\-2.0\\-1.01.02.03.0\n\n#### Update Domain\n\nStart:\n\nEnd:\n\n```\n\n[var name:\"funcString\" value:`\"(x) => x * Math.sin(10 / (x || 1))\"` /]\n[derived name:\"funcFromString\" value:`eval(funcString)` /]\n\n[TextInput value:funcString /]\n\n[Chart\n  equation:` (t) =>  funcFromString(t) `\n  domain:`[domainStart, domainEnd]`\n  range:`[-3, 3]`\n  samplePoints:1000 /]\n```\n\n## Support\n\nIf you like what Idyll is doing, consider [buying a sticker](https://opencollective.com/idyll) to help sustain the project, or select from one of the other one-time and recurring donation options on Open Collective.\n\n[![](https://opencollective.com/idyll/donate/button@2x.png?color=blue)](https://opencollective.com/idyll/)\n\nIdyll is supported by the Interactive Data Lab at the University of Washington, and by O’Reilly Media, Rhizome and The Eutopia Foundation.![sponsors](inbox/assets/sponsors..png)\n","n":0.047}}},{"i":558,"$":{"0":{"v":"HTTP Error 403","n":0.577},"1":{"v":"\n# [HTTP Error 403](http://blog.ssokolow.com/archives/2019/11/07/how-to-skip-the-fortune-command-when-your-shell-is-slow-to-start/)\n\nWe're sorry, but we could not fulfill your request for /archives/2019/11/07/how-to-skip-the-fortune-command-when-your-shell-is-slow-to-start/ on this server.\n\nAn invalid request was received from your browser.

Learning allows us to create new “maps”—and edit old ones—in order to navigate the dynamic, highly-complex world with confidence.\n\nGrowth is fundamentally driven by the long-term accumulation and compounding of usable learning. We accumulate and compound this learning through consumption and retention. Consumption is the inputs—what comes in. Retention is what remains after any leakage.\n\nImagine your brain like a bathtub.\n\nThe faucet is the entrance, the drain is the exit. Everything you research and consume flows in through the faucet. Everything you forget flows out through the drain.\n\nI’ve written a lot about the faucet in the past—[here](https://sahilbloom.substack.com/p/the-feynman-technique-how-to-learn) and [here](https://sahilbloom.substack.com/p/the-new-way-to-learn) most recently—but I’ve never talked about the drain.\n\nLet’s fix that today—let’s talk about learning retention.\n\n## Learning from The Matrix\n\n[![](/assets/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F99b5d7d9-d46d-45ab-b359-8d10cee9f2b7_1200x649.jpeg)](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F99b5d7d9-d46d-45ab-b359-8d10cee9f2b7_1200x649.jpeg)\n\nI love The Matrix. It’s not just sci-fi, there is a lot we can draw from it about learning and retention.\n\nBear with me…\n\nIn one of the early scenes of the first film, Keanu Reeves’ character—Neo—is plugged into the system and has a program uploaded into his brain. He has a moment of shocked revelation where he looks up and says, “I know kung fu.” He proceeds to demonstrate his new mastery in a virtual sparring room. Most importantly, Neo never forgets this new skill.\n\n[![](/assets/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F40130a6b-25ef-4da5-90c7-a92dbaf33fd1_1200x675.jpeg)](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F40130a6b-25ef-4da5-90c7-a92dbaf33fd1_1200x675.jpeg)\n\nTo be sure, this isn’t _that crazy_ an idea. Our brains are just software. When we learn, we are updating that software. But in the real world, though, our software is flawed and buggy—we forget important things or overwrite old data all the time.\n\nOur best bet? Develop a strategy for retention that is grounded in science. An approach to retention that is as integrated and comprehensive as our approach to learning. We may not become Neo, but we can become more Neo-like.\n\n## The Retention Framework\n\nHere's a tactical framework for improving your retention…\n\nThe retention framework I use involves five steps:\n\n1.  Inspired Consumption\n2.  Unstructured Note-Taking\n3.  Consolidation\n4.  Analogize\n5.  Idea Exercise\n\nThe structure is sequential, but its practice is often dynamic & iterative.\n\nLet's walk through each of the steps...\n\n### Step 1: Inspired Consumption\n\nRetention starts with consumption.\n\nI bucket consumption into two types:\n\n- Forced: Compelled, either internally or externally.\n- Inspired: Driven entirely by your internal inspirations.\n\nIf you've ever been in school, you know what forced consumption looks like. Forced consumption is the book you're told to read, despite the topic being of zero interest to you. It's the foundation of much of the traditional education system—yet another reason why so many of us are bad at learning retention!\n\nInspired consumption is when you feel genuinely pulled to consume—when you enjoy the consumption process.\n\nIt requires the willingness to put ego aside and \"quit” more books (or content) when that genuine inspiration fades.\n\nInspired consumption is important for retention for two key reasons.\n\n1.  Inspiration is a precursor to flow. More flow state, more retention.\n2.  Inspiration fuels engagement. Engage with the content, retain the content.\n\nInspired consumption is the foundation of retention.\n\n### Step 2: Unstructured Note-Taking\n\nWhen you start consuming, you should have a note-taking system in front of you.\n\n> _Sahil Note: I use Notion for my note taking, but there are probably 10 other options out there (and I’m currently evaluating Obsidian as another option for more networked notes). The old fashioned way—pen and paper—works too, with the caveat that searchable notes are ideal in my opinion._\n\nOn the first pass through the material, keep your notes as unstructured and free-flowing as possible.\n\nWhat to take note of:\n\n- Foundation-building ideas\n- Novel insights\n- Things that made you go “hmmm” or “wow!”\n- Connections you identified to other topics\n- Questions or confusion\n- Strong reactions you had to new information\n\nRemember: This first pass of notes is intended to be unstructured. The simple act of writing helps ideas stick.\n\n### Step 3: Consolidation\n\nZoom out and review your unstructured notes.\n\nWhat are the most interesting, novel insights or ideas? What are the most confusing?\n\nConsolidation is where you re-consume content with a specific focus on building structure around your notes in these particular areas.\n\nIf unstructured note-taking created a bunch of dots, consolidation is where you start connecting them.\n\nIt doesn't have to be perfect, but you should start to form a more refined picture as you re-consume the content for this purpose.\n\nConsolidation is when knowledge begins to stick.\n\n### Step 4: Analogize\n\nAnalogizing is the most effective—and least well-known—retention tool.\n\nThis is where you take your newly-learned information and place it within your broader mental maps. You make clear comparisons and connections between newly-learned and existing information.\n\nHere's a real example from my writing to illustrate how this works:\n\nI did a bunch of research on Morris Chang and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company for a piece. During my consolidation, it struck me that TSMC's novel pure-play chip manufacturer model had enabled independent chip designers to start their own companies.\n\nAs I started the process of analogizing, I searched for a connection point—something to tie this newly-learned information to some existing information in my brain.\n\nThen, it hit me: this looked very similar to what Shopify had done in creating infrastructure that enabled independent players to sell online.\n\nI had created context for the new learning within my broader mental map—it would stick.\n\n> _Sahil Note: Incidentally, this came full circle ~1 year later, when I interviewed Harley Finklestein—the President of Shopify—for an upcoming episode of Where It Happens. I was able to talk about this connection with him and get his perspectives on the analogy. Damn, I love my job…_\n\n[![](/assets/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F653aa5c8-cde8-4fa9-b01c-0970552e7d23_1280x720.jpeg)](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F653aa5c8-cde8-4fa9-b01c-0970552e7d23_1280x720.jpeg)\n\n### Step 5: Idea Exercise\n\nThink of the new idea as a muscle—if left on its own, it will atrophy. You have to exercise it—early and often.\n\nHow?\n\nHere are a few ideas:\n\n- Bring it up in conversations\n- Talk about it with a friend\n- Try to teach it to someone\n- Spaced Repetition\n\nIf you exercise the idea, it will stick and grow.\n\nSpaced Repetition is the most formal—and powerful—idea exercise method, so let’s do a deeper dive into it.\n\n#### Spaced Repetition - The History & Science\n\nSpaced Repetition is a scientifically-proven method for enhanced retention. It’s a method in which information is consumed at increasing intervals until it's committed to long-term memory. It leverages cognitive science—the way our brains work to convert short-term to long-term memory—to help you retain newly-consumed information.\n\nThe science behind it is fascinating.\n\nHermann Ebbinghaus—a German psychologist—was the first to identify its effect on retention. In 1885, he published _Memory: A Contribution to Experimental Psychology_, which became a groundbreaking work for the field.\n\n[![](/assets/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1dedf08b-73dd-4317-991c-a933fc1199ce_600x336.jpeg)](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1dedf08b-73dd-4317-991c-a933fc1199ce_600x336.jpeg)\n\nIn this work, Ebbinghaus discussed his most famous finding: the Ebbinghaus Forgetting Curve (“EFC” for short).\n\nThe EFC maps the exponential loss of newly-learned information—it's sharp in the first 20 minutes, significant through an hour, and then levels off after a day.\n\n[![](/assets/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcfe0fe70-198c-4a6f-ab6c-61d482e35b96_1280x670.png)](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcfe0fe70-198c-4a6f-ab6c-61d482e35b96_1280x670.png)\n\nEbbinghaus observed that each time the newly-learned information was reviewed, the EFC was essentially \"reset\" at the starting point, but with a slower decay curve.\n\nThis is important!\n\nSpaced Repetitions had the effect of flattening the memory retention decay curve.\n\n[![](/assets/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5f876af6-8dfa-42f5-bba1-f16381347977_834x532.jpeg)](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5f876af6-8dfa-42f5-bba1-f16381347977_834x532.jpeg)\n\nUnderstanding the science is helpful, but you need to put Spaced Repetition into action to adapt its use case for your purposes.\n\n#### Spaced Repetition - Putting It Into Action\n\nHere's how it works:\n\nLet's say you're trying to learn some facts about Apple—its history, business segments, financial performance, etc.\n\nIf this was for a college exam, you'd probably do this the \"old fashioned way”—down some espresso, cram it into your mind, and hope you remember it for the test the next day. But you're not in college anymore—you want this learning for life, not for some one-off exam. You want this to stick.\n\nSo instead of the old way, you go with the new way—Spaced Repetition.\n\nYou first consume the new information at 8am. Then you start “repetitions” where you recite back learnings and fill gaps:\n\n- Repetition 1: 9am (1 hr later)\n- Repetition 2: 12pm (3 hrs later)\n- Repetition 3: 6pm (6 hrs later)\n- Repetition 4: 6am (12 hrs later)\n- and so on at increasing intervals...\n\nWhy does this work?\n\nIn simple terms, you can think of your brain as a muscle—each repetition is a \"flex\" of that muscle. By steadily increasing the intervals, you are pushing the muscle with steadily more challenging loads. You're forcing the retention muscle to grow.\n\nAs for where this fits into the process, I plug it directly into my retention framework as part of \"idea exercise”—I think this is where it fits in most effectively.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIt’s not enough to simply learn more—you have to retain more of what you learn.\n\nSo to recap, my framework for better retention:\n\n1.  Inspired Consumption: Inspired consumption is when you feel genuinely pulled to consume—when you enjoy the consumption process. Put ego aside and \"quit” more books (or content) when that genuine inspiration fades.\n2.  Unstructured Note-Taking: Take unstructured notes of novel insights, key ideas, or things that caused a reaction.\n3.  Consolidation: Zoom out and consolidate your unstructured notes across key themes, insights, or ideas.\n4.  Analogize: Take your newly-learned information and place it within your broader mental maps. Make clear comparisons and connections between newly-learned and existing information.\n5.  Idea Exercise: Use Spaced Repetition and other methods to exercise your new learnings and prevent atrophy.\n\nGive this framework a shot and let me know how it works for you!\n\n## Where It Happens Podcast\n\n[![](/assets/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F32a09ba6-930f-4297-88a1-a24555df98f6_1280x720.png)](https://whereithappens.trwih.com/)\n\n**How to Build Hype with Matteo Franceschetti**\n\nWatch it on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpunjYZ3HbA&t=1212s) and listen to it on [Apple Podcasts](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/how-to-build-hype-with-matteo-franceschetti/id1593424985?i=1000549883356) or [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6wZDP3G7I62FbE0YWMa8ah?si=1b6ad393fd224f37).

Quick note before we jump in:\n\nThis is a post about something I’ve been wanting to write about forever: careers. Society tells us a lot of things about what we should want in a career and what the possibilities are—which is weird because I’m pretty sure society knows very little about any of this. When it comes to careers, society is like your great uncle who traps you at holidays and goes on a 15-minute mostly incoherent unsolicited advice monologue, and you tune out almost the whole time because it’s super clear he has very little idea what he’s talking about and that everything he says is like 45 years outdated. Society is like that great uncle, and conventional wisdom is like his rant. Except in this case, instead of tuning it out, we pay rapt attention to every word, and then we make major career decisions based on what he says. Kind of a weird thing for us to do.\n\nThis post isn’t me giving you career advice really—it’s a framework that I think can help you make career decisions that actually reflect who you are, what you want, and what our rapidly changing career landscape looks like today. You’re not a pro at this, but you’re certainly more qualified to figure out what’s best for you than our collective un-self-aware great uncle. For those of you yet to start your career who aren’t sure what you want to do with their lives, or those of you currently in the middle of your career who aren’t sure you’re on the right path, I hope this post can help you press the reset button on your thought process and get some clarity.\n\nFinally, it feels very good to put this post up. It’s been way, way too long. The last year has been pretty frustrating for me and anyone who likes Wait But Why—a lot of build-up of ideas with none of the satisfying release of those ideas on the blog (most of my last year has been spent working on another, way longer post). I’m hoping this WBW Dark Ages era is nearing its end, because I miss hanging out here. Thanks, as always, to the small group of ridiculously generous, ridiculously patient patrons who have stuck with us through such a slow period.\n\n– Tim\n\n**\\*PDF:** If you want to print this post or read it offline, the PDF is probably the way to go.

We just woke up out of nowhere and found ourselves on some path set for us by our parents, by society, and by circumstances. We’re told the rules of the river and the way we should swim and what our goals should be. Our job isn’t to think about our path—it’s to succeed on the path we’ve been placed on, based on the way success has been defined for us.\n\nFor many of us—and I suspect for a large portion of Wait But Why readers—our childhood river then feeds into a pond, called college.[1](https://waitbutwhy.com/#footnote-1-6721) We may have some say in which particular pond we landed in, but in the end, most college ponds aren’t really that different from one another.\n\n[![](/assets/pond-1.png)](https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/pond-1.png)\n\nIn the pond, we have a bit more breathing room and some leeway to branch out into more specific interests. We start to ponder, looking out at the pond’s shores—out there where the real world starts and where we’ll be spending the rest of our lives. This usually brings some mixed feelings.\n\n[![](/assets/Looking-at-shore-2.png)](https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Looking-at-shore-2.png)\n\nAnd then, 22 years after waking up in a rushing river, we’re kicked out of the pond and told by the world to go make something of our lives.\n\n[![](/assets/shore-1.jpg.jpeg)](https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/shore-1.jpg)\n\nThere are a few problems here. One is that at that moment, you’re kind of skill-less and knowledge-less and a lot of other things-less:\n\n[![](/assets/shore-2.jpg.jpeg)](https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/shore-2.jpg)\n\nBut before you can even address your general uselessness, there’s an even bigger issue—your pre-set path ended. Kids in school are kind of like employees of a company where someone else is the CEO. But no one is the CEO of your life in the real world, or of your career path—except you. And you’ve spent your whole life becoming a pro student, leaving you with zero experience as the CEO of anything. Up to now, you’ve only been in charge of the micro decisions—”How do I succeed at my job as a student?”—and now you’re suddenly holding the keys to the macro cockpit as well, tasked with answering stressful macro questions like “Who am I?” and “What are the important things in life?” and “What are my options for paths and which one should I choose and how do I even make a path?” When we leave school for the last time, the macro guidance we’ve become so accustomed to is suddenly whisked away from us, leaving us standing there holding our respective dicks, with no idea how to do this.\n\nThen time happens. And we end up on a path. And that path becomes our life’s story.\n\nAt the end of our life, when we look back at how things went, we can see our life’s path in its entirety, from an aerial view.\n\nWhen scientists study people on their deathbed and how they feel about their lives, they usually find that many of them feel some serious regrets. I think a lot of those regrets stem from the fact that most of us aren’t really taught about path-making in our childhoods, and most of us also don’t get much better at path-making as adults, which leaves many people looking back on a life path that didn’t really make sense, given who they are and the world they lived in.\n\nSo this is a post about path-making. Let’s take a 30-minute pre-deathbed pause to look down at the path we’re on, and ahead at where that path seems to be going, and make sure it makes sense.\n\n**The Cook and the Chef—Revisited**\n\nIn the past, [I’ve written about](https://waitbutwhy.com/2015/11/the-cook-and-the-chef-musks-secret-sauce.html) the critical distinction between “reasoning from first principles” and “reasoning by analogy”—or what I called being a “chef” vs. being a “cook.” Since writing the post, I notice this distinction everywhere, and I’ve thought about it roughly 2 million times in my own life.\n\nThe idea is that reasoning from first principles is reasoning like a scientist. You take core facts and observations and use them to puzzle together a conclusion, kind of like a chef playing around with raw ingredients to try to make them into something good. By doing this puzzling, a chef eventually writes a new recipe. The other kind of reasoning—reasoning by analogy—happens when you look at the way things are already done and you essentially copy it, with maybe a little personal tweak here and there—kind of like a cook following an already written recipe.\n\nA pure verbatim recipe-copying cook and a pure independently inventive chef are the two extreme ends of what is, of course, a spectrum. But for any particular part of your life that involves reasoning and decision making, wherever you happen to be on the spectrum, your reasoning process can usually be boiled down to fundamentally chef-like or fundamentally cook-like. Creating vs. copying. Originality vs. conformity.\n\nBeing a chef takes a tremendous amount of time and energy—which makes sense, because you’re not trying to reinvent the wheel, you’re trying to invent it for the first time. Puzzling your way to a conclusion feels like navigating a mysterious forest while blindfolded and always involves a whole lot of failure, in the form of trial and error. Being a cook is far easier and more straightforward and less icky. In most situations, being a chef is a terrible waste of time, and comes with a high opportunity cost, since time on Earth is immensely scarce. Right now, I’m wearing J. Crew jeans and a plain t-shirt and a hoodie and Allbirds shoes, because I’m trying to conform. Throughout my life, I’ve looked around at people who seem kind of like me and I’ve bought a bunch of clothes that look like what they wear. And this makes sense—because clothes aren’t important to me, and they’re not how I choose to express my individuality. So in my case, fashion is a perfect part of life to use a reasoning shortcut and be a cook.[2](https://waitbutwhy.com/#footnote-2-6721)\n\nBut then there are those parts of life that are really really deeply important—like where you choose to live, or the kinds of friends you choose to make, or whether you want to get married and to whom, or whether you want to have kids and how you want to raise them, or how you set your lifestyle priorities.\n\nCareer-path-carving is definitely one of those really really deeply important things. Let’s spell out the obvious reasons why:\n\n**Time.** For most of us, a career (including ancillary career time, like time spent commuting and thinking about your work) will eat up somewhere between 50,000 and 150,000 hours. At the moment, a long human life runs at about 750,000 hours. When you subtract childhood (~175,000 hours) and the portion of your adult life you’ll spend sleeping, eating, exercising, and otherwise taking care of the human pet you live in, along with errands and general life upkeep (~325,000 hours), you’re left with 250,000 “meaningful adult hours.”[3](https://waitbutwhy.com/#footnote-3-6721) So a typical career will take up somewhere between 20% and 60% of your meaningful adult time—not something to be a cook about.\n\n[![](/assets/Pie-Chart.png)](https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Pie-Chart.png)\n\n**Quality of Life.** Your career has a major effect on all the non-career hours as well. For those of us not already wealthy through past earnings, marriage, or inheritance, a career doubles as our means of support. The particulars of your career also often play a big role in determining where you live, how flexible your life is, the kinds of things you’re able to do in your free time, and sometimes even in who you end up marrying.\n\n**Impact.** On top of your career being the way you spend much of your time and the means of support for the rest of your time, your career triples as your primary mode of impact-making. Every human life touches thousands of other lives in thousands of different ways, and all of those lives you alter then go on to touch thousands of lives of their own. We can’t test this, but I’m pretty sure that you can select any 80-year-old alive today, go back in time 80 years, find them as an infant, throw the infant in the trash, and then come back to the present day and find a countless number of things changed. All lives make a large impact on the world and on the future—but the _kind_ of impact you end up making is largely within your control, depending on the values you live by and the places you direct your energy. Whatever shape your career path ends up taking, the world will be altered by it.\n\n**Identity.** In our childhoods, people ask us about our career plans by asking us what we want to _be_ when we grow up. When we grow up, we tell people about our careers by telling them what we _are._ We don’t say, “I practice law”—we say, “I am a lawyer.” This is probably an unhealthy way to think about careers, but the way many societies are right now, a person’s career quadruples as the person’s primary identity. Which is kind of a big thing.\n\nSo yeah—your career path isn’t like my shitty sweatshirt. It’s really really deeply important, putting it squarely in “Definitely absolutely make sure to be a chef about it” territory.\n\n**Your Career Map**\n\nWhich brings us to you. I don’t know exactly what your deal is. But there’s a good chance you’re somewhere in one of the blue regions—\n\n[![](/assets/Life-path.png)](https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Life-path.png)\n\n—which means your career path is a work in progress.[4](https://waitbutwhy.com/#footnote-4-6721)\n\nWhether you’re yet to start your career or well into it, somewhere in the back of your mind (or maybe in the very front of it) is a “Career Plans” map.\n\nWe can group map holders into three broad categories—each of which is well-represented in the river, in the pond, standing on the shore, and at every stage of adult life.\n\nOne group of people will look at the map and see a big, stressful question mark.\n\n[![](/assets/map1.png)](https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/map1.png)\n\nThese are people who feel indecisive about their career path. They’ve been told to follow their passion, but they don’t feel especially passionate about anything. They’ve been told to let their strengths guide them, but they’re not sure what they’re best at. They may have felt they had answers in the past, but they’ve changed and they’re no longer sure who they are or where they’re going.\n\nOther people will see a nice clear arrow representing a direction they feel confident is right—but find their legs walking in a different direction. They’re living with one of the most common sources of human misery, a career path they know in their heart is wrong.\n\n[![](/assets/map2.png)](https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/map2.png)\n\nThe lucky ones feel they know where they want to go and believe they’re marching in that direction.\n\n[![](/assets/map3.png)](https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/map3.png)\n\nBut even these people should pause and ask themselves, “Who actually drew this arrow? Was it really me?” The answer can get confusing.\n\nI’m pretty sure all of these people would benefit from a moment of career path reflection.\n\n**The Okay But Why Do You Think You Can Help Me With My Career Reflection You Draw Stick Figures for a Living Blue Box**\n\nExtremely fair question. One thing I always ask myself as I pick topics to write about is, “Am I qualified to write about this?” Here are the reasons I decided to take on this topic:\n\n1. I have spent most of the last 20 years in a perpetual state of analyzing my own career path.\n\n2. My path has taken a lot of turns—from wanting to be a movie star when I was 7 to wanting to be the president when I was 17 to wanting to write film scores when I was 22 to wanting to be an entrepreneur when I was 24 to wanting to write musicals when I was 29 to most recently wanting to be a writer-ish guy.\n\n3. After being pretty all over the place about my career path for most of my life, I actually love my job now. That’s always subject to change, but being able to look at the decision-making processes that led me to confusing or frustrating places, side by side with the decisions that led me to a more fulfilling place, has offered me some wisdom on where people tend to go wrong.\n\n4. On top of having my own story to look at, I’ve had a front-row seat for the stories of my dozen or so closest friends. My friends seem to share my career path obsessiveness, so between observing their paths and talking with them about those paths again and again along the way, I’ve broadened my views on the topic, which helps me to distinguish between the lessons that are my-life specific and those that are more universal.\n\n5. Finally, this isn’t a post about which careers are better or worse than others or which career values are more or less meaningful—there are lots of social scientists and self-help authors out there with good data on that, and I’m not one of them. It’s instead a framework that I think can help a career-path reflector better see their own situation, and what really matters to them, clearly and honestly. This framework has worked really well for me, so I think it can probably be helpful for other people too.\n\nNow that you’ve taken a fresh look at your Career Plans map, along with whatever arrow may or may not be on it, put it down and out of sight. We’ll come back to it at the end of the post. It’s time now for a deep dive—let’s think about this from scratch. From first principles.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nIn the [cook-chef post](https://waitbutwhy.com/2015/11/the-cook-and-the-chef-musks-secret-sauce.html), I designed a simple framework for how a chef makes major career choices. At its core is a simple Venn diagram.\n\nThe first part of the diagram is the Want Box, which contains all the careers you find desirable.\n\n[![](/assets/Want-Box.png)](https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Want-Box.png)\n\nThe second part of the diagram is the Reality Box. The Reality Box is for the set of all careers that are realistic to potentially achieve—based on a comparison, in each case, between your level of potential in an area and the general difficulty of achieving success in that area.\n\n[![](/assets/Reality-Box.png)](https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Reality-Box.png)\n\nThe overlapping area contains your optimal career path choices—the set of arrows you should consider drawing on your Career Map. We can call it the Option Pool.\n\n[![](/assets/venn.png)](https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/venn.png)\n\nThis is straightforward enough. But actually filling in these boxes accurately is way harder than it looks. For the diagram to work, it has to be as close to the truth as possible, and to get there, we have to lift up the hood of our subconscious and head down. Let’s start with the Want Box.\n\n**Deep Analysis, Part 1: Your Want Box**\n\nThe hard thing about the Want Box is that you want a bunch of different things—or, rather, there are a bunch of different sides of you, and each of them wants—and fears—its own stuff. And since some motivations have conflicting interests with others, you cannot, by definition, have everything you want. Going for one thing you want means, by definition, not going for others, and sometimes, it’ll specifically mean going directly _against_ others. The Want Box is a game of compromise.\n\n**The Yearning Octopus**\n\nTo do a proper Want Box audit, you need to think about what you yearn for in a career and then unpack the shit out of it. Luckily, we have someone here who can help us. The Yearning Octopus.\n\n[![](/assets/Octopus-1.png)](https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Octopus-1.png)\n\nWe each have our own personal Yearning Octopus[5](https://waitbutwhy.com/#footnote-5-6721) in our heads. The particulars of each person’s Yearning Octopus will vary, but people also aren’t all that different from each other, and I bet many of us feel very similar yearnings and fears (especially given that I find that Wait But Why readers tend to have a lot in common).\n\nThe first thing to think about is that there are totally distinct yearning _worlds_—each living on one tentacle. These tentacles often do not get along with each other.\n\n[![](/assets/Octopus-2a.png)](https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Octopus-2a.png)\n\n[![](/assets/Octopus-2B.png)](https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Octopus-2B.png)\n\nIt gets worse. Each tentacle is made up of a bunch of different individual yearnings and their accompanying fears—and _these_ often massively conflict with each other too.\n\n[![](/assets/Octopus-3-segmented-1.png)](https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Octopus-3-segmented-1.png)\n\nLet’s take a closer look at each tentacle to see what’s going on.\n\n[![](/assets/personal-tentacle.png)](https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/personal-tentacle.png)\n\nThe Personal Yearnings tentacle is probably the hardest one to generalize here—it’s pretty particular to each of us. It’s a reflection of our specific personality and our values, and it bears the burden of probably the most complex and challenging human need: fulfillment. It’s also in the shit dealing with not only our current selves, but a bunch of our past selves too. The dreams of 7-year-old you and the idealized identity of 12-year-old you and the secret hopes of 17-year-old you and the evolving passions of your current self are all somewhere on the personal tentacle, each throwing their own little fit about getting what they want, and each fully ready to make you feel horrible about yourself with their disappointment and disgust if you fail them. On top of that, your fear of death sometimes emerges on the personal tentacle, all needy about you leaving your mark and achieving greatness and all that. The personal tentacle is why you don’t find very many billionaires content to spend the rest of their life sipping cocktails on the beach—it’s a highly needy tentacle.\n\nAnd yet, the personal tentacle is also one that often ends up somewhat neglected. Because in many cases, it’s the ickiest set of yearnings to really _go_ for; because the fears of this tentacle aren’t scary in an immediate way—they creep in out of the background over time; and because the personal tentacle is always at risk of getting bowled over early in your career by the powerful animal emotions of the other tentacles. This neglect can leave a person with major regrets later on once the dust settles. An unfulfilled Personal Yearnings tentacle is often the explanation, for example, behind a very successful, very unhappy person—who may believe they got successful in the wrong field.\n\n[![](/assets/social-tentacle.png)](https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/social-tentacle.png)\n\nThe Social Yearnings tentacle is probably our most primitive, animal side, with its core drive stemming back to our tribal evolutionary past. On the tentacle are a number of odd creatures.\n\nAs we’ve discussed [before](https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/06/taming-mammoth-let-peoples-opinions-run-life.html) on this blog, we all have a Social Survival Mammoth living in our heads who’s earth-shatteringly obsessed with what other people think of us. This means he craves acceptance and inclusion and being well-liked, while likewise being petrified of embarrassment, negative judgment, and disapproval. He really really really wants to be in the in-group and he really really really doesn’t want to be in the outgroup. He’s [quite cute](https://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Mammoth1.png) though.\n\nThen there’s your ego, who’s a similar character but even more needy. Your ego doesn’t just want to be accepted; it wants to be admired, desired, and fawned upon—ideally, on a mass scale. More upsetting to it than being disliked is being ignored. It wants to be relevant and important and widely known.\n\nThere are other characters milling about as well. Somewhere else on the social tentacle is a little judge with a little gavel who gets very butthurt if it thinks people aren’t judging you fairly—if you’re not appropriately appreciated. It’s very important to the judge that people are aware of exactly how smart and talented you think you are. The judge is also big on holding grudges—which is the reason a lot of people are driven more than anything by a desire to _show_ that person or those people who never believed in them.\n\nFinally, some of us may find a loving little dog on our social tentacle who wants more than anything in the world to please its owner, and who just cannot bear the thought of disappointing them. The one problem with this adorable creature is that its owner isn’t you. It’s a person with so much psychological power over you that, if you’re not careful, you may dedicate your whole career to trying to please them and make them proud. (It’s probably a parent.)\n\n[![](/assets/lifestyle-tentacle.png)](https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/lifestyle-tentacle.png)\n\nThe Lifestyle Yearnings tentacle mostly just wants Tuesday to be a good day. But like, a really pleasant, enjoyable day—with plenty of free time and self-care and relaxation and luxuries.\n\nIt’s also concerned with your life in the big picture being as great as possible—as far as your lifestyle tentacle is concerned, you should be able to do what you want to do in life, when and how you want to do it, with the people you like most. Life should be full of fun times and rich experiences, but it should also roll by smoothly, without too much hard work and as few bumps in the road as possible.\n\nThe issue is, even if you place a high priority on your lifestyle yearnings, it’s pretty difficult to keep the whole tentacle happy at the same time. The part of the tentacle that just wants to sit around and relax will hold you back from sweating to build the kind of career that offers long-term flexibility and the kind of wealth that can make life luxurious and cushy and full of toys. The part of the tentacle that only feels comfortable when the future feels predictable will reject the exact kinds of paths that may generate the long-term freedom another part of the tentacle longs for. The side of you that wants a stress-free life doesn’t get along very well with the side of you that thirsts to be hang gliding off a cliff in Namibia like Richard Branson.\n\n[![](/assets/moral-tentacle-1.png)](https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/moral-tentacle-1.png)\n\nThe Moral Yearnings tentacle thinks the rest of the tentacles of your Yearning Octopus are a real pack of dicks—each one more self-involved and self-indulgent than the next. The parts of you on the moral tentacle look around and see a big world that needs so much fixing; they see billions of people no less worthy than you of a good life who just happened to be born into inferior circumstances; they see an uncertain future ahead that hangs in the balance between utopia and dystopia for life on Earth—a future we can actually push in the right direction if we could only get our other tentacles out of our way. While the other tentacles fantasize about what you would do with your life if you had a billion dollars in the bank, the moral tentacle fantasizes about the kind of impact you could make if you had a billion dollars to _deploy_.\n\nNeedless to say, the other tentacles of your Yearning Octopus find the moral tentacle to be insufferable. They also can’t begin to understand philanthropy for philanthropy’s sake—they think, “Other people aren’t me, so why would I spend my time and energy working to help them?”—but they _can_ understand philanthropy for their own motive’s sake. While the moral and lifestyle tentacles tend to be in direct conflict, others may sometimes find common ground—the social tentacle can get very into philanthropy if it’ll happen to win you respect and admiration from a highly regarded social group, and some people’s personal tentacle may find the meaning or self-worth it so craves in a philanthropic endeavor.\n\nThat’s why, when you do something philanthropic—or anything altruistic, really—there are a few separate things going on in your head. The part of you _determined_ to get proper public credit for the deed lives on your social tentacle; the part of you that thinks “God I’m a good person” lives on your personal tentacle; and the part of you that really loves seeing the person or group you helped be better off lives on your moral tentacle. Likewise, _not_ doing anything for others can hurt you on multiple tentacles—the moral tentacle because it feels guilty and sad, the social tentacle because this may cause others to judge you as a selfish or greedy person, and the personal tentacle because it may lower your self-esteem.\n\n[![](/assets/practical-tentacle.png)](https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/practical-tentacle.png)\n\nYour Practical Yearnings tentacle thinks all of this is fine and great—but it would also like to point out that it’s March 31st and your rent is due tomorrow, and the funny thing about that is that it logged into your bank account and saw that the number of dollars in it is actually less than the number of dollars that your landlord will need from you sometime in the next 34 hours. And yeah it knows that you deposited that check on Thursday and that it’s supposed to clear tomorrow morning, but your practical tentacle also could have sworn that just last month, all the tentacles promised that they’d make some sacrifices in order to build up at least a little bank account cushion so that simply paying the rent wouldn’t have to be really fucking stressful every month. Your practical tentacle also can’t help but notice that your social tentacle offered to buy a round of drinks for all nine people you went to the bar with last Saturday so those people would think of you as a classy, generous person, and that your lifestyle tentacle chose to rent what sure seems like a pretty nice-ass apartment for someone now living check to check, and that the updates have gotten real quiet from your friend about that bagel delivery service he started six months ago that your moral tentacle happily invested $2,500 in to help it get off the ground, and oh also that meanwhile your personal tentacle has everyone sweating their dick off working at two comedy-writing internships simultaneously that somehow manage to bring in less money combined than you made dressing up as an Egyptian enchantress to wait tables at Jekyll & Hyde sophomore year of college.\n\nAt its basic level, your practical tentacle wants to make sure you can eat food and wear clothes and buy the medicine you need and not live outside. It doesn’t really care how these things happen—it just wants them to happen. But then everyone else on the octopus makes your practical tentacle’s life super hard by being fucky about things. Every time your income goes up, your lifestyle tentacle decides to raise the bar on what it wants and expects, leaving your practical tentacle continually in the shit trying to cover it all so you don’t have to run up your credit card debt. Your personal tentacle has all of these weird needs that take up a lot of time and more often than not aren’t exactly big money-makers. And while your practical tentacle would be totally down to just ask your rich uncle for money to help out, your social tentacle outlawed asking others for money because “it’s not a good look,” with your personal tentacle chiming in that “yeah, we’re better than that.”\n\nSo that’s the situation. You’ve got this Yearning Octopus in your head with five tentacles (or however many yours has), each with their own agenda, that often conflict with each other. Then there are the distinct individual yearnings on each tentacle, often in conflict amongst themselves. And if that weren’t enough, you sometimes have furious internal conflict inside a _single_ yearning. Like when your desire to pursue your passion can’t figure out what it’s most passionate about.\n\n[![](/assets/Passion-argument.png)](https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Passion-argument.png)\n\nOr when you want so badly to be respected, but then you remember that a career that wins the undying respect of one segment of society will always receive shrugs from other segments and even contemptuous eye rolls from other segments still.\n\nOr when you decide to satisfy your urge to help others, before realizing that the part of you that wants to dedicate your life to helping to mitigate humanity’s greatest existential risks has palpable disdain for the part of you that would rather make a tangible positive impact on your local community—while the part of you that can’t stand the thought of the millions of today’s humans without access to clean water finds both of those other yearnings to be pretty cold and heartless.\n\nSo yeah, your Yearning Octopus is complicated. And no human in history has ever satisfied their entire octopus—that’s why you’ll never find it fully smiling. Human yearning is a game of choices and sacrifices and compromise.\n\n**Dissecting the Octopus**\n\nWith that in mind, let’s return to your Want Box. When we think about our career goals and fears and hopes and dreams, our consciousness is just accessing the net output of the Yearning Octopus—which is usually made up of its loudest voices. Only by digging into our mind’s subconscious can we see what’s really going on.[6](https://waitbutwhy.com/#footnote-6-6721)\n\nThe cool thing is that we all have the ability to do that. The stuff in your subconscious is like stuff in the basement of a house. It’s not off-limits to us—it’s just in the basement. We can go look at it anytime—we just have to A) remember that the house has a basement, and B) actually spend the time and energy to go down there, even though going down there might suck.\n\nSo let’s head to the basement of your mind to look for the octopus. Unless you’re one of those people who’s really practiced at analyzing your subconscious, it might be dark in the basement, making it hard to see your octopus. The way to start turning the lights on is by identifying what your conscious mind currently knows about your yearnings and fears, and then unpacking it.\n\nLike if there’s a certain career path that sounds fantastic to you, unpack that. Which tentacles in particular are yearning for that career—and which specific parts of those tentacles?\n\nIf you’re not currently working towards that career you supposedly yearn for, try to figure out why not. If you think it’s because you’re afraid of failing, unpack _that_. Fear of failure can emerge from any of the tentacles, so that’s not a specific enough analysis. You want to find the specific source of the fear. Is it a social tentacle fear of embarrassment, or of being judged by others as not that smart, or of appearing to be not that successful to your romantic interests? Is it a personal tentacle fear of damaging your own self-image—of confirming a suspicion about yourself that haunts you? Is it a lifestyle tentacle fear of having to downgrade your living situation, or of bringing stress and instability into a currently predictable life? Or maybe that fear of a living situation downgrade isn’t actually emerging from your lifestyle tentacle, but more so from your social tentacle—in other words, is it possible you’re indifferent about the apartment change itself but super concerned about the _message_ a lifestyle downgrade sends to your friends and family? Or are there financial commitments you simply cannot back out of at the moment, and your practical tentacle is in a genuine panic about how you’ll make ends meet should this career switch take longer than expected to work out, or not work out at all? Or are a few of these combining together to generate your fear of making the leap?\n\nPerhaps you don’t really think it’s fear of failure that’s stopping you, but something else. Maybe it’s a dread of the change in identity—both internally and externally—that inevitably accompanies a career move like this. Maybe it’s the heavy weight of inertia—an intense resistance to change—that seems to exist in and of itself and overpowers all of your other yearnings. In either case, you’d want to unpack the feeling and ask yourself exactly which tentacles are so opposed to an identity shift, or so driven by inertia.\n\nMaybe you pine to be rich. You fantasize about a life where you make $1.2 million a year, and you feel a tremendous drive to make it happen. All five tentacles can feel a desire for wealth under certain circumstances, each for their own reasons. Unpack it.\n\nAs you unpack an inner drive to make money, maybe you discover that at its core, the drive is more for a sense of security than for vast wealth. That can be unpacked too. A yearning for security at its simplest is just your practical tentacle doing what your practical tentacle does. But maybe it’s not actually basic security you want as much as a guarantee of a certain level of fanciness demanded by your lifestyle or social tentacle. Or perhaps what you really want is a level of security so over-the-top secure it can no longer be called a security yearning—instead, it may be an impulse by the emotional well-being section of your lifestyle tentacle to alleviate a compulsive financial stress you were raised to forever feel, almost regardless of your actual financial situation.\n\nThe answers to all of these questions lie somewhere on the tentacles of your Yearning Octopus. And by asking questions like these and digging deep enough to identify the true roots of your various yearnings, you start to turn on the basement light and acquaint yourself with your octopus in all its complexity.\n\nYou’ll also come to understand which of your inner yearnings seem to speak the loudest in your mind and carry the most pull in your decision-making processes. Pretty quickly, a yearning hierarchy will begin to reveal itself. You’ll identify yearnings that speak loudly and get their way; yearnings that cry at the top of their lungs but get continually elbowed out of the way by higher-prioritized parts of the octopus; yearnings that seem resigned to their low-status positions in the hierarchy.\n\n**Searching for Imposters**\n\nWe’re making good progress—but we’re just getting started. Once you have a reasonably clear picture of your Yearning Octopus, you can start doing the real work—work that takes place another level down in your subconscious, in the basement of the basement. Here, you can set up a little interrogation room and one by one, bring each yearning down into it for a cross-examination.\n\nYou’ll start by asking each yearning: how did you end up here, and why are you the way you are? Desires, beliefs, values, and fears don’t materialize out of nowhere. They’re either developed over time by our internal consciousness as observations and life experience pour in, or they’re implanted in us from the outside, by someone else. In other words, they’re the product of either you the chef or you the cook.\n\nSo the goal here in your creepy interrogation room is to tug on the faces of each of your yearnings to find out if it’s authentically you, or if it’s someone else _disguised_ as you.\n\nYou can pull on a yearning’s face by playing the Why Game. You’ll ask your initial Why—*Why is this something I want?—*and get to some kind of Because. Then you’ll keep going. Why did that particular Because lead you to want what you now want? And when did that particular Because gain so much gravity with you? You’ll get to a deeper Because behind the Because. And if you continue with this, you’ll usually discover one of three things:\n\n1. You’ll trace the Why back to its origin and reveal a long chain of authentic evolution that developed through deep independent thought. You’ll pull on their face and confirm that the skin is real.\n\n2. You’ll trace the Why back to an original Because that someone else installed in you—*I guess the only reason I actually have this value is because my mom kind of forced it on me—*and you realize that you never really thought to consider whether you actually independently agree with it. You never stopped to ask yourself whether your own accumulated wisdom actually justifies the level of conviction you feel about that core belief. In a case like this, the yearning is revealed to be an imposter pretending to be an authentic yearning of yours. You pull on its face and it’s a mask that comes off, exposing the yearning’s original installer underneath.\n\n3. You’ll trace the Why back and back and get kind of lost in a haze of “I guess I just know this because it’s true!” This could be an authentic you thing, or just another version of #2, in an instance where you can’t recall the moment this feeling was installed in you. Somewhere deep in you, you’ll have a hunch about which it is.\n\nIn a #1 scenario, you can be proud that you developed that part of you like a chef. It’s an authentic and hard-earned feeling or value.\n\nIn a #2 or maybe #3 scenario, you’ve discovered that you’ve been duped. You’ve let someone else sneak onto your Yearning Octopus while you weren’t looking. When it comes to that particular belief of yours, you’re a cook following someone else’s recipe—an obedient robot reciting desires and fears out of someone else’s brain.\n\nThere’s a chance you’re an unusually wise person whose examination reveals an octopus developed mostly by you and kept readily up to date. More likely, you’re like me and most of my friends—your interrogation room reveals some definite imposters, or at least a lot of ambiguity. Like, underneath one mask, you’ll find your mom.\n\n[![](/assets/mask-1.png)](https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/mask-1.png)\n\n[![](/assets/mask-2.png)](https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/mask-2.png)\n\n[![](/assets/mask-3.png)](https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/mask-3.png)\n\n[![](/assets/mask-4.png)](https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/mask-4.png)\n\n[![](/assets/mask-5-1.png)](https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/mask-5-1.png)\n\nYou’ll pull off others to reveal the values and judgments of broader conventional wisdom, or the viewpoints of your more immediate community, or what’s considered cool by the dominant culture of your generation or the immediate culture within your closest group of friends.\n\n[![](/assets/mask-6.png)](https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/mask-6.png)\n\nSometimes you’ll get to the end of a Why-Because pathway only to find the philosophy in a famous novel, or something a celebrity hero of yours once said in an interview, or a strong opinion one of your professors always repeated.\n\nYou might even find that some of your yearnings and fears were written by you…when you were seven years old. Like a childhood dream that was etched into the back of your consciousness as the thing you believe you _really_ want, when you’re being _truly_ honest.\n\n[![](/assets/mask-7.png)](https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/mask-7.png)\n\n[![](/assets/mask-8-1.png)](https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/mask-8-1.png)\n\nThe interrogation room probably won’t be that fun a time. But it’s time well spent—because you’re not your 7-year-old self, just like you’re not your parents or your friends or your generation or your society or your heroes or your past decisions or your recent circumstances. You’re Current-Age You—the only person, and the only version of yourself, who is actually qualified to want and not want the things you want and don’t want.\n\nTo be clear, this isn’t to say that it’s wrong to live by the words of a wise parent or a famous philosopher or friends you respect or the convictions of a younger you. Humble people are by _definition_ influence-able—influences are an important and inevitable part of who each of us is. The key distinction is this:\n\nDo you treat the words of your external influences as information, held and considered by an authentic inner you, that you’ve carefully decided to embrace? Or are your influences themselves actually in your brain, _masquerading as_ inner you?\n\nDo you want the same thing someone else you know wants because you heard them talk about it, you thought about it alongside your own life experience, and you eventually decided that, for now, you agree? Or because you heard someone talk about what they want or fear, and you thought, “I don’t know shit and that person does, so if they say X is true, I’m sure they’re right”—and then you etched those ideas into your mind, never again feeling the need to question them?\n\nThe former is what chefs do. The latter is what you do when you’re being an obedient robot. And a robot is what you become when at some point you get the idea in your head that someone else is more qualified to be you than you are.\n\nThe good news is that all humans make this mistake—and you can fix it. Just like your subconscious is right there for viewing if you want to view it—it’s also there for changing and updating and rewriting. It’s your head—you’re allowed to do with it what you want.\n\nSo it’s time for some evictions. Masked imposters have to go. Even mom and dad.\n\nAt the end of this, your octopus may look a little barren, leaving you feeling a little like you don’t know who you even are anymore. We usually think of this as a bad feeling, or even an existential crisis, but it actually means you’re doing better than most people.\n\n[![](/assets/roller-coaster-1-2.png)](https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/roller-coaster-1-2.png)\n\nThe drop from naive over-confidence to wise, realistic humility never feels good, but pausing the roller coaster while it’s still on that first cliff and avoiding the pain—which turns out to be a lot of people’s move—isn’t a great strategy. Wisdom isn’t correlated with knowledge, it’s correlated with being in touch with reality—it’s not how far to the right you are on the graph, it’s how close you are to the orange line. Wisdom hurts at first, but it’s the only place where actual growth happens. The irony is that the cliff-pausers of the world like to make the wiser, braver valley-dwellers or continual-climbers feel bad about themselves—because they fundamentally don’t get how knowing yourself works. They haven’t reached that stage yet.\n\nGetting to know your real self is super hard and never complete. But if you’ve tumbled off the cliff, you’ve gone through a key rite of passage and progress is now possible. As you climb up the orange line, you’ll slowly but surely begin to repopulate your Yearning Octopus with your real self.\n\nAt the moment, it probably won’t be obvious what those missing yearnings of yours are exactly—because they’re on an even deeper floor of your subconscious. They’re in the basement of the basement of the basement—in a place called Denial Prison.\n\n**Denial Prison**\n\nOur brain’s Denial Prison is a place most of us don’t even know is there—it’s where we put the parts of us we repress and deny.\n\nThe authentic yearnings of ours that we’re in touch with—i.e. those that proved to be authentic during interrogation—were easy parts of our true selves to find in our subconscious, lying in plain sight, right below the surface of our consciousness. Even our conscious mind knows these yearnings well, because they frequently make their way upstairs into our thoughts. These are the parts of us we have a healthy relationship with.\n\nBut then there are the parts of you that weren’t living on your octopus where they’re supposed to be—instead, you found an imposter in their place. These lost parts of you are often incredibly hard to access, because they’ve been living deep in your subconscious, on a floor so low it’s almost not there at all. Almost.\n\nSome parts of us are banished down on basement #3 because they’re extraordinarily painful for us to acknowledge or think about. Sometimes new parts of us are born only to be immediately locked up in prison as part of a denial of our own evolution—i.e. out of stubbornness. But there are other times when a part of us is in Denial Prison because someone _else_ locked it up down there. In the case of your yearnings, some of them will have been put there by whatever masked intruder had been taking its place. If dad has successfully convinced you that you care deeply about having a prestigious career, he probably has also convinced you that the part of you that, deep down, really wants to be a carpenter isn’t really you and isn’t what you really want. At some point during your childhood, he threw your passion for carpentry into a dark, dank Denial Prison cell.\n\nSo let’s gather your courage and head down to the basement of the basement of the basement of your mind and see what we find.\n\n[![](/assets/denial-prison-1-1.png)](https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/denial-prison-1-1.png)\n\nYou may pass some unpleasant characters.\n\n[![](/assets/denial-prison-2.png)](https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/denial-prison-2.png)\n\nLeave them for another time—right now, search for locked-away career-related yearnings. Maybe you’ll find a repressed passion to teach. Or a desire to be famous that your particular tribe has shamed you out of. Or a deep love of long blocks of free, open leisure time that your hornier, greedier teenage self kicked downstairs in favor of a raging ambition.\n\nThere will be certain parts of your authentic self you won’t be able to uncover in Denial Prison—it’s pretty dark down there. But be patient—now that you’ve done your audit and cleared space for them on your octopus, they may begin to emerge.\n\n**Priority Rankings**\n\nThe other part of our Yearning Octopus audit will address the hierarchy of your yearnings. Almost as important as the yearnings themselves is the priority they’re given. The hierarchy is easy to see because it’s revealed in your actions. You may like to think a desire to do something bold is high up on your hierarchy, but if you’re not currently working on something bold, it reveals that however important boldness is to you, something else—some source of fear or inertia in you—is currently being prioritized above it.\n\nIt’s important to remember that a ranking of yearnings is also a ranking of fears. The octopus contains anything that could make you want or not want to pursue a certain career, and the reverse side of each yearning is its accompanying fear of the opposite. The reverse side of your yearning to be admired is a fear of embarrassment. If you flip over your desire for self-actualization, you’ll see a fear of underachieving. The other half of your craving of self-esteem is a fear of feeling shame. If your actions don’t seem to match what you believe is the internal hierarchy of your yearnings, usually it’s because you’re forgetting to think about the role your fears are playing. What looks like a determined drive for success, for example, might actually be someone running _away_ from a negative self-image or trying to escape feelings like envy or under-appreciation. If your actions seem beholden to yearnings that you don’t believe you actually care that much about, you’re probably not looking closely enough at your fears.\n\nWith both yearnings and fears in mind, think about what your internal hierarchy might look like, and return that same important question: “Who made this order? Was it really me?”\n\nFor example, we’re often told to “follow our passion”—this is society saying “put your passion yearnings at the top of your hierarchy.” That’s a very specific instruction. Maybe that’s the right thing for you, but it also very well might not be. It’s something you need to independently evaluate.\n\nTo get this right, let’s try to do a fresh ranking, from first principles, based on who we really are, how we’ve evolved over time, and what really matters to us most, right now.\n\nThis isn’t about which yearnings or fears have the loudest voices or which fears are most palpable—if it were, you’d be letting your impulses take the wheel of your life. The person doing the ranking is _you_—the little center of consciousness reading this post who can observe your octopus and look at it objectively. This involves another kind of compromise. On one side, you’ll try to tap into all the wisdom you’ve accumulated throughout your life and make active decisions about values—about what you really believe is _important_. On the other side, it’s about self-acceptance and self-compassion. Sometimes you’ll have strong undeniable yearnings that you’re not super proud of—whether you like it or not, those are part of you, and when you neglect them, they may cause a continual stink and make you miserable. Creating your yearning hierarchy is a give and take between what’s important and what’s you. It’s probably a good goal to give higher priority to your more noble qualities, but it’s okay to throw a bone to some of your not-so-noble sides as well—depending on where you decide to draw the line. There’s a wisdom to knowing when to accept your not-so-noble side and when to reject it entirely.\n\nTo get all of this in order, we want a good system. You can play around with what works for you—I like the idea of a shelf:\n\n[![](/assets/yearning-hierarchy-2.png)](https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/yearning-hierarchy-2.png)\n\nThis divides things into five categories. The absolutely highest priority inner drives get to go in the extra special non-negotiable bowl. The NN bowl is for yearnings _so_ important to you that you want to essentially guarantee that they’ll happen—at the expense of all other yearnings, if necessary. This is why so many of history’s legends were famously single-minded—they had a very intense NN bowl yearning and it led them to world fame, often at the expense of relationships, balance, and health. The bowl is small because it should be used very sparingly—if at all. Like maybe only one thing gets it. Or _maybe_ two or three. Too many things in the NN bowl cancels out its power, making that the same as having nothing in the bowl at all.\n\nYour group of top shelf yearnings is mostly what will drive your career choices—but top shelf placement should also be doled out sparingly (that’s why it’s not a very large shelf). Shelf placement is as much about de-prioritizing as it is about prioritizing. You’re not just choosing which parts of you are the most important to make you happy, you’re choosing which parts of you to intentionally leave wanting or even directly opposed. No matter what your hierarchy looks like, some yearnings will be left feeling very unhappy and some fears will feel like they’re being continually assaulted. This is inevitable.\n\nThat’s why most yearnings should be on the middle shelf, the bottom shelf, or the trash can. The middle shelf is good for those not-so-noble qualities in you that you decide to accept. They deserve some of your attention. And they’ll often demand it—core parts of you won’t go quietly into non-prioritization, and they sometimes can really ruin your life if they’re neglected.\n\nMost of the rest will end up on the bottom shelf. Putting a part of you on the bottom shelf is telling it, “I know you want these things, but for now, I’ve decided other things are more important. I promise to revisit you a little later, after I’ve gotten some more information, and if I change my mind, you’ll get a shelf upgrade then.” The best way to think of the bottom shelf is this: the more yearnings you can convince to accept a bottom shelf rating, the better the chances your top shelf and NN bowl yearnings have of getting what they want. Likewise, the fewer yearnings you put on the _top_ shelf, the more likely those on the top shelf will be to thrive. Your time and energy are severely limited, so this is a zero-sum compromise. The amateur mistake is to be too liberal with the NN bowl and top shelf and too sparing with the large bottom shelf.\n\nThen there’s the trash can, for the drives and fears you flat-out reject—those parts of you that fundamentally violate the person your wisest self wants to be. A good amount of inner conflict emerges from people’s trash cans, and trash can control is a major component of integrity and inner strength. But like the rest of your hierarchy decisions, your criteria for what qualifies as trash should be derived from your own deep thought, not from what others tell you is and is not trash.\n\nAs you go through this difficult prioritizing process—inevitably, at times, against the screaming protests of unhappily deprioritized yearnings—remember that you’re the only wise one in the room. Yearnings and fears are impatient and bad at seeing the big picture. Even a seemingly high-minded yearning, like those on the moral tentacle, can’t understand the complete picture in the way you can. Many of the people who have done wonders to make the world better got there on a path that started with selfish motives like wealth or personal fulfillment—motives their moral tentacle probably hated at first. The octopus won’t be the wise adult in the room—that’s your job.\n\n[![](/assets/octopus-no-bones-1.png)](https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/octopus-no-bones-1.png)\n\nFinally, as we’ll discuss more later, this is not a permanent decision. It’s the opposite—it’s a rough draft written in light pencil. It’s a hypothesis that you’ll be able to test and then revise based on how actually living this hierarchy feels in practice.\n\nYour Want Box is ready to go. Now let’s turn to your Reality Box.\n\n**Deep Analysis, Part 2: Your Reality Box**\n\nThe Want Box deals with what you find desirable. The Reality Box deals with what’s _possible_.\n\nBut when we examined the Want Box, it became clear that it’s not necessarily based on what you actually want—it’s based on what you _think_ you want—what you’re in the _habit_ of wanting.\n\nThe Reality Box is the same deal. It doesn’t show you reality, it shows your best crack at what reality might be—your _perception_ of reality.\n\nThe goal of self-reflection is to bring both of these boxes as close to accuracy as possible. We want our perceived yearnings to be a true reflection of our authentic inner selves, and we want our beliefs about what’s possible to come close to mirroring what’s actually possible. For our Want Box audit, we looked under the hood of the Want Box and found its settings—your yearnings and fears. When we open the hood of your Reality Box, we see a group of _beliefs_.\n\nWhen it comes to your career possibilities, you’re dealing with two sets of beliefs: beliefs about the world and beliefs about your own potential. For a career option to qualify for your Reality Box, your potential in that career area has to measure up to the objective difficulty of achieving success in that area.\n\nUs being us, we’re probably pretty bad at assessing either side of this comparison accurately.\n\nI don’t know how you think about career path difficulty, but in my experience, people often see it like this:\n\nThere are traditional careers—stuff like medicine or law or teaching or a corporate ladder, etc.—and these careers have predictable, set paths. If you’re decently smart and work hard, you’ll end up in a successful, stable situation.\n\nThen there are less traditional careers—the arts, entrepreneurship, non-profit work, politics, etc.—and these are wildcards. Success and stability are no guarantee, and to reach great heights, it’s either a lottery ticket game of luck, a genetic lottery game of innate talent, or some combination of the two.\n\nThese are perfectly reasonable assumptions—if you live in 1952. Your beliefs about the world of careers and about what it takes to succeed need just as thorough an unmasking as your yearnings did—and I suspect that behind most of them, you’ll find big, fat conventional wisdom. You might first pull off the mask of one of your beliefs and find your parents or your friends or your college career coach—but if you keep going and pull on _their_ face, you’ll usually see that it’s also a mask, and conventional wisdom is there hiding behind it. A general conception, a common opinion, an oft-cited statistic[7](https://waitbutwhy.com/#footnote-7-6721)—none of which have actually been verified by you, but all of which are treated as gospel by society.\n\nToday’s world goes through dramatic changes each decade, which usually leaves conventional wisdom wildly outdated. But we’re wired for a more ancient world where almost nothing ever changed, so we all reason like cooks and treat conventional wisdom as equivalent to truth.\n\nThese problems then extend to how we view our own potential. When you overrate the impact of innate talent on how people fare in their careers—and you also conflate talent and skill level—it won’t leave you feeling great about your chances at many paths. Because we better understand the trajectory of traditional careers, we’re less prone to do this with them. A first-year medical student sees an experienced surgeon at work and thinks, “I can get there one day—just need to do about 20 years of hard work.” But when a young artist or entrepreneur or software engineer looks at the equivalent of the experienced surgeon in their field, they’re more likely to think, “Wow look how talented they are—I’m nowhere near that good,” and get all hopeless. There’s also the other common notion, that people who thrive in non-traditional careers had some “big break” at some point, like hitting a lucky scratch card jackpot—and I don’t know many people who want to risk their careers on scratch cards.\n\nThese are only a few examples of the slew of delusions and misconceptions we tend to have about how great careers happen. So let’s brainstorm how it might actually work:\n\n**The Career Landscape**\n\nI have no idea, mostly. And I think most people have no idea. Things are just changing too quickly.\n\nBut that’s kind of the key point. If you can figure out how to get a reasonably accurate picture of the real career landscape out there, you have a massive edge over everyone else, most of whom will be using conventional wisdom as their instruction booklet.\n\nFirst, there’s the broad landscape—the set of all the jobs someone could possibly have in today’s society. My current job description is: “Writer of 8,000-to-40,000-word articles about a bunch of different topics, with cursing and stick figures, on a remarkably sporadic schedule.” Think conventional wisdom has any job openings for me with that description? The landscape today is made up of thousands of options—some 40 years old, some made possible only three months ago because of the advent of some new technology—and the way things work today, if there’s an option you want that’s not already out there, you can probably create it for yourself. Pretty stressful, but also incredibly exciting.\n\nThen, there’s each specific career path. A career path is like a game board. The conventional wisdom bookshelf contains instruction booklets for only a small fraction of today’s available game boards—and those that it does have usually tell you how that game was played in the past, even though the current game board has evolved significantly into something with new kinds of opportunities and different rules and loopholes. When you consider a career path today, to make an accurate assessment of what the path looks like and what kinds of strength-weakness profiles it favors, you have to understand what that career’s current game board looks like. Otherwise, it’s like trying to evaluate your chances of being a professional basketball player based on your height and strength without realizing that, say, basketball has evolved and is now played on oversize courts that contain 10 different 7-foot hoops, and the current game favors speed over height and strength.\n\nThis is promising news. There are likely dozens of awesome career paths that beautifully match your natural strengths, _and_ it’s likely that most other people trying to succeed on those paths are playing with an outdated rulebook and strategy guide. If you simply understand what the game board really looks like and play by modern rules, you have a huge advantage.\n\n**Your Potential**\n\nAnd this brings us to you and your particular strengths. Not only do we assess our strengths based on the wrong game boards (like in our basketball example)—even when we have the _right_ game board in mind, we’re often bad at identifying the real strengths that that game calls for.\n\nWhen assessing your chances on a certain career path, the key question is:\n\n_With enough time, could you get good enough at this game to potentially reach whatever your definition of success is in that career?_\n\nI like to view this journey to “good enough at the game to succeed” as a distance. The distance starts with where you are now—point A—and ends with you reaching your definition of success, which we can draw with a star.\n\n[![](/assets/A-star-1-1.png)](https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/A-star-1-1.png)\n\nThe length of the distance depends on where point A is (how far along you are at the current moment) and where the star is (how lofty your definition of success is).\n\nSo if you’re a college graduate who majored in computer science and your career goal is to be a middle-of-the-ladder engineer at Google, your distance might look like this:\n\n[![](/assets/A-star-2-1.png)](https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/A-star-2-1.png)\n\nBut if you’ve never done any kind of computer science before, and your career goal is to be the top engineer at Google, you’ve got a much longer road ahead:\n\n[![](/assets/A-star-3-1.png)](https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/A-star-3-1.png)\n\nIf your goal is to create the new Google, the road gets much, much longer.\n\n[![](/assets/A-star-4-2.png)](https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/A-star-4-2.png)\n\nAt this point, conventional wisdom might emerge as a voice in your head and point out that simply getting good enough at a certain skill doesn’t actually guarantee success—you might reach the star on a career path and still find that you haven’t “made it” yet.\n\nThat’s mostly wrong, because it’s misunderstanding the star. The star isn’t about a particular skill level—e.g. coding ability or acting skills or business savvy—it’s about the entire _game_. In traditional careers, the games tend to be more straightforward—if you want to be a top surgeon, and you get incredibly good at surgery, you’ve probably hit your star and you’ll have your career. But the game boards in less traditional careers often involve many more factors. Reaching the “I want to be a famous actor” star doesn’t simply mean getting as good at acting as Morgan Freeman, it means getting as good at the entire actor _game_ as most movie stars get by the time they break through. Acting ability is only one piece of that puzzle—you also need a knack for getting yourself in front of people with power, a shrewdness for personal branding, an insane amount of optimism, a ridiculous amount of hustle and persistence, etc. If you get good enough at that _whole_ game—every component of it—your chances of becoming an A-list movie star are actually pretty high. _That’s_ what hitting the star means.\n\nBut conventional wisdom doesn’t get how non-traditional careers work—it only thinks in terms of a narrow aspect of success: talent and hard work. When career paths have game boards with much more going on, conventional wisdom just throws its hands up and calls it “luck.” To conventional wisdom, becoming a movie star requires some talent, but mostly, hitting a rare scratch ticket jackpot.\n\nSo how do you figure out your chances of getting to any particular star? It’s all about a simple formula:\n\nDistance = Speed x Time.\n\nIn our case, the more apt wording might be:\n\nProgress = Pace x Persistence.\n\nYour outlook on any career quest depends on A) the pace at which you’ll be able to improve at playing that career’s “game” and B) the amount of time you’re willing to persist in chasing that star. Let’s talk about both of these:\n\n**Pace**\n\nWhat makes someone slower or faster at improving at a career game? I’d say it comes down to three factors:\n\n**Your level of chefness.** As we discussed earlier, chefs look at the world with fresh eyes and build conclusions based on what they observe and what they’ve experienced. Cooks arrive at conclusions by following someone else’s recipe—in the case of careers, the recipe is usually conventional wisdom. Careers are complex games that almost everyone starts off bad at—then the chefs improve rapidly through a continual loop…\n\n[![](/assets/Chef-Strategy-Loop-1.png)](https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Chef-Strategy-Loop-1.png)\n\n…while cooks improve at a snail’s pace, because their strategy is just following a recipe which itself barely changes. What’s more, in a world where career games are constantly evolving and morphing, the chef’s tactics can evolve in real time and keep up. Meanwhile, the cook’s recipe just grows more and more outdated—a problem they remain oblivious to. This is why I’m pretty convinced that at least for less traditional careers, your level of chefness is the single most important factor in determining your pace of improvement.\n\n**Your work ethic.** This one is obvious. Someone who works on their career 60 hours a week, 50 weeks a year, is going to move down the path almost four times faster than someone who works 20 hours a week, 40 weeks a year. Someone who chooses a balanced lifestyle will move slower than a single-minded workaholic. Someone with a propensity towards laziness or procrastination is going to lose a lot of ground to someone who’s good at putting in consistent work days. Someone who frequently breaks from work to daydream or pick up their phone is going to get less done in each work hour than someone who practices deep focus.\n\n**Your natural abilities.** Talent does matter. Smarter, more talented people will improve at a game at a faster rate than less naturally gifted people. But intelligence and talent are only two types of natural ability that come into play here. Cleverness and savvy matter too, and those qualities don’t always correlate with raw intelligence. Depending on the type of career, social skills can be critically important as well. In many careers, likable (or subtly manipulative) people have a big advantage over less likable people—and those who enjoy socializing will put in more people hours over time, and build deeper relationships, than antisocial types.\n\nOther things, like existing connections, existing resources, and existing skills matter, of course, but they’re not components of pace—they’re part of the location of point A.\n\n**Persistence**\n\nWhen I say persistence, I’m referring to long-term persistence (as opposed to day-to-day work ethic). Persistence is simpler than pace. The more years you’re willing to commit to chasing a star, the farther along the road towards the star you’ll get. A car going 30 mph that quits driving after 15 minutes gets a lot less far than a car that drives 10 mph for two hours.\n\nAnd this is why persistence is so important. Someone who has decided they’re only willing to give a dream career a shot for three years before they’ll go for their fallback plan has essentially disqualified themselves from a chance at their dreams. It doesn’t matter how awesome you are—if you’ll give up after two or three years of not breaking through, you’re unlikely to succeed. A few years is just not enough time to traverse the typically long distances it takes to get to the raddest success stars, no matter how impressive your pace.\n\n**Your Real Strengths and W\\*\\***eaknesses\\*\\*\n\nWith our pace-times-persistence equation in mind, let’s revisit the concept of strengths and weaknesses. It’s not that “strengths and weaknesses” is a bad concept—it’s that we think about it all wrong. When we list our strengths, we tend to list our areas of existing skill more than anything else. Instead, strengths should be all about pace and persistence qualities. Originality or lack thereof should be a critical component of the discussion, making qualities like agility and humility (trademark chef traits) notable strengths, and qualities like stubbornness[8](https://waitbutwhy.com/#footnote-8-6721) or intellectual laziness (classic cook traits) important weaknesses. The subtleties of work ethic, like a knack for deep focus or a propensity to procrastinate, should also be a major part of the discussion, as should natural abilities beyond talent, like savvy and likability. Qualities related to persistence, like resilience and determination and patience, should be thought of as promising strengths, while a social tentacle clamoring to appear successful as quickly as possible should be viewed as a bright red flag.\n\nMost importantly, these items shouldn’t be discussed as a snapshot of where they are now, but rather in terms of your _potential for improvement_ in each of them. If you handed 25-year-old Michael Jordan a basketball for the first time, he’d suck. But calling basketball a “weakness” of his would be getting it very wrong. Instead, you’d want to watch him practice over the next six weeks and evaluate the slope of his improvement. This lesson applies to specific skills—but most general pace and persistence qualities can _also_ be worked on and improved if you focus on them.\n\n**Filling in the Reality Box**\n\nYour true Reality Box would literally include all career paths for which you think a highly improved version of yourself could, with an entire lifetime of effort, reach the minimum star you’d be comfortable defining as success. This would be an impossibly big list, only ruling out paths that are clearly far too long for you to traverse at your maximum possible pace on the path (like me chasing a career as an Olympic figure skater). But it’s still useful to pause for a minute and reflect on the vast extent of your full Reality Box—just acknowledging how many options are truly open to you can put you in the right mindset.[9](https://waitbutwhy.com/#footnote-9-6721)\n\nSo to be a bit more efficient, let’s worry about the parts of the Reality Box that might actually end up in your Option Pool (the middle of the Venn diagram where the Want and Reality Boxes overlap). To complete our Reality Box audit with that caveat, we need to evaluate:\n\n**1) The general landscape.** Take our best crack at evaluating the world’s current career landscape—the full range of options available (or create-able).\n\n**2) Specific game boards.** For any careers that sound remotely interesting, ponder what the deal might be with that career’s current game board—the parties involved, the way success seems to be happening for others recently, the most up-to-date rules of the game, the latest new loopholes that are being exploited, etc.\n\n**3) Starting point.** For those paths, evaluate your starting point, based on your current skills, resources, and connections relevant to that field.\n\n**4) Success point.** Think about end points and where on each line your star should be placed. Ask yourself what’s the minimum level of success you’d need to achieve in order to feel happy about having chosen that career path.\n\n**5) Your pace.** Make an initial estimate for what your pace of improvement might be on these various game boards, based on your current pace-related strengths and how much you think you can improve at each of them (in other words, how much your speed might be able to _accelerate_).\n\n**6) Your level of persistence.** Evaluate the amount of time you think you’ll be willing to put into each of these respective paths.\n\nNow it’s just math. You take your game board and make it a line, you plot starting points and success stars that together generate the various distances in front of you, and for each, you multiply your pace by your level of persistence. If it seems like the product of your pace and persistence for a given career path might be able to measure up to the path’s total length, that career lands in your Reality Box. Of course, it’s impossible to get exact values for any of the above factors, but it’s good to at least know the equation you’re working with.\n\nA from-first-principles Reality Box audit may bring some overly optimistic people down to Earth, but I suspect that for most, an audit will leave them feeling like they have a lot more options than they realized, empowering them to set their sights on a bolder direction.\n\nA good Reality Box reflection warrants yet another Want Box reflection. Reframing a bunch of career paths in your mind will affect your level of yearning for some of them. One career may seem less appealing after reminding yourself that it will entail thousands of hours of networking or multiple decades of pre-success struggle. Another may seem less daunting after changing your mind about how much luck is actually involved. There will be other career paths you hadn’t considered wanting because you hadn’t considered them as real options, but some deep reflection has opened your mind to them.\n\nThis brings us to the end of our long, two-part deep dive. After a fairly exhausting box-auditing process, we can return to our Venn[10](https://waitbutwhy.com/#footnote-10-6721) diagram.\n\n[![](/assets/venn-1.png)](https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/venn-1.png)\n\nAssuming some things have changed, you have a new Option Pool to look at—a new list of options on the table that seem both desirable to your high-priority rankings and possible to achieve. We’re ready now to return to where we were before we started our analysis: the present moment. With these options in front of us, we’re ready to lift our heads up out of analysis and look forward into the future.\n\n**Connecting the Dots into the Future**\n\nIt’s time to bring back your Career Plans map that I made you put down at the beginning of the post—the one with the arrow or the question mark. If there had been a clear arrow on your map before your audit, check out your new Option Pool. Given everything you’ve reflected upon, does your current career plan still qualify to be there? If so, congrats—you’re ahead of most of us.\n\nIf not, well that’s shitty news, but it’s also good news. Remember, going from a false arrow to a question mark is always major progress in life.\n\n[![](/assets/roller-coaster-2-2.png)](https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/roller-coaster-2-2.png)\n\nAnd actually, a new question mark implies having made the key cliff jump on _two_ roller coasters: getting to know yourself and getting to know the world. Major step in the right direction. Cross out the arrow and join the question mark crowd.\n\nNow the question mark crowd has a tough choice. You gotta pick one of the arrows in the Option Pool.\n\nIt’s a tough choice—but it should be _way less tough_ than it is. Here’s why:\n\nCareers used to be kind of like a 40-year tunnel. You picked your tunnel, and once you were in, that was that. You worked in that profession for 40 years or so before the tunnel spit you out on the other side into your retirement.\n\n[![](/assets/tunnels-2.png)](https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/tunnels-2.png)\n\nThe truth is, careers have probably never really functioned like 40-year-tunnels, they just seemed that way. At best, traditional careers of the past played out _kind_ of like tunnels.\n\nToday’s careers—especially the less traditional ones—are really really not like tunnels. But crusty old conventional wisdom has a lot of us still viewing things that way, which makes the already hard job of making big career path choices much harder.\n\nWhen you think of your career as a tunnel, it causes an identity crisis in anyone who doesn’t feel sure of who exactly they are and who they’ll want to be decades from now—which is most sane people. It enhances the delusion that what we do for work is a synonym for who we are, making a question mark on your map seem like an existential disaster.\n\nWhen you think of your career as a tunnel, the stakes to make the right choice seem so high that it explodes the feeling of tyranny of choice. For perfectionist types especially, this can be utterly paralyzing.\n\nWhen you think of your career as a tunnel, you lose the courage to make a career switch, even when your soul is begging for it. It makes switching careers feel incredibly risky and embarrassing, and it suggests that someone who does so is a failure. It also makes all kinds of multi-faceted, vibrant, mid-career people feel like they’re too old to make a bold switch or start a whole new path afresh.\n\nBut conventional wisdom still tells many of us that careers are tunnels. As the icing on its shit cake—on top of helping us yearn for things we don’t actually want, deny yearnings that we feel deep down, fear things that aren’t dangerous, and believe things about the world and our potential that aren’t accurate—conventional wisdom tells us that careers are a tunnel to help us daunt the shit out of ourselves unnecessarily.\n\nToday’s career landscape isn’t a lineup of tunnels, it’s a massive, impossibly complex, rapidly changing science laboratory. Today’s people aren’t synonymous with what they do—they’re impossibly complex, rapidly changing scientists. And today’s career isn’t a tunnel, or a box, or an identity label—it’s a long series of science experiments.\n\nSteve Jobs [compared](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF8uR6Z6KLc) life to connecting the dots, pointing out that while it’s easy to look at your past and see how the dots connected to lead you to where you are, it’s basically impossible in life to connect the dots forwards.\n\nIf you look at the biographies of your heroes, you’ll see that their paths look a lot more like a long series of connected dots than a straight and predictable tunnel. If you look at yourself and your friends, you’ll probably see the same trend—according to [data](https://web.archive.org/web/20170420130623/https://www.bls.gov/news.release/tenure.nr0.htm), the median time a young person stays in a given job is only 3 years (older people spend a longer time on each dot, but not that much longer—10.4 years on average).\n\nSo seeing your career as a series of dots isn’t a mental trick to help you make decisions—it’s an accurate depiction of what’s actually happening. And seeing your career as a tunnel isn’t just unproductive—it’s delusional.\n\nLikewise, you’re limited to focusing mainly on the next dot on your path—because it’s the only dot you _can_ figure out. You don’t have to worry about dot #4 because you can’t anyway—you’re literally not qualified to do so.\n\nBy the time dot #4 rolls around, you will have learned stuff about yourself you don’t know now. You’ll also have changed from who you are now, and your Yearning Octopus will reflect those changes. You’ll know a lot more than you currently do about the career landscape and the specific game boards you’re interested in, and you’ll have become a much better game player. And of course, that landscape—and those game boards—will have themselves evolved.\n\nThe fantastic website [80,000 Hours](https://80000hours.org/) (which exists to help young, talented people work through their career choices) has compiled a lot of data to back this up: data on the fact that [you’ll change](https://80000hours.org/2015/02/we-change-more-than-we-expect-so-keep-your-options-open/), that [the world will change](https://80000hours.org/2015/02/which-careers-will-be-automated/), and that [you’ll only learn with time what you’re actually good at](https://80000hours.org/career-guide/personal-fit/). Popular psychologist Dan Gilbert also eloquently [describes](http://www.randomhouse.com/kvpa/gilbert/) just how bad we are at predicting what will make us happy in the future.\n\nPretending you can figure out what dot #2 or #4 or #8 should be now is laughable. Future dots are the worry of a future, wiser you living in a future world. So let’s focus on dot #1.\n\nIf we’re thinking of ourselves as scientists and of society as a science lab, we should think of your current freshly revised Want-Reality Venn Diagram as nothing more than an early, rough hypothesis. Dot #1 is your chance to test it out.\n\nHypothesis testing is intuitive in the dating world. If a friend were toiling over what kind of person she wants to marry but never went out with anyone, you’d tell her, “You can’t figure this out on your couch—you’ve gotta start going on dates, and that’ll teach you what you want in a partner.” If that friend then went on a solid first date and returned home to toil for hours about whether or not this new person was The One, you’d again have to correct her. You’d say, “There’s no way you can know that from just one date! You have to get some experience dating this person to learn what you need to learn to make that decision.”\n\nWe can all agree that this hypothetical friend is pretty nuts and is lacking a fundamental understanding of how you find a happy relationship. So let’s not be like her when it comes to picking our career. Dot #1 is a chill situation—it’s just a first date.\n\nThis is awesome news—because it makes it a lot less scary to draw an arrow on your map if it’s only an arrow to dot #1 of your future. The real cause of tyranny of choice is accurately seeing the sheer number of options you have in today’s world while delusionally seeing those careers as the 40-year tunnels of yesterday’s world. That’s a lethal combo. Reframing your next major career decision as a far lower-stakes choice makes the number of options exciting, not stressful.\n\nAnd that’s all great in theory. But now comes the hard part.\n\n**Making Your Move**\n\nYou’ve reflected and reflected and reflected and weighed and measured and predicted and considered. You’ve chosen a dot and drawn an arrow. And now you have to actually make the move.\n\nWe’re super bad at this. We’re frightened people. We don’t like icky things and making a bold, real-life step is icky. If there’s any ounce of procrastination susceptibility in us, here’s where it’ll show itself.\n\nThe Yearning Octopus can help. As we discussed earlier, your behavior at any given point simply displays the configuration of your octopus. If you’ve decided on a life step and you can’t quite take it, it’s because the parts of you that don’t want to make a move are ranked higher in your subconscious than the parts of you that do. Your conscious mind may have tried to assign lower shelf ratings to the parts of your octopus that lean towards inertia, but your yearnings have rebelled. You’re a CEO not in control of their staff.\n\nTo fix this problem, think like a kindergarten teacher. In your class, a faction of the 5-year-olds is rebelling against your wishes. What do you do?\n\nGo talk to the 5-year-olds that are causing the trouble. They’re unpleasant, defiant simpletons, but they can still be reasoned with. Talk to them about why you’ve ranked them lower than others in the octopus hierarchy. Describe to them the insights you gained from your Reality Box reflection. Remind them about how connecting the dots works and about the chillness of dot #1. You’re the teacher—figure it out.\n\nThe older I get, the clearer it becomes that our internal battle as the kindergarten teachers of our mind is like 97% of life’s struggle. The world is easy—_you’re_ difficult. If you find yourself continually not executing your plans in life and your promises to yourself, you’ve uncovered your new #1 priority—becoming a better kindergarten teacher. Until you do, your life will be run by a bunch of primitive, short-sighted 5-year-olds, and your whole shit will suck. Trust me, I know.\n\nIf your inner analysis does call for a career leap to a new dot, I hope that at some point, you’re able to make the jump.\n\n**After the Move**\n\nJumping to a new dot is a liberating feeling, usually side by side with some substantial internal havoc.\n\nFirst of all, for a while at least, you’ll probably suck at what you’re doing on your new dot. While your wise self will know that’s exactly how it should be, your less wise selves will go into full existential meltdown mode. All of the fears you so thoughtfully deprioritized in your octopus ranking will think someone is murdering them and they’ll start trying to call 911. The yearnings you did prioritize won’t be feeling much gratification yet, and they’ll wonder if they were wrong all along about what they thought they wanted. The yearnings you didn’t prioritize will get out the guitar and start singing love songs for the greener-seeming grass you deprived them of. It won’t be much fun.\n\nEven if things do go well, you’ll be quickly reminded of the fact that the Yearning Octopus is a generally unhappy creature. Core pieces of the octopus will feel neglected or even assaulted, and every day that goes by, you’ll be bearing the opportunity cost of the paths you were considering but chose not to walk down—the versions of you in parallel universes where you made other choices. You’ll think about their hypothetical advancement in the world and worry about what you may have passed up.\n\n[![](/assets/opportunity-cost-2.png)](https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/opportunity-cost-2.png)\n\nAs you get wiser, you’ll learn to view a largely unhappy octopus with acceptance. You’ll let it whine and get good at tuning it out, knowing that it’s whining in the exact way you planned for it to be.\n\nThe whining octopus is a reminder of why pure, elated happiness is never a reasonable goal. The times you feel pure happiness are temporary, drug-induced delusions—like the honeymoon phase of a new relationship or new job or the high following a long-awaited success. Those moments are the perfect golf shots of a mediocre golfer’s outing—they’re awesome, and you should enjoy the shit out of them—but they’re not the new normal, and they never will be.\n\nA better goal is contentment: the satisfying feeling that you’re currently taking the best crack you can at a good life path; that what you’re working on might prove to be a piece of an eventual puzzle you can feel really proud of. Chasing happiness is an amateur move. Feeling contentment in those times when your choices and your circumstances have combined to pull it off, and knowing you have all that you could ever ask for, is for the wise.\n\nPeople talk about being present in the moment, but there’s also the broader concept of macro-presence: feeling broadly present in your own life. If you’re on a career dot that, when you’re being really honest with yourself, feels right, you get to stop thinking and stop planning for a while and just dig in. You’ll come back to the big picture later—for now, you can put the macro picture aside, put your head down, and dedicate all of your energy to the present. For a while, you can just _live_.\n\nThese moments don’t always last that long, so sink your teeth in. Put everything you’ve got into the dot you’ve chosen. As far as you know, you might be Michael Jordan holding his first basketball, so start playing.\n\n**The Next Dot?**\n\nAt some point, your good feelings about the macro picture may sour. And when they do, you’ll have to get back into analysis mode and figure out what, in particular, is causing the restlessness.\n\nSometimes, the macro mission won’t be the problem. It’ll be that the chef in you has decided that the mission itself calls for a strategic dot jump. In these cases, jumping dots isn’t a release of persistence but the _stuff_ of persistence. This is the _mission-enhancing_ type of dot jump.\n\nOther times, you’ll feel a darker kind of restlessness—the suspicion that you may need to change up the macro mission. When this happens, you’ll have to figure out if that feeling is emerging from the wise parts of you or simply from your restless, deprioritized yearnings. A _mission-changing_ dot jump may be in order, but depending on which parts of you are asking for it, it may also be the wrong move.\n\nIn these moments, it’s important to consider where you tend to be on this spectrum:\n\n[![](/assets/inertia-spectrum.png)](https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/inertia-spectrum.png)\n\nThe people on the left side of this spectrum are jump-shy. The cement-footed. Their pitfall is staying way too long in the wrong things. The people on the right are jump-happy—the wing-footed—and they have the opposite pitfall: they’re quick quitters.[11](https://waitbutwhy.com/#footnote-11-6721) (You should be especially wary of cement feet—psychologists believe that people at the end of their lives are most likely to regret living by inertia: a commonly voiced regret is [“I wish I had quit earlier,”](https://www.bakadesuyo.com/2012/12/top-career-regrets/) and the most common advice of the elderly is, “[Don’t stay in a job you dislike.](https://www.bakadesuyo.com/2013/04/most-important-life-lesson/)“)\n\nThis is why these internal frameworks are important. They give you the ability to analyze the source of your impulses. In our example, the question is whether your impulse to jump missions is the result of genuine evolution or quick-quitter bias. So think about your diagram. Is your restlessness just the expected incessant whining of an octopus still correctly configured? The weariness from a long trudge on what’s still the right path for you? Or have you learned new information about yourself or the world during the trudge that has corrected some off-base initial assumptions? Or maybe something is fundamentally evolving—some blue or yellow _loop_ activity:\n\n[![](/assets/venn-with-loops-small.png)](https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/venn-with-loops-small.png)\n\nIf you feel that things have genuinely changed, you may decide to zoom out even further and think about the big red loop, which deals with fundamentally changing your mission:\n\n[![](/assets/venn-with-big-loop-small.png)](https://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/venn-with-big-loop-small.png)\n\nIf a career is like connecting the dots, we should probably rank “getting wise about dot-jumping” pretty high on our to-do list. The best place to start is by looking at your own past. Studying your own past decisions, with the flashlight of hindsight and accumulated wisdom, is like an athlete studying game tape.\n\nLooking at my own past, I can see a lot of dot jumps (or, while I was still in school, career plan adjustments), and some of them look pretty unwise in retrospect. But the clearer a picture I can see of my past bad decisions and the thought patterns and behavioral habits that built them, the less likely I’ll be to repeat them in the future.\n\nRemembering that you’re kind of dumb is also a critical humbling exercise. The insecurity of humility doesn’t feel very good, and the burden of having to continually invent your own life map is never easy—but insecurity and difficulty are the feelings of driving your own ship. It’s when we feel too good that we run the risk of becoming overconfident, intellectually complacent, and set in our ways. It’s exactly when we think we have life all figured out that we end up losing our way.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nOver the course of your life, your good and bad decisions will collaborate to forge your unique life path. Often on this blog, I’ve written about how irrational our fears can be and how badly they can hold us back. But we should probably embrace the fear of end-of-life regret.\n\nI’ve thankfully never been on anything that felt like a deathbed, but it seems like there’s something about the end of life that lets people see things with clear eyes. It seems like facing death makes all of those voices in your head who aren’t actually you melt away, leaving your little authentic self standing there all alone, in reflection. I think end-of-life regrets may simply be your authentic self thinking about the parts of your life you never got to live—the parts of you that someone else kicked down into your subconscious.\n\nMy own psyche seems to back this up—looking back on my path so far, the mistakes that bother me most are the ones that happened because someone else took the wheel of my head and overruled the quiet, insecure voice of my authentic self—the mistakes that I knew at the time, deep down, were wrong. My goal for the future isn’t to avoid mistakes, it’s for the mistakes I do make to be my own.\n\nThat’s why I went through such an excruciatingly rigorous analysis in this post. I think this is one of those few topics in life that’s worth it. Other voices will never stop fiercely trying to live your life for you—you owe it to that little insecure character in the very center of your consciousness to get this right.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nIf you’re into Wait But Why, sign up for the **Wait But Why email list** and we’ll send you the new posts right when they come out.

But essentially it boils down to building useful tools for your internal customers.\n\nDevOps as a career can be rewarding in many ways. First, there’s the [average salary of $105,000](https://www.glassdoor.com/Salaries/devops-engineer-salary-SRCH_KO0,15.htm) to [$114,000](https://www.ziprecruiter.com/Salaries/What-Is-the-Average-Devops-Engineer-Salary-by-State), spiking to over $160,000 at the top end. Then there’s the swift job growth, estimated at over 20% per decade, with over [118,000 openings listed on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/devops-jobs) right now.\n\nPlus, DevOps beats the daily grind of “same old, same old,” thanks to its fast-paced, system-support setup. In this article, we share how to become a DevOps engineer — the systems administrator who just happens to be a coder that develops internal tools as well. You’ll learn about the mindset, tools, and skills you’ll need to master, and also how to get a DevOps job.\n\nBefore you start though, is DevOps the right choice for you? See our guide: [Is it Worth it to Become a DevOps Engineer?](https://spacelift.io/blog/who-is-devops-engineer)\n\n## What is DevOps?\n\nDevOps is a mix of development (Dev) and operations (Ops). Beyond that, it’s all the connected tools and disciplines of both of those business areas that let an organization deliver services and software applications at high speed, so they can better serve their customers.\n\nThe Microsoft-approved definition of DevOps is “the union of people, processes and technology to continually provide value to customers.” Both definitions are open to interpretation, but DevOps centers around writing code that pulls together customers (internal and external), and business processes.\n\nSometimes, DevOps engineering means just “being that go-to employee” who can quickly and efficiently write code to address an engineering issue. In other words, in some organizations, DevOps is the indispensable IT employee who knows how to write effective code.\n\nThe question of how to become a DevOps engineer has a relatively straightforward answer. With that said, you’ll need to bring a few things to the table. First and most important to the DevOps career path is a passion for learning, knowledge, and logic.\n\n## Who can become a DevOps engineer?\n\nDevOps engineers need to be able to read between the lines in their customers’ requirements. They also have to produce software and services that meet those requirements in a usable, testable form. Since development doesn’t happen in a vacuum, you’ll also need leadership and management skills, along with a cool head under pressure.\n\n## It’s not all about tools!\n\nWhen most DevOps hiring managers look for a new employee, they’re more concerned with mindset than with tools. If you’ve got a tech background, you’re willing to learn, and you’re an engineer at heart, you’ve already got the basics of a DevOps career.\n\nDevOps engineers are curious, constantly improving their skillsets, and focused on lifelong learning. So while you can build the core skillset in a few months, your main driver should be on learning, with a goal of providing massive value to your next employer.\n\nLearn to understand systems and processes, and you have the right mindset. That mindset will help you learn how to start a career in DevOps, and more important, how to be a *good* DevOps engineer.\n\n## How long does it take to become a DevOps engineer?\n\nIt takes about six months to become a DevOps engineer, assuming you have some basic Linux admin and networking skills, and that you apply the DevOps engineer learning path outlined below. With that said, that career won’t just happen overnight. The length of time required depends on several factors, including your mindset, your current skill level, and your career position.\n\nWith that caveat, there’s no shortage of free tools and resources you can use to help you on your journey. Some professional DevOps engineering sites even offer free or vastly reduced exams to help you grow and prove your worth.  Let’s dig into how to become a DevOps engineer, starting with the tools and skills.\n\n## What skills will I need?\n\nTo become a DevOps engineer, at the bare minimum you’ll need basic Linux admin and networking skills, plus some scripting fundamentals, along with the following DevOps skills:\n\n### 1\\. Intermediate to advanced Linux skills\n\nIn DevOps, you’re not installing a server once and then logging in every now and then to perform a few admin tasks. You need to understand how to create highly customized Linux images from the ground up, both for VM and container use cases — unless you plan to become a Windows Server DevOps engineer.\n\n### 2\\. Intermediate networking skills\n\nIn DevOps there’s no “network team.” All network resources are software-defined. In other words, networks are part of infrastructure as code. At a bare minimum, you’ll need a solid grasp on the OSI model, IPV4, subnetting, static and stateful firewalling, and DNS. These skills are usually included in advanced cloud certifications.\n\n### 3\\. A commitment to at least one cloud\n\nClouds aren’t merely managed data centers. In order for you to automate workloads in a given cloud (AWS, Azure, GCP, etc.), you need a firm grasp of their specific semantics. You’ll need to know what resources are available, how they’re organized, and what properties they have. \n\n### 4\\. Infrastructure automation\n\nOnce you understand the resources (and their properties) applicable to a cloud, you’re ready to automate their creation using tools such as [Terraform](https://spacelift.io/blog/what-is-terraform) and Ansible.\n\n### 5\\. SDLC, CI/CD pipelines, and scripting\n\nIn DevOps, we deliver infrastructure in a similar way to applications. So — you’ll need to be acquainted with the fundamentals of the software development life cycle (SDLC). This includes versioning strategies using source control code management systems like Git, and CI/CD pipelines such as Jenkins, and CircleCI. Advanced automation tasks may prove difficult through shell scripts alone. You’ll often require more powerful scripting using the likes of Python, Perl, or Ruby. \n\n### 6\\. Container technology\n\nFor legacy workloads you may automate the creation of a VM image. But for new applications you’ll be working with containers. As such, you need to know how to build your own Docker images (Linux skills required!) and deploy them using Kubernetes. FaaS technology like AWS Lambda also uses container technology behind the scenes.\n\n### 7\\. Observability technology\n\nWhile all clouds have monitoring dashboards and standard “telemetry” hooks, most large employers use third party (both commercial and open source) monitoring tools such as Prometheus, DynaTrace, Datadog, or the ELK stack.\n\nBeyond that skills list, tool-building in DevOps requires a fundamental understanding of logic, its application, and how to apply it in a computer-recognizable form. While that may sound a tad scary for the uninitiated, there are several good books that cover programming fundamentals without using any specific language. Here are a couple of my favorites:\n\n-   [Learning Python](https://www.amazon.com/_/dp/1449355730?tag=oreilly20-20) (O’Reilly)\n-   [Learn Windows PowerShell in a month of lunches](https://www.amazon.com/Learn-Windows-PowerShell-Month-Lunches/dp/1617291080) (Jones, Hicks — A personal favourite as I love PowerShell)\n\nNow let’s dig into the nuts and bolts of how to become a DevOps engineer — starting with education.\n\n## What education do I need?\n\nOne of the great things about DevOps is that it’s about what you can do, not what qualifications you have. Some of the best DevOps engineers in the field are self-taught, with little in the way of formal higher education. The biggest requirement is motivation and an interest in DevOps engineering.\n\nWith that said, you’ll have a much easier time both learning DevOps skills and getting a company to hire you if you have a bachelor’s degree in software development, IT, or a related field.\n\n## Don’t take forever to get trained\n\nStart your DevOps engineer roadmap by looking through the skills list above. If you already have some of those skills — great. If not, be honest about the time you’ll need to spend to learn them. But don’t stress about getting everything perfect before you start. If you wait for mastery, you’ll never get a DevOps job.\n\nStart by learning a few of the easy-to-learn skills. If you’re already employed in a non-DevOps job, start working on some DevOps projects now, to build mastery and proof you have the skills. Then make the switch to a full-time DevOps career.\n\nYou may even find that your own company has DevOps openings you could move into. Keep a keen eye on internal and external vacancies alike.\n\n## Here are the DevOps skills you’ll need\n\nLet’s take a deeper look now at how to become a DevOps engineer — the DevOps career path and how to build the skills. We’ll share the reasons each of these tools is important, and how long it’ll take to learn each one. We’ll also point you to some good online classes and certifications.\n\nYou can learn most of these skills on the job — but a word of caution. In the sink-or-swim world of DevOps career growth, different companies have different requirements. There’s no one-size-fits-all approach.\n\n### Foundation knowledge: 4 months\n\nWe’ve put a plus-sign after each of the time frames below, because while you can learn the basics quickly, mastery can take much longer.\n\n![DevOps Foundation Knowledge](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7)![DevOps Foundation Knowledge](inbox/assets/DevOps%20Foundation%20Knowledge.png)\n\n#### 1\\. Intermediate to Advanced Linux and Networking: 1 month+\n\nLinux is the OS and server platform of choice for DevOps engineers in companies of any size. Linux’s open-source nature, small operational footprint, and support from the Likes of Redhat and Ubuntu make it the go-to not only for DevOps, but for tool building in general.  One of the best things about Linux is that you can download it and start using it today.\n\nIf you feel that your Linux skills are rusty, you can get started with the free course offered by [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-linux-in-5-days/). In fact, if you want to learn how to become a DevOps engineer exclusively from Udemy, they have an entire [curriculum of core DevOps classes](https://www.udemy.com/topic/devops/).\n\nIn terms of networking, you’ll get the necessary skills if you do an intermediate cloud certification, such as [AWS Certified Solution Architect](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-solutions-architect-associate/), but it helps if you take a specialized course such as [The Bits and Bytes of Computer Networking](https://www.coursera.org/learn/computer-networking?specialization=google-it-support) on Coursera.\n\n#### 2\\. Advanced Scripting: 2 months+\n\nFirst of all, you’ll always need shell (e.g., bash) scripting skills, because this is the default for Linux and most tools. \n\nFor “advanced” scripting use cases, there are quite a few languages out there, but Python is a good start if you don’t know what scripting language to pick.\n\nYou can [master Python in as little as two months](https://www.coursera.org/articles/how-long-does-it-take-to-learn-python-tips-for-learning#:~:text=In%20general%2C%20it%20takes%20around,can%20take%20months%20or%20years.) with online tutorials from [LearnPython.org](https://www.learnpython.org/). However, you’ll find that many employers also use other languages such as Perl and Ruby as well, so be ready to learn those, if need be.\n\n#### 3\\. Cloud Training and Certification: 1 month+\n\nAWS is the 600lb gorilla in terms of agile cloud providers, and AWS and Linux go together like Strawberries and cream. You’ll need to be fluent in AWS before you can call yourself part of the DevOps community.\n\nThe beauty of AWS and cloud development in general is that you only pay for what you use. That model makes cloud computing ideal for DevOps testing. You can set up an environment quickly, use it for what you need, then pull it down again.\n\nIt’s easy to start using AWS, since there’s a 12-month free version available to anyone who signs up. You can learn professional-grade skill in AWS in [as little as one month](https://openupthecloud.com/how-long-to-learn-aws/), though mastery can take years of continual on-the-job use. Get your [AWS certification here](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/).\n\n#### 4\\. Google Cloud: 1 month+\n\nAzure offers similar employment opportunities to AWS, but what about GCP?\n\nThe Google Cloud Platform (GCP) is smaller than AWS and Azure but it excels particularly in data mining and artificial intelligence (and other deep learning technologies). Google’s DevOps-related offerings are becoming increasingly popular with large companies.\n\nIn the banking industry for example, the Google AI/ML tools are creating new ways of doing business, plus adding fraud detection and usage-pattern tracking. This saves huge amounts of time trying to develop similar tools in-house.\n\nSimilarly, other large companies are using Google’s ML tools to bring massive data sets down to size, drawing business-driving insights from previously unmanageable seas of data.\n\nWant to know more about how to become a DevOps engineer with Google Cloud? You can get your [Google Cloud certification here in three months](https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/training-certifications/get-google-cloud-certified-in-3-months#:~:text=Get%20Google%20Cloud%20Certified%20in%203%20months,-Rochana%20Golani), though you can [learn to develop applications with Google Cloud in as little as one month](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/developing-apps-gcp).\n\n### Skills: 1 month\n\nIt doesn’t take long to learn the DevOps skills you’ll need to succeed in your new career. All these tools are free to use and experiment with. They just require a little time and effort on your part. Let’s look at how long it takes to learn the basic DevOps tools like Terraform, Git, Docker, Jenkins, ECS, and ELK Stack.\n\n![DevOps Skills](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7)![DevOps Skills](inbox/assets/DevOps%20Skills.png)\n\n#### 1\\. Configure: Terraform (and Ansible) — 1 week+\n\nConfiguration management is at the heart of fast software development. Poorly configured tools waste time, while well-configured tools save it.\n\nAs its name implies, Terraform has one purpose in life — to create infrastructure as code in an automated way that speeds up your entire process.\n\nAnsible concerns itself with server-desired state configuration, ensuring that servers are configured to specs. These two technologies are cornerstones of DevOps. Both may seem complex at first, but they’re all based around configuration files written in YAML. \n\nTerraform takes about a week to learn the basics. [Udemy offers a great online class](https://www.udemy.com/course/devops-deployment-automation-terraform-aws-docker/) that bundles AWS, Terraform, and Docker. You can also learn more about Ansible in [DevOps courses from ExitCertified](https://www.exitcertified.com/it-training/topics/devops).\n\n#### 2\\. Version control: Git and GitHub (GitLab) — 20 minutes+\n\nVersion control is key to any DevOps endeavour. It lets DevOps Engineers and their team members create and review code faster, without wasting time sharing endless files and iterations.\n\nGit is a standalone product that by default is used on local machines and networks. This is different from GitHub, which facilitates version control in the cloud, with the overhead managed by GitHub itself. In the world of [infrastructure as code](https://spacelift.io/blog/infrastructure-as-code), version control with products like Git and GitLab are essential.\n\n[GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/) is a complete open-source DevOps platform. It helps users deliver software faster, with collaboration and security all rolled into one. Looking to learn more about how to become a DevOps engineer with Git? You can [learn the basics of Git](https://www.udacity.com/course/version-control-with-git--ud123) in minutes if you’re already a programmer. \n\n#### 3\\. Package: Docker (Lambda) — 3 days+\n\nPackaging is where build management meets release management. It’s where your code and infrastructure come together for deployment.\n\nWithout Docker there would be no DevOps. Docker essentially allows DevOps to run code in small isolated containers. That way, building services and replacing services becomes simpler than updating everything in one go (which is very non-DevOps).\n\nAmazon’s Lambda is an alternative to Docker that many companies use instead. Though it’s best to know both tools, Docker is an excellent starting point. You can learn Docker in just a few days. Udemy offers a solid [beginner’s course online for DevOps](https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-docker/). They also have a [Docker class bundled with Kubernetes](https://www.udemy.com/course/docker-and-kubernetes-the-complete-guide/).\n\n#### 4\\. Deploy: Jenkins (CodeDeploy) — 2 days+\n\nDuring deployment, you’ll take your code from version control to users of your application. Automation is a key component of this step, and Jenkins is the central way to automate.\n\nJenkins allows automation for all manner of tasks, including running build tests and making decisions based on whether code passes or fails the build process. You can also use Jenkins for more mundane purposes, like centralized management of scripts and executing commands via SSH (and other authentication pathways).\n\nIt’s a tool to automate those frequent and boring tasks that computers can do better than even the best DevOps engineer could. Some companies choose CodeDeploy over Jenkins, making it another useful DevOps tool to learn.\n\nYou can learn to use Jenkins in just a few days. Udemy offers a great [Jenkins class online](https://www.udemy.com/course/jenkins-from-zero-to-hero/) for DevOps engineers.\n\n#### 5\\. Run: ECS (Kubernetes) — 1 day\n\nKubernetes is DevOps bread and butter. It starts with Docker and adds extra functionality and tools. For instance, it lets the administrator ensure that several copies of a container image are running. That way, if a single VM or host is lost, the service is still available.\n\nECS and Kubernetes perform valuable services like this in the background. They deliver several automated DevOps tools that allow useful additions to manage containers, and their availability. They also add important items such as introducing role-based access control and more centralized auditing and management functionality.\n\nSee [IBM’s Kubernetes learning path and guide](https://developer.ibm.com/series/kubernetes-learning-path/) for a 13-hour course.\n\n#### 6\\. Monitor: ELK Stack (Prometheus) — 2 days\n\nOnce your new application is up and running, you’ll need a real-time view of its status, infrastructure, and services. To this end, DevOps engineers love ELK.\n\nELK provides all the base components for effective log management and search functionality. It’s Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana — three open source applications offered by the [Elastic](https://www.elastic.co/what-is/elk-stack) company.\n\nELK takes data from multiple sources, and lets you visualize it by using useful charts and graphs. Its rival platform, Prometheus, is just as important for a DevOps engineer to understand. You can learn to use the ELK Stack in just a few days with [Udemy’s 4-star online class](https://www.udemy.com/course/elasticsearch-logstash-kibana-learn-elasticsearch-search-server/).\n\nThose are the basics of how to become a DevOps engineer. Now let’s look into why Git matters so much, and how to get a DevOps job.\n\n## GitHub matters\n\nOne more word on GitHub as a shortcut to starting a career in DevOps. GitHub is essentially the CV of the DevOps world. Any DevOps hiring person will check out your GitHub profile as a very first step and point of contact. Yet it’s easy to learn GitHub and other DevOps tools while you create your virtual CV at the same time.\n\n## How to get a DevOps job in 1 month+\n\nKnowing how to become a DevOps engineer doesn’t stop with skills. The next step in your DevOps engineer career path is getting the job. That sounds daunting, but if you’ve got software development experience, the skills above, and a few DevOps achievements for your resume, you’re well on your way to getting hired.\n\nHere’s how to get into DevOps.\n\n### Rewrite your DevOps resume\n\nThe first step in getting a DevOps job is to rewrite your resume. A DevOps resume doesn’t need to show years of experience. As this excellent [DevOps resume guide](https://zety.com/blog/devops-resume-example) shows, start with a reverse-chronological format. Then in your work history, education, and projects section, list achievements, including:\n\n-   Development tasks from past jobs\n-   Side projects in development, IT, Agile, scripting, or automation\n-   Volunteer work in coding or distribution\n-   Projects in Terraform or other DevOps tools\n-   Linux/Unix projects\n-   Scripting in Python or Ruby\n-   Tasks completed with AWS, Jenkins, Maven, etc.\n\nStart each resume bullet point with an action verb like *developed, wrote, created, built, deployed,* etc. And use numbers to show how many projects, deployments, scripts, tests, containers, and how many customers, team members, etc.\n\nThe more you show DevOps achievements in your history, with measurable details, the higher your chance of getting hired. Knowing how to become a DevOps cloud engineer is all about showing your projects and accomplishments.\n\n### Apply to *lots of* DevOps jobs\n\nFinding a DevOps job is a numbers game. If you apply to three jobs, you won’t hear back from any. If you apply to 50, you’ll get a few responses and *maybe* an interview. Plan to hear back from about one in every 30 applications, and get interviewed by one in every 100.\n\nIn other words? You’ll need to apply to a *lot* of DevOps jobs. Probably something like 300 in a month to get one job (about 14 every weekday). But — you can vastly boost your chance of getting hired if you lean on networking. The easiest way? Start connecting with DevOps engineers on LinkedIn.\n\nThen — *don’t* ask them for a job. Just ask if you can chat with them about their cool career. About 20% will be glad to share their success. You’ll learn tons about how to start a career in DevOps. And surprise surprise — some will even introduce you to their contacts.\n\n### Shun the unicorns\n\nDon’t worry about being front-and-center in a DevOps job at Google, Amazon, or another giant company. Everybody clamors to get hired at those firms, creating stifling competition. Don’t be afraid to pursue a DevOps job at a less glamorous firm. Once you’ve got a little experience under your belt, then you can go unicorn hunting.\n\n### Consider working your way up\n\nIs DevOps a good career for freshers? Not really. Don’t count on landing an entry-level DevOps job. DevOps is, by nature, an advanced position that requires highly skilled candidates. But — don’t let that discourage you. One of the best DevOps career paths is to start as a software developer or IT specialist in a company that also hires DevOps engineers.\n\nIf your current employer doesn’t hire DevOps pros, consider switching to one that does. Don’t stay entry-level for long. Three to six months is plenty. Once you’ve logged that time, commit to applying internally to DevOps positions in your new company. During your entry-level tenure, work to build accomplishments that look good on a DevOps resume.\n\n## Summary\n\nThose are the basics of how to become a DevOps engineer. Though becoming a DevOps engineer takes persistence and passion, it’s not rocket science. Anyone with the drive (and a little time) can follow the DevOps career path, learn the necessary skills in five months, and get a DevOps job in one month. With the right skillset and job search strategy, you can be in your DevOps dream job very soon.\n","n":0.017}}},{"i":564,"$":{"0":{"v":"How I Use Obsidian for Note Taking and Note Making   Personal Knowledge Management Journal","n":0.267},"1":{"v":"\n# [How I Use Obsidian for Note-Taking and Note-Making - Personal Knowledge Management Journal](https://pkmjournal.com/how-i-use-obsidian-for-note-taking-and-note-making-8d7bec2882eb)\n\n![](/assets/138Dnk-Pv3A9z2oiLbaRRdw.jpeg)\n\nPhoto by [Ilya Pavlov](https://unsplash.com/@ilyapavlov?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText) on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/s/photos/mac?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText)\n\nI’ve been tinkering with my Obsidian setup for months now, and it’s finally at a stage where I have something that (nearly) works. In the interest of ‘learning in public’, it felt like a great time to share.\n\n## How Do I Use Obsidian?\n\nObsidian is where I:\n\n- Capture the notes and highlights I make on various forms of input, for example, articles, tweets, academic papers and courses.\n- Process those capture notes to generate ideas.\n- Draft and finalise output, for example, articles, based on my ideas.\n- Journal (my journal consists of a daily note and weekly and annual reviews linked to my goals and other notes in my system.\n\nThis article will focus on note-taking and note-making rather than journalling.\n\n## What’s New?\n\nThe most significant changes are in my folder structure and tagging method. I have introduced a home page to act as a standard operating procedure (for myself) to ensure consistency in my approach. Also, I re-engineered my system to focus on input, action and output.\n\nIncidentally, if you follow me on Twitter, you will be aware of my brief but passionate love affair with the Johnny Decimal system ([here’s the tweet](https://twitter.com/MartineGuernsey/status/1497225156284096521?s=20&t=L2Goq32PwZ_RjKW4v0fvhQ)). While I still think JD’s approach is fantastic for storage organisation (my Google Drive and iCloud are completely JohnnyDecimalised), it is not quite what I need for notes. My notes are a system, not a storage area. From my screenshots below, you will see that I have now moved towards a far shallower hierarchy with comparatively fewer folders.\n\nMany of the changes I have introduced have been influenced by others, particularly [Danny Hatcher](https://www.youtube.com/dannyhatcher) (I watch all of his videos) and Elizabeth Butler (I love her [Calmer Notes](https://gumroad.com/a/500388979/VtAjF) approach). I must also mention my Twitter pal, Constantin, who wrote [a brilliant article](https://constantinluegering.de/johnny-decimal-is-a-great-guy-but-we-are-not-best-friends/) off the back of my original JD love tweet.\n\n## Overarching System\n\nThe diagram below shows my overarching personal knowledge management system.\n\n![](/assets/1b34OrRQ6UDq_9Y-baNGkyg.png)\n\nYou can find links to all of the tools I use on the [Tools](https://www.martineellis.com/tools) page of my website (I update this regularly).\n\n[If you are interested in designing your own PKM system from scratch, take a look at this article](https://martineellis.medium.com/how-to-design-your-own-personal-knowledge-management-system-92b455b97ee4).\n\n## How Does it Work?\n\nHere is a screenshot of my new Home page — this outlines the critical elements of my system. Notice the emphasis on input, output and action (my tags).\n\n![](/assets/10GEmRs0gxitohW32DZ__Ug.png)\n\nI include all input and output tags on my New Input Note and New Output Note templates and delete those that do not apply when the template is loaded.\n\nMy New Input Note template looks like this:\n\n![](/assets/1b1jXP8fpAleSEt3g_vt6Ow.png)\n\nMy New Output Note template looks like this:\n\n![](/assets/17W8tTNu0OZSR9vjlIpYFtQ.png)\n\nCrucially, I have ‘#wip’ and ‘#to-process’ tag searches starred and visible at all times. That way, they stay top of mind and do not get ignored.\n\n![](/assets/1OmeeD9meg9cG7Vc1tplfyQ.png)\n\nAnd that folder structure? Here’s my Obsidian sidebar:\n\n![](/assets/1T-9qZ3s-fn-eyOcYGMFVNw.png)\n\n## Where are the Friction Points?\n\nI have the Capture and Permanent aspects of my systems working well now, but I still capture far more than I create. In other words, there is way too much in the Capture area and not enough in Permanent. The reason for this is that I still have not finessed my Working process — this is when I take what I have captured and work on making it something of my own. That’s what I am developing next.\n\n## What About You?\n\nThat’s it (as of March 2022), but I am sure there will be an update soon. Leave me a comment if you have questions or would like to grab a copy of any of my templates. Also, I’d love it if you shared your own systems with me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/MartineGuernsey).

Some of this [originally](http://www.quora.com/What-are-some-lesser-known-but-useful-Unix-commands) [appeared](http://www.quora.com/What-are-the-most-useful-Swiss-army-knife-one-liners-on-Unix) on [Quora](http://www.quora.com/What-are-some-time-saving-tips-that-every-Linux-user-should-know), but it has since moved to GitHub, where people more talented than the original author have made numerous improvements. [**Please submit a question**](https://airtable.com/shrzMhx00YiIVAWJg) if you have a question related to the command line. [**Please contribute**](https://github.com/jlevy/the-art-of-command-line/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) if you see an error or something that could be better!\n\n## Meta\n\nScope:\n\n-   This guide is for both beginners and experienced users. The goals are *breadth* (everything important), *specificity* (give concrete examples of the most common case), and *brevity* (avoid things that aren't essential or digressions you can easily look up elsewhere). Every tip is essential in some situation or significantly saves time over alternatives.\n-   This is written for Linux, with the exception of the \"[macOS only](https://github.com/#macos-only)\" and \"[Windows only](https://github.com/#windows-only)\" sections. Many of the other items apply or can be installed on other Unices or macOS (or even Cygwin).\n-   The focus is on interactive Bash, though many tips apply to other shells and to general Bash scripting.\n-   It includes both \"standard\" Unix commands as well as ones that require special package installs -- so long as they are important enough to merit inclusion.\n\nNotes:\n\n-   To keep this to one page, content is implicitly included by reference. You're smart enough to look up more detail elsewhere once you know the idea or command to Google. Use `apt`, `yum`, `dnf`, `pacman`, `pip` or `brew` (as appropriate) to install new programs.\n-   Use [Explainshell](http://explainshell.com/) to get a helpful breakdown of what commands, options, pipes etc. do.\n\n## Basics\n\n-   Learn basic Bash. Actually, type `man bash` and at least skim the whole thing; it's pretty easy to follow and not that long. Alternate shells can be nice, but Bash is powerful and always available (learning *only* zsh, fish, etc., while tempting on your own laptop, restricts you in many situations, such as using existing servers).\n    \n-   Learn at least one text-based editor well. The `nano` editor is one of the simplest for basic editing (opening, editing, saving, searching). However, for the power user in a text terminal, there is no substitute for Vim (`vi`), the hard-to-learn but venerable, fast, and full-featured editor. Many people also use the classic Emacs, particularly for larger editing tasks. (Of course, any modern software developer working on an extensive project is unlikely to use only a pure text-based editor and should also be familiar with modern graphical IDEs and tools.)\n    \n-   Finding documentation:\n    \n    -   Know how to read official documentation with `man` (for the inquisitive, `man man` lists the section numbers, e.g. 1 is \"regular\" commands, 5 is files/conventions, and 8 are for administration). Find man pages with `apropos`.\n    -   Know that some commands are not executables, but Bash builtins, and that you can get help on them with `help` and `help -d`. You can find out whether a command is an executable, shell builtin or an alias by using `type command`.\n    -   `curl cheat.sh/command` will give a brief \"cheat sheet\" with common examples of how to use a shell command.\n-   Learn about redirection of output and input using `>` and `<` and pipes using `|`. Know `>` overwrites the output file and `>>` appends. Learn about stdout and stderr.\n    \n-   Learn about file glob expansion with `*` (and perhaps `?` and `[`...`]`) and quoting and the difference between double `\"` and single `'` quotes. (See more on variable expansion below.)\n    \n-   Be familiar with Bash job management: `&`, **ctrl-z**, **ctrl-c**, `jobs`, `fg`, `bg`, `kill`, etc.\n    \n-   Know `ssh`, and the basics of passwordless authentication, via `ssh-agent`, `ssh-add`, etc.\n    \n-   Basic file management: `ls` and `ls -l` (in particular, learn what every column in `ls -l` means), `less`, `head`, `tail` and `tail -f` (or even better, `less +F`), `ln` and `ln -s` (learn the differences and advantages of hard versus soft links), `chown`, `chmod`, `du` (for a quick summary of disk usage: `du -hs *`). For filesystem management, `df`, `mount`, `fdisk`, `mkfs`, `lsblk`. Learn what an inode is (`ls -i` or `df -i`).\n    \n-   Basic network management: `ip` or `ifconfig`, `dig`, `traceroute`, `route`.\n    \n-   Learn and use a version control management system, such as `git`.\n    \n-   Know regular expressions well, and the various flags to `grep`/`egrep`. The `-i`, `-o`, `-v`, `-A`, `-B`, and `-C` options are worth knowing.\n    \n-   Learn to use `apt-get`, `yum`, `dnf` or `pacman` (depending on distro) to find and install packages. And make sure you have `pip` to install Python-based command-line tools (a few below are easiest to install via `pip`).\n    \n\n## Everyday use\n\n-   In Bash, use **Tab** to complete arguments or list all available commands and **ctrl-r** to search through command history (after pressing, type to search, press **ctrl-r** repeatedly to cycle through more matches, press **Enter** to execute the found command, or hit the right arrow to put the result in the current line to allow editing).\n    \n-   In Bash, use **ctrl-w** to delete the last word, and **ctrl-u** to delete the content from current cursor back to the start of the line. Use **alt-b** and **alt-f** to move by word, **ctrl-a** to move cursor to beginning of line, **ctrl-e** to move cursor to end of line, **ctrl-k** to kill to the end of the line, **ctrl-l** to clear the screen. See `man readline` for all the default keybindings in Bash. There are a lot. For example **alt-.** cycles through previous arguments, and **alt-**\\* expands a glob.\n    \n-   Alternatively, if you love vi-style key-bindings, use `set -o vi` (and `set -o emacs` to put it back).\n    \n-   For editing long commands, after setting your editor (for example `export EDITOR=vim`), **ctrl-x** **ctrl-e** will open the current command in an editor for multi-line editing. Or in vi style, **escape-v**.\n    \n-   To see recent commands, use `history`. Follow with `!n` (where `n` is the command number) to execute again. There are also many abbreviations you can use, the most useful probably being `!---\ntags:\n  - articles\n---\n\n# [GitHub - jlevy/the-art-of-command-line: Master the command line, in one page](https://github.com/jlevy/the-art-of-command-line)\n\n for last argument and `!!` for last command (see \"HISTORY EXPANSION\" in the man page). However, these are often easily replaced with **ctrl-r** and **alt-.**.\n    \n-   Go to your home directory with `cd`. Access files relative to your home directory with the `~` prefix (e.g. `~/.bashrc`). In `sh` scripts refer to the home directory as `$HOME`.\n    \n-   To go back to the previous working directory: `cd -`.\n    \n-   If you are halfway through typing a command but change your mind, hit **alt-#** to add a `#` at the beginning and enter it as a comment (or use **ctrl-a**, **#**, **enter**). You can then return to it later via command history.\n    \n-   Use `xargs` (or `parallel`). It's very powerful. Note you can control how many items execute per line (`-L`) as well as parallelism (`-P`). If you're not sure if it'll do the right thing, use `xargs echo` first. Also, `-I{}` is handy. Examples:\n    \n\n      find . -name '\\*.py' | xargs grep some\\_function\n      cat hosts | xargs -I{} ssh root@{} hostname\n\n-   `pstree -p` is a helpful display of the process tree.\n    \n-   Use `pgrep` and `pkill` to find or signal processes by name (`-f` is helpful).\n    \n-   Know the various signals you can send processes. For example, to suspend a process, use `kill -STOP [pid]`. For the full list, see `man 7 signal`\n    \n-   Use `nohup` or `disown` if you want a background process to keep running forever.\n    \n-   Check what processes are listening via `netstat -lntp` or `ss -plat` (for TCP; add `-u` for UDP) or `lsof -iTCP -sTCP:LISTEN -P -n` (which also works on macOS).\n    \n-   See also `lsof` and `fuser` for open sockets and files.\n    \n-   See `uptime` or `w` to know how long the system has been running.\n    \n-   Use `alias` to create shortcuts for commonly used commands. For example, `alias ll='ls -latr'` creates a new alias `ll`.\n    \n-   Save aliases, shell settings, and functions you commonly use in `~/.bashrc`, and [arrange for login shells to source it](http://superuser.com/a/183980/7106). This will make your setup available in all your shell sessions.\n    \n-   Put the settings of environment variables as well as commands that should be executed when you login in `~/.bash_profile`. Separate configuration will be needed for shells you launch from graphical environment logins and `cron` jobs.\n    \n-   Synchronize your configuration files (e.g. `.bashrc` and `.bash_profile`) among various computers with Git.\n    \n-   Understand that care is needed when variables and filenames include whitespace. Surround your Bash variables with quotes, e.g. `\"$FOO\"`. Prefer the `-0` or `-print0` options to enable null characters to delimit filenames, e.g. `locate -0 pattern | xargs -0 ls -al` or `find / -print0 -type d | xargs -0 ls -al`. To iterate on filenames containing whitespace in a for loop, set your IFS to be a newline only using `IFS=\\n'`.\n    \n-   In Bash scripts, use `set -x` (or the variant `set -v`, which logs raw input, including unexpanded variables and comments) for debugging output. Use strict modes unless you have a good reason not to: Use `set -e` to abort on errors (nonzero exit code). Use `set -u` to detect unset variable usages. Consider `set -o pipefail` too, to abort on errors within pipes (though read up on it more if you do, as this topic is a bit subtle). For more involved scripts, also use `trap` on EXIT or ERR. A useful habit is to start a script like this, which will make it detect and abort on common errors and print a message:\n    \n\n      set -euo pipefail\n      trap \"echo 'error: Script failed: see failed command above'\" ERR\n\n-   In Bash scripts, subshells (written with parentheses) are convenient ways to group commands. A common example is to temporarily move to a different working directory, e.g.\n\n      # do something in current dir\n      (cd /some/other/dir && other-command)\n      # continue in original dir\n\n-   In Bash, note there are lots of kinds of variable expansion. Checking a variable exists: `${name:?error message}`. For example, if a Bash script requires a single argument, just write `input_file=${1:?usage: $0 input_file}`. Using a default value if a variable is empty: `${name:-default}`. If you want to have an additional (optional) parameter added to the previous example, you can use something like `output_file=${2:-logfile}`. If `$2` is omitted and thus empty, `output_file` will be set to `logfile`. Arithmetic expansion: `i=$(( (i + 1) % 5 ))`. Sequences: `{1..10}`. Trimming of strings: `${var%suffix}` and `${var#prefix}`. For example if `var=foo.pdf`, then `echo ${var%.pdf}.txt` prints `foo.txt`.\n    \n-   Brace expansion using `{`...`}` can reduce having to re-type similar text and automate combinations of items. This is helpful in examples like `mv foo.{txt,pdf} some-dir` (which moves both files), `cp somefile{,.bak}` (which expands to `cp somefile somefile.bak`) or `mkdir -p test-{a,b,c}/subtest-{1,2,3}` (which expands all possible combinations and creates a directory tree). Brace expansion is performed before any other expansion.\n    \n-   The order of expansions is: brace expansion; tilde expansion, parameter and variable expansion, arithmetic expansion, and command substitution (done in a left-to-right fashion); word splitting; and filename expansion. (For example, a range like `{1..20}` cannot be expressed with variables using `{$a..$b}`. Use `seq` or a `for` loop instead, e.g., `seq $a $b` or `for((i=a; i<=b; i++)); do ... ; done`.)\n    \n-   The output of a command can be treated like a file via `<(some command)` (known as process substitution). For example, compare local `/etc/hosts` with a remote one:\n    \n\n      diff /etc/hosts <(ssh somehost cat /etc/hosts)\n\n-   When writing scripts you may want to put all of your code in curly braces. If the closing brace is missing, your script will be prevented from executing due to a syntax error. This makes sense when your script is going to be downloaded from the web, since it prevents partially downloaded scripts from executing:\n\n-   A \"here document\" allows [redirection of multiple lines of input](https://www.tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/here-docs.html) as if from a file:\n\n```\ncat <<EOF\ninput\non multiple lines\nEOF\n```\n\n-   In Bash, redirect both standard output and standard error via: `some-command >logfile 2>&1` or `some-command &>logfile`. Often, to ensure a command does not leave an open file handle to standard input, tying it to the terminal you are in, it is also good practice to add `</dev/null`.\n    \n-   Use `man ascii` for a good ASCII table, with hex and decimal values. For general encoding info, `man unicode`, `man utf-8`, and `man latin1` are helpful.\n    \n-   Use `screen` or [`tmux`](https://tmux.github.io/) to multiplex the screen, especially useful on remote ssh sessions and to detach and re-attach to a session. `byobu` can enhance screen or tmux by providing more information and easier management. A more minimal alternative for session persistence only is [`dtach`](https://github.com/bogner/dtach).\n    \n-   In ssh, knowing how to port tunnel with `-L` or `-D` (and occasionally `-R`) is useful, e.g. to access web sites from a remote server.\n    \n-   It can be useful to make a few optimizations to your ssh configuration; for example, this `~/.ssh/config` contains settings to avoid dropped connections in certain network environments, uses compression (which is helpful with scp over low-bandwidth connections), and multiplex channels to the same server with a local control file:\n    \n\n```\n      TCPKeepAlive=yes\n      ServerAliveInterval=15\n      ServerAliveCountMax=6\n      Compression=yes\n      ControlMaster auto\n      ControlPath /tmp/%r@%h:%p\n      ControlPersist yes\n```\n\n-   A few other options relevant to ssh are security sensitive and should be enabled with care, e.g. per subnet or host or in trusted networks: `StrictHostKeyChecking=no`, `ForwardAgent=yes`\n    \n-   Consider [`mosh`](https://mosh.mit.edu/) an alternative to ssh that uses UDP, avoiding dropped connections and adding convenience on the road (requires server-side setup).\n    \n-   To get the permissions on a file in octal form, which is useful for system configuration but not available in `ls` and easy to bungle, use something like\n    \n\n      stat -c '%A %a %n' /etc/timezone\n\n-   For interactive selection of values from the output of another command, use [`percol`](https://github.com/mooz/percol) or [`fzf`](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf).\n    \n-   For interaction with files based on the output of another command (like `git`), use `fpp` ([PathPicker](https://github.com/facebook/PathPicker)).\n    \n-   For a simple web server for all files in the current directory (and subdirs), available to anyone on your network, use: `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 7777` (for port 7777 and Python 2) and `python -m http.server 7777` (for port 7777 and Python 3).\n    \n-   For running a command as another user, use `sudo`. Defaults to running as root; use `-u` to specify another user. Use `-i` to login as that user (you will be asked for *your* password).\n    \n-   For switching the shell to another user, use `su username` or `su - username`. The latter with \"-\" gets an environment as if another user just logged in. Omitting the username defaults to root. You will be asked for the password *of the user you are switching to*.\n    \n-   Know about the [128K limit](https://wiki.debian.org/CommonErrorMessages/ArgumentListTooLong) on command lines. This \"Argument list too long\" error is common when wildcard matching large numbers of files. (When this happens alternatives like `find` and `xargs` may help.)\n    \n-   For a basic calculator (and of course access to Python in general), use the `python` interpreter. For example,\n    \n\n## Processing files and data\n\n-   To locate a file by name in the current directory, `find . -iname '*something*'` (or similar). To find a file anywhere by name, use `locate something` (but bear in mind `updatedb` may not have indexed recently created files).\n    \n-   For general searching through source or data files, there are several options more advanced or faster than `grep -r`, including (in rough order from older to newer) [`ack`](https://github.com/beyondgrep/ack2), [`ag`](https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher) (\"the silver searcher\"), and [`rg`](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep) (ripgrep).\n    \n-   To convert HTML to text: `lynx -dump -stdin`\n    \n-   For Markdown, HTML, and all kinds of document conversion, try [`pandoc`](http://pandoc.org/). For example, to convert a Markdown document to Word format: `pandoc README.md --from markdown --to docx -o temp.docx`\n    \n-   If you must handle XML, `xmlstarlet` is old but good.\n    \n-   For JSON, use [`jq`](http://stedolan.github.io/jq/). For interactive use, also see [`jid`](https://github.com/simeji/jid) and [`jiq`](https://github.com/fiatjaf/jiq).\n    \n-   For YAML, use [`shyaml`](https://github.com/0k/shyaml).\n    \n-   For Excel or CSV files, [csvkit](https://github.com/onyxfish/csvkit) provides `in2csv`, `csvcut`, `csvjoin`, `csvgrep`, etc.\n    \n-   For Amazon S3, [`s3cmd`](https://github.com/s3tools/s3cmd) is convenient and [`s4cmd`](https://github.com/bloomreach/s4cmd) is faster. Amazon's [`aws`](https://github.com/aws/aws-cli) and the improved [`saws`](https://github.com/donnemartin/saws) are essential for other AWS-related tasks.\n    \n-   Know about `sort` and `uniq`, including uniq's `-u` and `-d` options -- see one-liners below. See also `comm`.\n    \n-   Know about `cut`, `paste`, and `join` to manipulate text files. Many people use `cut` but forget about `join`.\n    \n-   Know about `wc` to count newlines (`-l`), characters (`-m`), words (`-w`) and bytes (`-c`).\n    \n-   Know about `tee` to copy from stdin to a file and also to stdout, as in `ls -al | tee file.txt`.\n    \n-   For more complex calculations, including grouping, reversing fields, and statistical calculations, consider [`datamash`](https://www.gnu.org/software/datamash/).\n    \n-   Know that locale affects a lot of command line tools in subtle ways, including sorting order (collation) and performance. Most Linux installations will set `LANG` or other locale variables to a local setting like US English. But be aware sorting will change if you change locale. And know i18n routines can make sort or other commands run *many times* slower. In some situations (such as the set operations or uniqueness operations below) you can safely ignore slow i18n routines entirely and use traditional byte-based sort order, using `export LC_ALL=C`.\n    \n-   You can set a specific command's environment by prefixing its invocation with the environment variable settings, as in `TZ=Pacific/Fiji date`.\n    \n-   Know basic `awk` and `sed` for simple data munging. See [One-liners](https://github.com/#one-liners) for examples.\n    \n-   To replace all occurrences of a string in place, in one or more files:\n    \n\n      perl -pi.bak -e 's/old-string/new-string/g' my-files-\\*.txt\n\n-   To rename multiple files and/or search and replace within files, try [`repren`](https://github.com/jlevy/repren). (In some cases the `rename` command also allows multiple renames, but be careful as its functionality is not the same on all Linux distributions.)\n\n      # Full rename of filenames, directories, and contents foo -> bar:\n      repren --full --preserve-case --from foo --to bar .\n      # Recover backup files whatever.bak -> whatever:\n      repren --renames --from '(.\\*)\\\\.bak' --to '\\\\1' \\*.bak\n      # Same as above, using rename, if available:\n      rename 's/\\\\.bak$//' \\*.bak\n\n-   As the man page says, `rsync` really is a fast and extraordinarily versatile file copying tool. It's known for synchronizing between machines but is equally useful locally. When security restrictions allow, using `rsync` instead of `scp` allows recovery of a transfer without restarting from scratch. It also is among the [fastest ways](https://web.archive.org/web/20130929001850/http://linuxnote.net/jianingy/en/linux/a-fast-way-to-remove-huge-number-of-files.html) to delete large numbers of files:\n\nmkdir empty && rsync -r --delete empty/ some-dir && rmdir some-dir\n\n-   For monitoring progress when processing files, use [`pv`](http://www.ivarch.com/programs/pv.shtml), [`pycp`](https://github.com/dmerejkowsky/pycp), [`pmonitor`](https://github.com/dspinellis/pmonitor), [`progress`](https://github.com/Xfennec/progress), `rsync --progress`, or, for block-level copying, `dd status=progress`.\n    \n-   Use `shuf` to shuffle or select random lines from a file.\n    \n-   Know `sort`'s options. For numbers, use `-n`, or `-h` for handling human-readable numbers (e.g. from `du -h`). Know how keys work (`-t` and `-k`). In particular, watch out that you need to write `-k1,1` to sort by only the first field; `-k1` means sort according to the whole line. Stable sort (`sort -s`) can be useful. For example, to sort first by field 2, then secondarily by field 1, you can use `sort -k1,1 | sort -s -k2,2`.\n    \n-   If you ever need to write a tab literal in a command line in Bash (e.g. for the -t argument to sort), press **ctrl-v** **\\[Tab\\]** or write `\\t'` (the latter is better as you can copy/paste it).\n    \n-   The standard tools for patching source code are `diff` and `patch`. See also `diffstat` for summary statistics of a diff and `sdiff` for a side-by-side diff. Note `diff -r` works for entire directories. Use `diff -r tree1 tree2 | diffstat` for a summary of changes. Use `vimdiff` to compare and edit files.\n    \n-   For binary files, use `hd`, `hexdump` or `xxd` for simple hex dumps and `bvi`, `hexedit` or `biew` for binary editing.\n    \n-   Also for binary files, `strings` (plus `grep`, etc.) lets you find bits of text.\n    \n-   For binary diffs (delta compression), use `xdelta3`.\n    \n-   To convert text encodings, try `iconv`. Or `uconv` for more advanced use; it supports some advanced Unicode things. For example:\n    \n\n      # Displays hex codes or actual names of characters (useful for debugging):\n      uconv -f utf-8 -t utf-8 -x '::Any-Hex;' < input.txt\n      uconv -f utf-8 -t utf-8 -x '::Any-Name;' < input.txt\n      # Lowercase and removes all accents (by expanding and dropping them):\n      uconv -f utf-8 -t utf-8 -x '::Any-Lower; ::Any-NFD; \\[:Nonspacing Mark:\\] >; ::Any-NFC;' < input.txt \\> output.txt\n\n-   To split files into pieces, see `split` (to split by size) and `csplit` (to split by a pattern).\n    \n-   Date and time: To get the current date and time in the helpful [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) format, use `date -u +\"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ\"` (other options [are](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7216358/date-command-on-os-x-doesnt-have-iso-8601-i-option) [problematic](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/164826/date-command-iso-8601-option)). To manipulate date and time expressions, use `dateadd`, `datediff`, `strptime` etc. from [`dateutils`](http://www.fresse.org/dateutils/).\n    \n-   Use `zless`, `zmore`, `zcat`, and `zgrep` to operate on compressed files.\n    \n-   File attributes are settable via `chattr` and offer a lower-level alternative to file permissions. For example, to protect against accidental file deletion the immutable flag: `sudo chattr +i /critical/directory/or/file`\n    \n-   Use `getfacl` and `setfacl` to save and restore file permissions. For example:\n    \n\n   getfacl -R /some/path \\> permissions.txt\n   setfacl --restore=permissions.txt\n\n-   To create empty files quickly, use `truncate` (creates [sparse file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparse_file)), `fallocate` (ext4, xfs, btrfs and ocfs2 filesystems), `xfs_mkfile` (almost any filesystems, comes in xfsprogs package), `mkfile` (for Unix-like systems like Solaris, Mac OS).\n\n## System debugging\n\n-   For web debugging, `curl` and `curl -I` are handy, or their `wget` equivalents, or the more modern [`httpie`](https://github.com/jkbrzt/httpie).\n    \n-   To know current cpu/disk status, the classic tools are `top` (or the better `htop`), `iostat`, and `iotop`. Use `iostat -mxz 15` for basic CPU and detailed per-partition disk stats and performance insight.\n    \n-   For network connection details, use `netstat` and `ss`.\n    \n-   For a quick overview of what's happening on a system, `dstat` is especially useful. For broadest overview with details, use [`glances`](https://github.com/nicolargo/glances).\n    \n-   To know memory status, run and understand the output of `free` and `vmstat`. In particular, be aware the \"cached\" value is memory held by the Linux kernel as file cache, so effectively counts toward the \"free\" value.\n    \n-   Java system debugging is a different kettle of fish, but a simple trick on Oracle's and some other JVMs is that you can run `kill -3 <pid>` and a full stack trace and heap summary (including generational garbage collection details, which can be highly informative) will be dumped to stderr/logs. The JDK's `jps`, `jstat`, `jstack`, `jmap` are useful. [SJK tools](https://github.com/aragozin/jvm-tools) are more advanced.\n    \n-   Use [`mtr`](http://www.bitwizard.nl/mtr/) as a better traceroute, to identify network issues.\n    \n-   For looking at why a disk is full, [`ncdu`](https://dev.yorhel.nl/ncdu) saves time over the usual commands like `du -sh *`.\n    \n-   To find which socket or process is using bandwidth, try [`iftop`](http://www.ex-parrot.com/~pdw/iftop/) or [`nethogs`](https://github.com/raboof/nethogs).\n    \n-   The `ab` tool (comes with Apache) is helpful for quick-and-dirty checking of web server performance. For more complex load testing, try `siege`.\n    \n-   For more serious network debugging, [`wireshark`](https://wireshark.org/), [`tshark`](https://www.wireshark.org/docs/wsug_html_chunked/AppToolstshark.html), or [`ngrep`](http://ngrep.sourceforge.net/).\n    \n-   Know about `strace` and `ltrace`. These can be helpful if a program is failing, hanging, or crashing, and you don't know why, or if you want to get a general idea of performance. Note the profiling option (`-c`), and the ability to attach to a running process (`-p`). Use trace child option (`-f`) to avoid missing important calls.\n    \n-   Know about `ldd` to check shared libraries etc — but [never run it on untrusted files](http://www.catonmat.net/blog/ldd-arbitrary-code-execution/).\n    \n-   Know how to connect to a running process with `gdb` and get its stack traces.\n    \n-   Use `/proc`. It's amazingly helpful sometimes when debugging live problems. Examples: `/proc/cpuinfo`, `/proc/meminfo`, `/proc/cmdline`, `/proc/xxx/cwd`, `/proc/xxx/exe`, `/proc/xxx/fd/`, `/proc/xxx/smaps` (where `xxx` is the process id or pid).\n    \n-   When debugging why something went wrong in the past, [`sar`](http://sebastien.godard.pagesperso-orange.fr/) can be very helpful. It shows historic statistics on CPU, memory, network, etc.\n    \n-   For deeper systems and performance analyses, look at `stap` ([SystemTap](https://sourceware.org/systemtap/wiki)), [`perf`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perf_%28Linux%29), and [`sysdig`](https://github.com/draios/sysdig).\n    \n-   Check what OS you're on with `uname` or `uname -a` (general Unix/kernel info) or `lsb_release -a` (Linux distro info).\n    \n-   Use `dmesg` whenever something's acting really funny (it could be hardware or driver issues).\n    \n-   If you delete a file and it doesn't free up expected disk space as reported by `du`, check whether the file is in use by a process: `lsof | grep deleted | grep \"filename-of-my-big-file\"`\n    \n\n## One-liners\n\nA few examples of piecing together commands:\n\n-   It is remarkably helpful sometimes that you can do set intersection, union, and difference of text files via `sort`/`uniq`. Suppose `a` and `b` are text files that are already uniqued. This is fast, and works on files of arbitrary size, up to many gigabytes. (Sort is not limited by memory, though you may need to use the `-T` option if `/tmp` is on a small root partition.) See also the note about `LC_ALL` above and `sort`'s `-u` option (left out for clarity below).\n\n      sort a b | uniq \\> c   # c is a union b\n      sort a b | uniq -d \\> c   # c is a intersect b\n      sort a b b | uniq -u \\> c   # c is set difference a - b\n\n-   Pretty-print two JSON files, normalizing their syntax, then coloring and paginating the result:\n\n```\n      diff <(jq --sort-keys . < file1.json) <(jq --sort-keys . < file2.json) | colordiff | less -R\n```\n\n-   Use `grep . *` to quickly examine the contents of all files in a directory (so each line is paired with the filename), or `head -100 *` (so each file has a heading). This can be useful for directories filled with config settings like those in `/sys`, `/proc`, `/etc`.\n    \n-   Summing all numbers in the third column of a text file (this is probably 3X faster and 3X less code than equivalent Python):\n    \n\n      awk '{ x += $3 } END { print x }' myfile\n\n-   To see sizes/dates on a tree of files, this is like a recursive `ls -l` but is easier to read than `ls -lR`:\n\n-   Say you have a text file, like a web server log, and a certain value that appears on some lines, such as an `acct_id` parameter that is present in the URL. If you want a tally of how many requests for each `acct_id`:\n\n      egrep -o 'acct\\_id=\\[0-9\\]+' access.log | cut -d= -f2 | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn\n\n-   To continuously monitor changes, use `watch`, e.g. check changes to files in a directory with `watch -d -n 2 'ls -rtlh | tail'` or to network settings while troubleshooting your wifi settings with `watch -d -n 2 ifconfig`.\n    \n-   Run this function to get a random tip from this document (parses Markdown and extracts an item):\n    \n\n      function taocl() {\n        curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jlevy/the-art-of-command-line/master/README.md |\n          sed '/cowsay\\[.\\]png/d' |\n          pandoc -f markdown -t html |\n          xmlstarlet fo --html --dropdtd |\n          xmlstarlet sel -t -v \"(html/body/ul/li\\[count(p)>0\\])\\[$RANDOM mod last()+1\\]\" |\n          xmlstarlet unesc | fmt -80 | iconv -t US\n      }\n\n## Obscure but useful\n\n-   `expr`: perform arithmetic or boolean operations or evaluate regular expressions\n    \n-   `m4`: simple macro processor\n    \n-   `yes`: print a string a lot\n    \n-   `cal`: nice calendar\n    \n-   `env`: run a command (useful in scripts)\n    \n-   `printenv`: print out environment variables (useful in debugging and scripts)\n    \n-   `look`: find English words (or lines in a file) beginning with a string\n    \n-   `cut`, `paste` and `join`: data manipulation\n    \n-   `fmt`: format text paragraphs\n    \n-   `pr`: format text into pages/columns\n    \n-   `fold`: wrap lines of text\n    \n-   `column`: format text fields into aligned, fixed-width columns or tables\n    \n-   `expand` and `unexpand`: convert between tabs and spaces\n    \n-   `nl`: add line numbers\n    \n-   `seq`: print numbers\n    \n-   `bc`: calculator\n    \n-   `factor`: factor integers\n    \n-   [`gpg`](https://gnupg.org/): encrypt and sign files\n    \n-   `toe`: table of terminfo entries\n    \n-   `nc`: network debugging and data transfer\n    \n-   `socat`: socket relay and tcp port forwarder (similar to `netcat`)\n    \n-   [`slurm`](https://github.com/mattthias/slurm): network traffic visualization\n    \n-   `dd`: moving data between files or devices\n    \n-   `file`: identify type of a file\n    \n-   `tree`: display directories and subdirectories as a nesting tree; like `ls` but recursive\n    \n-   `stat`: file info\n    \n-   `time`: execute and time a command\n    \n-   `timeout`: execute a command for specified amount of time and stop the process when the specified amount of time completes.\n    \n-   `lockfile`: create semaphore file that can only be removed by `rm -f`\n    \n-   `logrotate`: rotate, compress and mail logs.\n    \n-   `watch`: run a command repeatedly, showing results and/or highlighting changes\n    \n-   [`when-changed`](https://github.com/joh/when-changed): runs any command you specify whenever it sees file changed.

Most of the things described in this document will work out of the box.\n    \n-   On Windows 10, you can use [Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)](https://msdn.microsoft.com/commandline/wsl/about), which provides a familiar Bash environment with Unix command line utilities.\n    \n-   If you mainly want to use GNU developer tools (such as GCC) on Windows, consider [MinGW](http://www.mingw.org/) and its [MSYS](http://www.mingw.org/wiki/msys) package, which provides utilities such as bash, gawk, make and grep. MSYS doesn't have all the features compared to Cygwin. MinGW is particularly useful for creating native Windows ports of Unix tools.\n    \n-   Another option to get Unix look and feel under Windows is [Cash](https://github.com/dthree/cash). Note that only very few Unix commands and command-line options are available in this environment.\n    \n\n### Useful Windows command-line tools\n\n-   You can perform and script most Windows system administration tasks from the command line by learning and using `wmic`.\n    \n-   Native command-line Windows networking tools you may find useful include `ping`, `ipconfig`, `tracert`, and `netstat`.\n    \n-   You can perform [many useful Windows tasks](http://www.thewindowsclub.com/rundll32-shortcut-commands-windows) by invoking the `Rundll32` command.\n    \n\n### Cygwin tips and tricks\n\n-   Install additional Unix programs with the Cygwin's package manager.\n    \n-   Use `mintty` as your command-line window.\n    \n-   Access the Windows clipboard through `/dev/clipboard`.\n    \n-   Run `cygstart` to open an arbitrary file through its registered application.\n    \n-   Access the Windows registry with `regtool`.\n    \n-   Note that a `C:\\` Windows drive path becomes `/cygdrive/c` under Cygwin, and that Cygwin's `/` appears under `C:\\cygwin` on Windows. Convert between Cygwin and Windows-style file paths with `cygpath`. This is most useful in scripts that invoke Windows programs.\n    \n\n## More resources\n\n-   [awesome-shell](https://github.com/alebcay/awesome-shell): A curated list of shell tools and resources.\n-   [awesome-osx-command-line](https://github.com/herrbischoff/awesome-osx-command-line): A more in-depth guide for the macOS command line.\n-   [Strict mode](http://redsymbol.net/articles/unofficial-bash-strict-mode/) for writing better shell scripts.\n-   [shellcheck](https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck): A shell script static analysis tool.

He has written from the perspective of a wide variety of disciplines: Literary Criticism, Psychology, Anthropology, Sociology, History, Biblical Hermeneutics and Theology. Although he rarely calls himself a philosopher, many philosophical implications can be derived from his work. Girard’s work is above all concerned with Philosophical Anthropology (that is, ‘What is it to be human?’), and draws from many disciplinary perspectives. Over the years he has developed a mimetic theory. According to this theory human beings imitate each other, and this eventually gives rise to rivalries and violent conflicts. Such conflicts are partially solved by a scapegoat mechanism, but ultimately, Christianity is the best antidote to violence.\n\nPerhaps Girard’s lack of specific disciplinary affiliation has promoted a slight marginalization of his work among contemporary philosophers. Girard is not on par with more well known French contemporary philosophers (for example [Derrida](https://iep.utm.edu/derrida/), [Foucault](https://iep.utm.edu/foucault/), [Deleuze](https://iep.utm.edu/deleuze/), [Lyotard](https://iep.utm.edu/lyotard/)), but his work is becoming increasingly recognized in the humanities, and his commitment as a Christian thinker has given him prominence among theologians.\n\n### Table of Contents\n\n1.

He was the son of a local archivist, and he went on to follow his father’s footsteps. He studied in Paris’ École Nationale des Chartes, and specialized in Medieval studies. In 1947, Girard took the opportunity to emigrate to America, and pursued a doctorate at Indiana University. His dissertation was on Americans’ opinions about France. Although his later work has had little to do with his doctoral dissertation, Girard has kept a live interest in French affairs.\n\nAfter the completion of his doctorate, Girard began to take interest in Jean-Paul Sartre’s work. Although on a personal level Girard is still very much interested in Sartre’s philosophy, it has had little influence on his thought. Girard settled in America, and has taught at different institutions (Indiana University, State University of New York in Buffalo, Duke, Johns Hopkins, Bryn Mawr and Stanford) until his retirement in 1995. He died in 2015.\n\nDuring the beginning of his career as lecturer, Girard was assigned to teach courses on European literature; he admits he was not at all familiar with the great works of European novelists. As Girard began to read the great European novels in preparation for the course, he became especially engaged with the work of five novelists in particular: Cervantes, Stendhal, Flaubert, Dostoyevsky and Proust.\n\nHis first book, *Mensonge Romantique et Vérité Romanesque* (1961), is a literary comment on the works of these great novelists. Until that time, Girard was a self-declared agnostic. As he researched the religious conversions of some of Dostoyevsky’s characters, he felt he had lived a similar experience, and converted to Christianity. Ever since, Girard has been a committed and practicing Roman Catholic.\n\nAfter the publication of his first book, Girard turned his attention to ancient and contemporary sacrifice rituals, as well as Greek myth and tragedy. This led to another important book, *La Violence et le Sacré* (1972), for which he gained much recognition. On a personal level, he was a committed Christian, but his Christian views were not publicly expressed until the publication of *Des Choses Cachées Depuis la Fondation du Monde* (1978), his *magnum opus*, and best systematization of his thought*.* Ever since, Girard has written books that expand various aspects of his work. In 2005, Girard was elected to the *Académie Française*, a very important distinction among French intellectuals.\n\n## 2\\. Mimetic Desire\n\nGirard’s fundamental concept is ‘mimetic desire’. Ever since Plato, students of human nature have highlighted the great mimetic capacity of human beings; that is, we are the species most apt at imitation. Indeed, imitation is the basic mechanism of learning (we learn inasmuch as we imitate what our teachers do), and neuroscientists are increasingly reporting that our neural structure promotes imitation very proficiently (for example, ‘mirror neurons’).\n\nHowever, according to Girard, most thinking devoted to imitation pays little attention to the fact that we also imitate other people’s desires, and depending on how this happens, it may lead to conflicts and rivalries. If people imitate each other’s desires, they may wind up desiring the very same things; and if they desire the same things, they may easily become rivals, as they reach for the same objects. Girard usually distinguishes ‘imitation’ from ‘mimesis’. The former is usually understood as the positive aspect of reproducing someone else’s behavior, whereas the latter usually implies the negative aspect of rivalry. It should also be mentioned that because the former usually is understood to refer to mimicry, Girard proposes the latter term to refer to the deeper, instinctive response that humans have to each other.\n\n### a. External Mediation\n\nGirard calls ‘mediation’ the process in which a person influences the desires and preferences of another person. Thus, whenever a person’s desire is imitated by someone else, she becomes a ‘mediator’ or ‘model’. Girard points out that this is very evident in publicity and marketing techniques: whenever a product is promoted, some celebrity is used to ‘mediate’ consumers’ desires: in a sense, the celebrity is inviting people to imitate him in his desire of the product. The product is not promoted on the basis of its inherent qualities, but simply because of the fact that some celebrity desires it.\n\nIn his studies on literature, Girard highlights this type of relationship in his literary studies, as for example in his study of *Don Quixote.* Don Quixote is mediated by Amadis de Gaula. Don Quixote becomes an errant knight, not really because he autonomously desires so, but in order to imitate Amadis. Nevertheless, Amadis and Don Quixote are characters on different planes. They will never meet, and in such a manner, they never become rivals.\n\nThe same can be said of the relation between Sancho and Don Quixote. Sancho desires to be governor of an island, mostly because Don Quixote has suggested to Sancho that that is what he should desire. Again, although they interact continuously, Sancho and Don Quixote belong to two different worlds: Don Quixote is a very complex man, Sancho is simple in extreme. Girard calls ‘external mediation’ the situation when the mediator and the person mediated are on different planes. Don Quixote is an ‘external mediator’ to Sancho, inasmuch as he mediates his desires ‘from the outside’; that is, Don Quixote never becomes an obstacle in Sancho’s attempts to satisfy his desires.\n\nExternal mediation does not carry the risk of rivalry between subjects, because they belong to different worlds. Although the source of Sancho’s desire to be governor of an island is in fact Don Quixote, they never desire the same object. Don Quixote desires things Sancho does not desire, and vice versa. Hence, they never become rivals. Girard believes ‘external mediation’ is a frequent feature of the psychology of desire: from our earliest phase as infants, we look up in imitation to our elders, and eventually, most of what we desire is mediated by them.\n\n### b. Internal Mediation\n\nIn ‘internal mediation’, the ‘mediator’ and the person mediated are no longer abysmally separated and hence, do not belong to different worlds. In fact, they come to resemble each other to the point that they end up desiring the same things. But, precisely because they are no longer on different worlds and now reach for the same objects of desire, they become rivals. We are fully aware that competition is fiercer when competitors resemble each other.\n\nThus, in internal mediation the subject imitates the model’s desires, but ultimately, unlike external mediation, the subject falls into rivalry with the model/mediator. Consider this example: a toddler imitates his father in his occupations, and he desires to pursue his father’s career when he grows up. This will hardly cause any rivalry (although it may account for Freud’s Oedipus Complex; see section 2.d). This is, as we have seen, a case of external mediation. But, now consider a PhD candidate that learns a great deal from his supervisor, and seeks to imitate every aspect of his work, and even his life. Eventually, they may become rivals, especially if both are looking for scholarly recognition. Or, consider further the case of a toddler that is playing with a toy, and another toddler that, out of imitation, desires that very same toy: they will eventually become rivals for the control of the toy. This is ‘internal mediation’; that is the person is mediated from the ‘inside’ of his world, and therefore, may easily become his mediator’s rival. This rivalry often has tragic consequences, and Girard considers this a major theme in modern novels. In Girard’s view, this literary theme is in fact a portrait of human nature: very often, people will desire something as a result of imitating other people, but eventually, this imitation will lead to rivalries with the very person imitated in the first place.\n\n### c. Metaphysical Desire\n\nIn Girard’s view, mimetic desire may grow to such a degree, that a person may eventually desire to *be* her mediator. Again, publicity is illustrative: sometimes, consumers do not just desire a product for its inherent qualities, but rather, desire to *be* the celebrity that promotes such a product. Girard considers that a person may desire an object only as part of a larger desire; that is, to *be* her mediator. Girard calls the desire to *be* other people, ‘metaphysical desire’. Furthermore, acquisitive desire leads to metaphysical desire, and the original object of desire becomes a token representing the “larger” desire of *having the being of the model/rival*.\n\nWhereas external mediation does not lead to rivalries, internal mediation does lead to rivalries. But, metaphysical desire leads a person not just to rivalry with her mediator; actually, it leads to total obsession with and resentment of the mediator. For, the mediator becomes the main obstacle in the satisfaction of the person’s metaphysical desire. Inasmuch as the person desires to *be* his mediator, such desire will never be satisfied. For nobody can be someone else. Eventually, the person developing a metaphysical desire comes to appreciate that the main obstacle to be the mediator is the mediator himself.\n\nAccording to Girard, metaphysical desire can be a very destructive force, as it promotes resentment against others. Girard considers that the anti-hero of Dostoyevsky’s *Notes From the Underground* is the quintessential victim of metaphysical desire: the unnamed character eventually goes on a crusade against the world, as he is disillusioned with everything around him. Girard believes that the origin of his alienation is his dissatisfaction with himself, and his obsession to be someone else; that is, an impossible task.\n\n### d. The Oedipus Complex\n\nGirard’s career has been mostly devoted to literary criticism, and the analysis of fictional characters. Girard believes that the great modern novelists (such as Stendhal, Flaubert, Proust and Dostoevsky) have understood human psychology better than the modern field of Psychology does. And, as a complement of his literary criticism, he has developed a psychology in which the concept of ‘mimetic desire’ is central. Inasmuch as human beings constantly seek to imitate others, and most desires are in fact borrowed from other people, Girard believes that it is crucial to study how personality relates to others.\n\nDeparting from the main premise of mimetic desire, Girard has sought to reformulate some of psychology’s long-held assumptions. In particular, Girard seeks to reconsider some of [Freud](https://iep.utm.edu/freud/)’s concepts. Although Girard has been careful enough to warn that Freud’s thought may be highly misleading in many ways, he has been engaged with Freud’s work in a number of ways. Girard admits that Freud and his followers had some good initial intuitions, but criticizes Freudian psychoanalytic theory on the grounds that it tends to obviate the role that other individuals have on the development of personality. In other words, psychoanalysis tends to assume that human beings are largely autonomous, and hence, do not desire in imitation of others.\n\nGirard grants that Freud was a superb observer, but was not a good interpreter. And, in a sense, Girard accepts that there is such a thing as the Oedipus Complex: the child will eventually come to unconsciously have a sexual desire for his mother, and a desire to kill his father; and indeed, perhaps this complex will endure throughout adulthood. But, Girard considers that the Oedipus Complex is the result of a mechanism very different from the one outlined by Freud.\n\nAccording to Freud, the child has an innate sexual desire towards the mother, and eventually, discovers that the father is an obstacle to the satisfaction of that desire. Girard, on the other hand, reinterprets the Oedipus Complex in terms of mimetic desire: the child becomes identified with his father and imitates him. But, inasmuch as he imitates his father, the child imitates the sexual desire for his mother. Then, his father becomes his model and rival, and that explains the ambivalent feelings so characteristic of the Oedipus Complex.\n\n## 3\\. The Scapegoat Mechanism\n\nIn Girard’s psychology, internal mediation and metaphysical desire eventually lead to rivalry and violence. Imitation eventually erases the differences among human beings, and inasmuch as people become similar to each other, they desire the same things, which leads to rivalries and a Hobbesian war of all against all. These rivalries soon bear the potential to threaten the very existence of communities. Thus, Girard asks: how is it possible for communities to overcome their internal strife?\n\nWhereas the philosophers of the 18th century would have agreed that communal violence comes to an end due to a social contract, Girard believes that, paradoxically, the problem of violence is frequently solved with a lesser dose of violence. When mimetic rivalries accumulate, tensions grow ever greater. But, that tension eventually reaches a paroxysm. When violence is at the point of threatening the existence of the community, very frequently a bizarre psychosocial mechanism arises: communal violence is all of the sudden projected upon a single individual. Thus, people that were formerly struggling, now unite efforts against someone chosen as a scapegoat. Former enemies now become friends, as they communally participate in the execution of violence against a specified enemy.\n\nGirard calls this process ‘scapegoating’, an allusion to the ancient religious ritual where communal sins were metaphorically imposed upon a he-goat, and this beast was eventually abandoned in the desert, or sacrificed to the gods (in the Hebrew Bible, this is especially prescribed in *Leviticus* 16).The person that receives the communal violence is a ‘scapegoat’ in this sense: her death or expulsion is useful as a regeneration of communal peace and restoration of relationships.\n\nHowever, Girard considers it crucial that this process be unconscious in order to work. The victim must never be recognized as an innocent scapegoat (indeed, Girard considers that, prior to the rise of Christianity, ‘innocent scapegoat’ was virtually an oxymoron; see section 4.b below); rather, the victim must be thought of as a monstrous creature that transgressed some prohibition and deserved to be punished. In such a manner, the community deceives itself into believing that the victim is the culprit of the communal crisis, and that the elimination of the victim will eventually restore peace.\n\n### a. The Origins of Culture\n\nGirard believes that the scapegoat mechanism is the very foundation of cultural life. Natural man became civilized, not through some sort of rational deliberation embodied in a social contract, (as it was fashionable to think among 18th century philosophers) but rather, through the repetition of the scapegoat mechanism. And, very much as many philosophers of the 18th Century believed that their descriptions of the natural state were in fact historical, Girard believes that, indeed, Paleolithic men continually used the scapegoat mechanism, and it was precisely this feature what allowed them to lay the foundations of culture and civilization.\n\nIn fact, Girard believes that this process goes farther back in the evolution of *Homo sapiens*: hominids probably were engaged in scapegoating. But, it was precisely scapegoating what allowed a minimum of communal peace among early hominid groups. Hominids could eventually develop their main cultural traits due to the efficiency of the scapegoat mechanism. The murder of a victim brought forth communal peace, and this peace promoted the flourishing of the most basic cultural institutions.\n\nOnce again, Girard takes deep inspiration from Freud, but reinterprets his observations. Freud’s *Totem and Taboo* presents a thesis that the origins of culture are founded upon the original murder of a father figure by his sons. Girard considers that Freud’s observations were only partially correct. Freud is right in pointing out that indeed, culture is founded upon a murder. But, this murder is not due to the oedipal themes Freud was so fond of. Instead, the founding murder is due to the scapegoat mechanism. The horde murdered a victim (not necessarily a father figure) in order to project upon her all the violence that was threatening the very existence of the community.\n\nHowever, as mimetic desire has been a constant among human beings, scapegoating has never been entirely efficient. Nevertheless, human communities need to periodically recourse to the scapegoating mechanism in order to maintain social peace.\n\n### b. Religion\n\nAccording to Girard, the scapegoat mechanism brings about unexpected peace. But, this moment is so marvelous, that it soon acquires a religious overtone. Thus, the victim is immediately consecrated. Girard is in the French sociological tradition of Durkheim, who considered that religion essentially accomplishes the function of social integration. In Girard’s view, inasmuch as the deceased victim brings forth communal peace and restores social order and integration, she becomes sacred.\n\nAt first, while living, victims are considered to be monstrous transgressors that deserve to be punished. But, once they die, they bring peace to the community. Then, they are not monsters any longer, but rather gods. Girard highlights that, in most primitive societies, there is a deep ambivalence towards deities: they hold high virtues, but they are also capable of performing some very monstrous deeds. That is how, according to Girard, primitive gods are sanctified victims.\n\nIn such a manner, all cultures are founded upon a religious basis. The function of the sacred is to offer protection for the stability of communal peace. And, to do this, it ensures that the scapegoat mechanism provides its effects through the main religious institutions.\n\n### c. Ritual\n\nGirard considers rituals the earliest cultural and religious institution. In Girard’s view, ritual is a reenactment of the original scapegoating murder. Although, as anthropologists are quick to assert, rituals are very diverse, Girard considers that the most popular form of ritual is sacrifice. When a victim is ritually killed, Girard believes, the community is commemorating the original event that promoted peace.\n\nThe original victim was most likely a member of the community. Girard considers that, probably, earliest sacrificial rituals employed human victims. Thus, Aztec human sacrifice may have impacted Western conquistadors and missionaries upon its discovery, but this was a cultural remnant of a popular ancient practice. Eventually, rituals promoted sacrificial substitution, and animals were employed. In fact, Girard considers that hunting and the domestication of animals arose out of the need to continually reenact the original murder with substitute animal victims.\n\n### d. Myth\n\nFollowing the old school of European anthropologists, Girard believes that myths are the narrative corollary of ritual. And, inasmuch as rituals are mainly a reenactment of the original murder, myths also recapitulate the scapegoating themes.\n\nNow, Girard’s crucial point about the necessary unconsciousness of scapegoating: must be kept in mind in order for this mechanism to work, its participants must not recognize it as such. That is to say, the victim must never appear as what it really is: a scapegoat that is no guiltier of disturbance, than other members of the community.\n\nThe way to assure that scapegoats are not recognized as what they really are is by distorting the story of the events that led to their death. This is accomplished by telling the story from the perspective of the scapegoaters. Myths will usually tell a story of someone doing a terrible thing and, thus, deserving to be punished. The victim’s perspective will never be incorporated into the myth, precisely because this would spoil the psychological effect of the scapegoating mechanism. The victim will always be portrayed as a culprit whose deeds brought about social chaos, but whose death or expulsion brought about social peace.\n\nGirard’s most recurrent example of myths is that of Oedipus. According to the myth, Oedipus was expelled from Thebes because he murdered his father and married his mother. But, according to Girard, the myth should be read as a chronicle written by a community that chose a scapegoat, blamed him of some crime, punished him, and once expelled, peace returned. Under Girard’s interpretation, the fact that there was a pest in Thebes is suggestive of a social crisis. To solve the crisis, Oedipus is selected as a scapegoat. But, he is never presented as such: quite the contrary, he is accused of parricide and incest, and this justifies his persecution. Thus, Oedipus’ perspective as a victim is suppressed from the myth.\n\nFurthermore, Girard believes that, as myths evolve, later versions will tend to dissimulate the scapegoating violence (for example, instead of presenting a victim who dies by drowning, the myth will just claim that the victim went to live to the bottom of the sea), in order to avoid feeling compassion for the victim. Indeed, Girard considers that the evolution of myths may even reach a point where no violence is present. But, Girard insists, all myths are founded upon violence, and if no violence is found in a myth, it must be because the community made it disappear.\n\nMyths are typical of archaic societies, but Girard thinks that modern societies have the equivalent of myths: persecution texts. Especially during the witch-hunts and persecution of Jews during the Middle Ages, there were plenty of chronicles written from the perspective of the mobs and witch-hunters. These texts told the story of a crisis that appeared as the consequence of some crime committed by a person or a minority. The author of the chronicle is part of the persecuting mob, as he projects upon the victim all the typical accusations, and justifies the mob’s actions. Modern lynching accounts are another prominent example of such persecutory dynamics.\n\n### e. Prohibitions\n\nInasmuch as, under the scapegoaters’ view, there are no innocent scapegoats, an accusation must be made. In the case of Oedipus, he was accused of parricide and incest, and these are recurrent accusations to justify persecution (for example Maria Antoinette), but many other accusations are found (for example blood libels, witchcraft, and so forth). After the victim is executed, Girard claims, a prohibition falls upon the action allegedly perpetrated by the scapegoat. By doing so, the scapegoaters believe they restore social order. Thus, along with ritual and myths, prohibitions derive from the scapegoat mechanism.\n\nGirard also considers that prior to the scapegoating mechanism, communities go through a process he calls a ‘crisis of differences’. Mimetic desire eventually makes every member resemble each other, and this lack of differentiation generates chaos. Traditionally, this indifferentiation is represented through various symbols typically associated with chaos and disorder (plagues, monstrous animals, and so forth). The death of the scapegoat mechanism restores order and, by extension, differentiation. Thus, everything returns to its place. In such a manner, social differentiation and order in general is also derived from the scapegoat mechanism.\n\n## 4\\. The Uniqueness of the Bible and Christianity\n\nGirard’s Christian apologetics departs from a comparison of myths and the Bible. According to Girard, whereas myths are caught under the dynamics of the scapegoat mechanism by telling the foundational stories from the perspective of the scapegoaters, the Bible contains plenty of stories that tell the story from the perspective of the victims.\n\nIn myths, those who are collectively executed are presented as monstrous culprits that deserve to be punished. In the Bible, those who are collectively executed are presented as innocent victims that are unfairly accused and persecuted. Thus, Girard recapitulates the old Christian apologetic tradition of insisting upon the Bible’s singularity. But, instead of making emphasis on the Bible’s popularity, or fulfillment of prophecies, or consistency, Girard thinks the Bible is unique in its defense of victims.\n\nHowever, according to Girard, this is not merely a shift in narrative perspective. It is in fact something much more profound. Inasmuch as the Bible presents stories from the perspective of the victims, the Biblical authors reveal something not understood by previous mythological traditions. And, by doing so, they make scapegoating inoperative. Once scapegoats are recognized for what they truly are, the scapegoating mechanism no longer works. Thus, the Bible is a remarkably subversive text, inasmuch as it shatters the scapegoating foundations of culture.\n\n### a. The Hebrew Bible\n\nGirard thinks that the Hebrew Bible is a text in travail. There are plenty of stories that are still told from the perspective of the scapegoaters. And, more importantly, it continuously presents a wrathful God that sanctions violence. However, Girard appreciates some important shifts in some narratives from the Bible, especially when they are compared to myths that present similar structures.\n\nFor example, Girard contrasts the story of Cain and Abel with the myth of Remus and Romulus. In both stories, there is rivalry between the brothers. In both stories, there is a murder. But, in the Roman myth, Romulus is justified in killing Remus, as the latter transgressed the territorial limits they had earlier agreed upon. In the Biblical story, Cain is never justified in killing Abel. And, indeed, the blood of Abel is evoked as the blood of the innocent victims that have been murdered throughout history, and that God will vindicate.\n\nGirard is also fond of comparing the story of Oedipus with the story of Joseph. Oedipus is accused of incest, and the myth accepts this accusation, therefore justifying his expulsion from Thebes. Joseph is also accused of incest (he allegedly attempted to rape Potiphar’s wife, his *de facto* step mother). But, the Bible never accepts such an accusation.\n\nIn Girard’s views, the Hebrew Bible is also crucial in its rejection of ritual sacrifice. Some prophets vehemently denounced the grotesque ritual killing of sacrificial victims, although, of course, the ritual requirement of sacrificial rituals permeates much of the Old Testament. Girard understands this as a complementary approach to the defense of victims. The prophets promote a new concept of the divinity: God is no longer pleased with ritual violence. This is evocative of Hosea’s plea from God: “I want mercy, not sacrifices”. Thus, the Hebrew Bible takes a twofold reversal of culture’s violent foundation: on the one hand, it begins to present the foundational stories from the perspective of the victims; on the other hand, it begins to present a God that is not satisfied with violence and, therefore, begins to dissociate the sacred from the violent.\n\n### b. The New Testament\n\nUnder Girard’s interpretation, the New Testament is the completion of the process that the Hebrew Bible had begun. The New Testament fully endorses the victims’ perspective, and satisfactorily dissociates the sacred from the violent.\n\nThe Passion story is central in the New Testament, and it is the complete reversal of traditional myth’s structure. Amidst a huge social crisis, a victim (Jesus) is persecuted, blamed of some fault, and executed. Even the apostles succumb to the collective pressure and abandon Jesus, tacitly becoming part of the scapegoating crowd. This is emblematic in the story of Peter’s denial of Jesus.\n\nNevertheless, the evangelists never succumb to the collective pressure of the scapegoating mob. The evangelists adhere to Jesus’ innocence throughout the whole story. Alas, Jesus is finally recognized as what he really is: an innocent scapegoat, the Lamb of God that was taken to the slaughterhouse, although no fault was in him. According to Girard, this is the completion of a slow process begun in the Hebrew Bible. Once and for all, the New Testament reverses the violent psychosocial mechanism upon which human culture has been founded.\n\nAside from that, Jesus’ ethical message is complementary. Under Girard’s interpretation, humanity has achieved social peace by performing violent acts of scapegoating. Jesus’ solution is much more radical and efficient: to turn the other cheek, to abstain from violent retribution. Scapegoating is not an efficient means to bring about peace, as it always depends on the periodic repetition of the mechanism. The real solution is in the total withdrawal from violence, and that is the bulk of Jesus’ message.\n\n### c. Nietzsche’s Criticism of Christianity\n\nGirard is bothered by the possibility that his readers may fail to appreciate the uniqueness of the Bible and Christianity. In this sense, Girard is very critical of classical anthropologists such as Sir James Frazer, who saw the relevance of scapegoating in primitive rituals and myths, but, according to Girard, failed to see that the Christian story is fundamentally different from other scapegoating myths.\n\nIndeed, Girard resents the fact that Christianity is usually considered to be merely one among many other religions. However, ironically, Girard seeks help from a powerful opponent of Christianity: [Friedrich Nietzsche](https://iep.utm.edu/nietzsch/). Nietzsche criticized Christianity for its ‘slave morality’; that is, its tendency to side with the weak. Nietzsche recognized that, above other religions, Christianity promoted mercy as a virtue. Nietzsche interpreted this as a corruption of the human vital spirit, and advocated a return to the pre-Christian values of power and strength.\n\nGirard is, of course, opposed to the Nietzschean disdain for mercy and antipathy towards the weak and victims. But, Girard considers Nietzsche a genius, inasmuch as the German philosopher saw what, according to Girard, most people (including the majority of Christians) fail to see: Christianity is unique in its defense of victims. Thus, in a sense, Girard claims that his Christian apologetics is for the most part a reversal of Nietzsche: they both agree that Christianity is singular, but whereas Nietzsche believed this singularity corrupted humanity, Girard believes this singularity is the manifestation of a power that reverses the violent foundations of culture.\n\n### d. Apocalypse and Contemporary Culture\n\nGirard acknowledges that, on the surface, not everything in the New Testament is about peace and love. Indeed, there are some frightening passages in Jesus’ preaching, perhaps the most emblematic “I come not to bring peace, but a sword”. This is part of the apocalyptic worldview prevalent in Jesus’ days. But, much more than that, Girard believes that the apocalyptic teachings to be found in the New Testament are a warning about future *human* violence.\n\nGirard considers that, inasmuch as the New Testament overturns the old scapegoating practices, humanity no longer has the capacity to return to the scapegoating mechanism in order to restore peace. Once victims are revealed as innocent, scapegoating can no longer be relied upon to restore peace. And, in such a sense, there is now an even greater threat of violence. According to Girard, Jesus brings a sword, not in the sense that he himself is going to execute violence, but in the sense that, through his work and the influence of the Bible, humanity will not have the traditional violent means to put an end to violence. The inefficacy of the scapegoat mechanism will bring even more violence. The way to restore peace is not through the scapegoat mechanism, but rather, through the total withdrawal of violence.\n\nThus, Girard believes that, ironically, Christianity has brought about even more violence. But, once again, this violence is not attributable to Christianity itself, but rather, to the stubbornness of human beings who do not want to follow the Christian admonition and insist on putting an end to violence through traditional scapegoating.\n\nGirard believes that, 20th and 21st centuries are more than ever an apocalyptic age. And, once again, he acknowledges a 19th century German figure as a precursor of these views: Carl von Clausewitz. According to Girard, the great Prussian war strategist realized that modern war would no longer be an honorable enterprise, but rather, a brutal activity that has the potential to destroy all of humanity. Indeed, Girard believes 20th and 21st centuries are apocalyptic, but not in the fundamentalist sense. The ‘signs’ of apocalypse are not numerical clues such as 666, but rather, signs that humanity has not found an efficient way to put an end to violence, and unless the Christian message of repentance and withdrawal from violence is assumed, we are headed towards doomsday; not a Final Judgment brought forth by a punishing God, but rather, a doomsday brought about by our own human violence.\n\n## 5\\. Theological Implications\n\nGirard claims not to be a theologian, but rather, a philosophical anthropologist. But, echoing Simone Weil, he believes that the gospels, inasmuch as they reveal the nature of human beings, also indirectly reveal the nature of God. Thus, Girard’s work has great implications for theologians, and his work has generated new ways to interpret the traditional Christian doctrines.\n\n### a. God\n\nGirard is little concerned with the classical theistic attempt to prove the existence of God (for example Aquinas, Plantinga, Craig and Swinburne). But, he does seem to assume that the only way to explain the Bible’s uniqueness in its rejection of scapegoating distortion and its refusal to succumb to the mob’s influence, is by proposing the intervention of a higher celestial power. So, in a weak sense, Girard’s apologetic works try to prove that the Bible is divinely inspired and, therefore, that God exists.\n\nMore importantly, Girard believes that the Bible reveals that the true God is far removed from violence, whereas gods that sanction violence are false gods, that is, idols. By revealing how human violence works, Girard claims, the Bible reveals that this violence does not come from God; rather, God sympathizes with victims and wants nothing to do with victimizers.\n\n### b. The Incarnation\n\nFurthermore, the doctrine of Incarnation becomes especially important under Girard’s interpretation. For God himself incarnates in the person of Jesus, in order to become himself a victim. Thus, God is so far removed from aggressors and scapegoaters, He himself becomes a victim in order to show humanity that He sides with innocent victims. Thus, the way to overturn the scapegoat mechanism is not only by telling the stories from the perspective of the victim, but also by telling the story that the victim itself is God incarnate.\n\n### c. Satan\n\nMost liberal contemporary Christians pay little attention to Satan, but Girard wishes to keep its relevance. Girard has little patience for the literal mythological interpretation of Satan as the red, horned creature. According to Girard, the concept of Satan and the Devil most frequently referred to in the gospels is what it etymologically expresses: the opponent, the accuser. And, in this sense, Satan is the scapegoating mechanism itself (or, perhaps more precisely, the accusing process); that is, the psychological processes in which human beings are caught up by the lynching mob, and eventually succumb to its influence and participate in the collective violence against the scapegoat.\n\nLikewise, the Holy Spirit in Girard’s interpretation is the reverse of Satan. Again, Girard recurs to etymology: the Paraclete etymologically refers to the spirit of defense. Thus, Satan accuses victims, and the Paraclete mercifully defends victims. Thus, the Holy Spirit is understood by Girard as the overturning of the old scapegoating practices.\n\n### d. Original Sin\n\nIn the old Pelagian-Augustinian debate over original sin, Girard’s work clearly sides with Augustine. Under Girard’s interpretation, there is a twofold sense of original sin: 1) human beings are born with the propensity to imitate each other and, eventually, be led to violence; 2) human culture was laid upon the foundations of violence. Thus, human nature is tainted by an original sin, but it can be saved through repentance materialized in the withdrawal from violence.\n\nThe complementary aspect of the original sin debate, that is, free will, has not been tackled by Girard. But, being a Roman Catholic, it is presumable that Girard would not accept the Calvinist concepts of total depravity, irresistible grace and predestination. He seems to believe that human beings are born with sin, but they have the capacity to do something about it through repentance.\n\n### e. Atonement\n\nGirard’s vision of Christianity also brings forth a new interpretation of the doctrine of atonement, that is, that Christ died for our sins. Anselm’s traditional account (God’s honor was offended by the sins of mankind, His honor was reestablished with the death of His own son), or other traditional interpretations (mankind was kidnapped by the Devil, God offered Christ as a ransom; Jesus died so God could show humanity what He is capable of doing if we do not repent, and so forth) are deemed inadequate by Girard. Under Girard’s interpretation, Jesus saved us by becoming a victim and overturning once and for all the scapegoat mechanism. Thanks to Jesus’ salvific mission, human beings now have the capacity to understand what scapegoats really are, and have the golden opportunity to achieve enduring social peace.\n\n## 6\\. Criticisms\n\nAn important source of criticisms against Girard is his apologetic commitment to Christianity. Most critics argue that he has a tendency to twist interpretations of classical texts and myths in order to favor Christian doctrine. Girard has frequently asserted that he was not a Christian for the early part of his life, but that his work as a humanist eventually drove him to Christianity. Also, Girard has been seen with contempt by postmodernist critics who, on the whole, are suspicious of objective truth.\n\n### a. Mimetic Theory Claims Too Much\n\nThe first point of criticism directed at Girard is that he is too ambitious. His initial plausible interpretations of mimetic psychology and anthropology are eventually transformed into a grandiose theoretical system that attempts to explain every aspect of human nature.\n\nConsequently, in such a manner, his methods have been questioned. His theories regarding mimetic desire are derived, not from a careful study of subjects and the implementation of tests, but rather, from the reading of works of fiction. The fact that his theory seems to coincide with what many neuroscientists are informing us about mirror neurons is immaterial: his was just a lucky guess.\n\nThe same critique may be extended to his work on the origins of culture. Again, his scapegoating thesis may be plausible, in as much as it is easy to find many examples of scapegoating processes in human culture. But, to claim that *all* human culture ultimately relies on scapegoating, and that the fundamental cultural institutions (myths, rituals, hunting, domestication of animals, and so forth), are ultimately derived from an original murder, is perhaps too much.\n\nThus, in a sense, Girard’s work is subject to the same criticism of many of the great theoretical systems of the human sciences in the 19th century (Hegel, Freud, Marx, and so forth): his sole concentration on his favorite themes makes him overlook equally plausible alternate explanations for the phenomena he highlights.\n\n### b. The Origins of Culture are Not Verifiable\n\nAs a corollary of the previous objection, empirically-minded philosophers would object that Girard’s theses are not verifiable in a meaningful way. There is little possibility to know what may have happened during Paleolithic times, apart from what paleontology and archaeology might tell us.\n\nIn some instances, Girard claims that his theses have indeed been verified. There have been plenty of archaeological remains that suggest ritual human sacrifice, and plenty of contemporary rituals and myths that suggest scapegoating violence. But, then again, the number of rituals and myths that *do not* display violence is even greater. Girard does not see this as a great obstacle to his theses, because according to him, cultures have a tendency to erase the track of original violence.\n\nBut, in such a case, the empirically-minded philosopher may argue that Girard’s work is not falsifiable in [Popper](https://iep.utm.edu/cr-ratio/)’s sense. There seems to be no possibility of a counter-example that will refute Girard’s thesis. If a violent myth or ritual is considered, Girard will argue that this piece of evidence confirms his hypotheses. If, on the other hand, a non-violent myth or ritual is considered, Girard will once again argue that this piece of evidence confirms his evidence, because it proves that cultures erase tracks of violence in myths and rituals. Thus, Girard is open to the same Popperian objection leveled against Freud: both sexual and non-sexual dreams confirm psychoanalytic theory; therefore, there is no possible way to refute it, and in such a manner, it becomes a meaningless theory.\n\n### c. Girard Exaggerates the Contrast Between Myths and the Bible\n\nGirard is also open to criticism inasmuch as his Christian apologetics seems to rely on an already biased comparison of myths and the Bible. It has been objected that he is not thoroughly fair in the application of standards when contrasting the Bible and myths. Girard’s hermeneutic goes to great lengths to highlight violence in rituals when, in fact, it is not all that evident. He may be accused of being predisposed to find sanctioned violence in myths and, based upon that predisposition, he interprets as sanctioned violence mythical elements that, under another interpretative lens, would not be violent at all. Metaphorically speaking, when studying many myths, Girard is just seeing faces in the clouds, and projecting upon myths some elements that are far from being clear.\n\nIn the same manner, one may object that Girard’s treatment of the Bible, and especially the New Testament, is too benevolent. Most secular historians would agree that there are some hints of persecution against the Jews in the gospels (for example, an exaggeration of Jewish guilt in the arrest and execution of Jesus), and that the historical Jesus’ apocalyptic preaching is not just a warning of future human violence, but rather, an announcement of imminent divine wrath.\n\n### d. Christian Uniqueness Does Not Imply a Divine Origin\n\nEven if Girard’s thesis about the uniqueness of Christianity were accepted, it needn’t prove a divine origin. Perhaps Christianity is unique due to a set of historical and sociological circumstances that drove biblical authors to sympathize with victims (indeed, Max Weber’s explanation is as follows: the Bible’s authors sympathize with victims because they were themselves victims as subjects of the great empires of the Near East). In such a manner, Girard may be accused of incurring an *ad ignorantiam* fallacy. The fact that we cannot currently explain a given phenomenon does not imply that such phenomenon’s origins are supernatural.\n\n### e. Lack of a Precise Scientific Language\n\nEven if one were to accept that the Bible reveals a profound nature about human beings, scientifically-minded philosophers would object that Girard’s language is too obscure and too religiously-based for scientific purposes. Perhaps the Bible does reveal some interesting insights about the nature of scapegoating. But, to name such a process ‘Satan’, or to name the human tendency to incur in rivalries ‘sin’, bears a great potential for confusion. Whenever most readers encounter the word ‘Satan’, they are prone to imagine the nasty horned tailed creature, and not in some sort of abstract psychological mechanism that gives rise to scapegoating violence. So, even if Girard’s use of those terms is metaphoric, they are easily open to confusion, and perhaps should be abandoned.\n\n## 7\\. References and Further Reading\n\n### a.

In simple terms, think of first principles as foundational truths that do not require any additional assumptions.\n- As a simple rule of thumb: when speed and efficiency are critical, use reasoning by analogy; when creativity and innovation are required, use first principles thinking.\n- To leverage first principles thinking, use Socratic Questioning to drill down to the foundational truths of a problem.

In simple terms, think of first principles as foundational truths that do not require any additional assumptions.\n\nThey are the base layer—the atomic unit.\n\n[![](/assets/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6512932b-3752-40d1-bcb4-3ee50860ddb6_4272x2848.jpeg)](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6512932b-3752-40d1-bcb4-3ee50860ddb6_4272x2848.jpeg)\n\nFirst principles thinking—sometimes referred to as \"reasoning from first principles”—is a problem-solving and innovation framework that requires you to deconstruct a complex problem down to these most foundational elements.\n\nThe aim: to ground yourself in the foundational truths and build up from there.\n\nElon Musk explained this in a [2013 interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NV3sBlRgzTI):\n\n> “First principles is kind of a physics way of looking at the world. You boil things down to the most fundamental truths and say, ‘What are we sure is true?’ … and then reason up from there.”\n\nThis method runs in contrast to our natural wiring.\n\nWhen we encounter challenging problems, our tendency is to rely on base level assumptions we have been told are true (or we believe to be true). Why? It’s quick and easy to do.\n\nThis is called \"reasoning by analogy”—it leads to solutions that are much like something else. Slight modifications or iterations on an existing solution. The unimaginative, linear solutions that closely resemble what has been done before.\n\nTo be sure, it can be very useful when speed is the priority. Moving fast has its advantages at times—like if our ancestors were trying to avoid being eaten by a lion! But reasoning by analogy falls short when dealing with complex problems requiring creative, imaginative solutions.\n\nImagine the solution to a problem as a house:\n\n- The foundation of the house is the assumptions upon which the ultimate solution will rest.\n- If it's a shoddy, quickly-built foundation, the house may collapse. Even if it remains standing, the architect and builder will know that they are limited in what they can build on top of it.\n- If it's a sturdy, deliberately-built foundation, the house will thrive. The architect and builder can get creative with what they build on top of it, as they know the base is strong.\n\nFirst principles form that sturdy, deliberately-built foundation for the house.\n\n### Elon Musk & SpaceX\n\nTo bring this to life, let's look at a classic example of first principles thinking in action: Elon Musk & SpaceX.\n\nFirst off, what was the problem?\n\nSending a rocket to Mars to begin the process of making humans an interplanetary species. Yes, I think that meets the bar of being complex…\n\n[![](/assets/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fff169c7d-46fa-492e-9576-232e162a2bda_768x439.webp.jpeg)](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fff169c7d-46fa-492e-9576-232e162a2bda_768x439.webp)\n\nAs he began digging in to develop a solution, Elon Musk quickly discovered the cost of buying a rocket was astronomical (bad pun intended)—$65 million. It was not only financially untenable—SpaceX was a startup at the time—it was also grounded in assumptions of how rockets have always been built and what they should cost.\n\nTaking stock on the situation:\n\n- Complex Problem ✅\n- Creativity > Speed ✅\n\nSo he turned to first principles thinking:\n\n> “Physics teaches you to reason from first principles rather than by analogy. So I said, okay, let’s look at the first principles. What is a rocket made of? Aerospace-grade aluminum alloys, plus some titanium, copper, and carbon fiber. Then I asked, what is the value of those materials on the commodity market? It turned out that the materials cost of a rocket was around two percent of the typical price.”\n\nBased on this upfront analysis, SpaceX began building its own rockets and software systems that would dramatically alter the future of the space economy.\n\nRather than accepting the established \"truths\" about the cost of a rocket, Musk grounded his problem solving in first principles.\n\nToday, SpaceX rockets are doing extraordinary things at a fraction of the historical cost. Furthermore, Elon Musk and SpaceX shattered the deeply-engrained beliefs about the costs of doing business in space, which has unlocked hundreds of other entrepreneurs and companies to build new, innovative solutions for the future.\n\nThe dreams of a Mars voyage in our lifetimes are alive and well…\n\n[![](/assets/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fba5cb3df-55f9-4399-bde4-24fd2db6c058_3372x2248.jpeg)](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fba5cb3df-55f9-4399-bde4-24fd2db6c058_3372x2248.jpeg)\n\n### How to Use First Principles Thinking\n\nOk, now that we have covered the theory, let’s get into the practice. How can YOU leverage first principles thinking to create better outcomes?\n\nFirst—and most importantly—determine if first principles thinking is necessary for your given problem, or if reasoning by analogy is a better fit.\n\nAs a simple rule of thumb:\n\n- For speed/efficiency—reasoning by analogy\n- For creativity/innovation—first principles thinking\n\n[![](/assets/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fee0169ba-07d7-45b0-8c28-fe1ff04e37be_1920x1080.jpeg)](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fee0169ba-07d7-45b0-8c28-fe1ff04e37be_1920x1080.jpeg)\n\nVisualization Credit: Jack Butcher\n\nAssuming first principles thinking is the appropriate path, start by asking questions to drill down to the core of the problem at hand. Shane Parrish calls this \"[Socratic Questioning](https://fs.blog/first-principles/)”—think of it as a methodical process of resurfacing the insatiably curious child inside you.\n\nHere are a few key questions to get you started:\n\n1.  What is the problem I am trying to solve? We often waste time and energy trying to solve the \"wrong\" problem. Identify the \"right\" problem.\n2.  What do I know to be true about this problem? Write down everything you know about the problem (and its previously attempted solutions).\n3.  Why do I believe these \"truths\" to be true? How do I know they are true? Identify the source of your beliefs on the problem. Be ruthless in evaluating their integrity and validity.\n4.  How can I support these beliefs? Is there real evidence to support them? Seek out hard, tangible evidence that proves these beliefs to be true. If you cannot find it, or if the sources are of questionable integrity, you have learned something valuable about your beliefs.\n5.  Are my emotions clouding my judgment and reasoning? When emotions drive our thoughts and decisions, we rarely see good outcomes. Remove emotions from the process.\n6.  What alternative beliefs or viewpoints might exist? Acknowledging and understanding alternative viewpoints is a superpower. Seek them out. Embrace them. Evaluate them on their merits and ask these same fundamental questions about them.\n7.  What are the consequences of being wrong in my original beliefs? Understanding the stakes is critical. Always understand the stakes.\n\nFirst principles thinking starts with questioning your beliefs. Asking these questions will help you drill down to the foundational truths of a problem. Once you uncover them, you can begin to slowly build up to a more creative, imaginative solution.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe world is filled with unimaginative, copycat solutions. These solutions—slight improvements—predictably lead to linear outcomes.\n\nLeveraging first principles thinking is intense and time consuming—but it is also a clear, tried-and-true path to devising creative solutions to complex problems that drive non-linear, asymmetric outcomes.\n\nTim Urban captured it well in a [recent tweet](https://twitter.com/waitbutwhy/status/1374466415864860680?s=20):\n\n> Feed a man a fish, feed him for a night.\n>\n> Teach a man to fish, feed him for a lifetime.\n>\n> Teach a man to reason from first principles, he can teach himself to fish. Then he can invent a better fishing rod and feed a billion people.\n\nFirst principles thinkers are independent thinkers. We can all strive to leverage this framework more effectively in our lives.\n\nThe world will be the ultimate beneficiary…\n\n## Where It Happens Podcast\n\n[![](/assets/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F30c8b5f2-db51-40d7-881a-82ac0e55cfe5_1100x619.png)](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F30c8b5f2-db51-40d7-881a-82ac0e55cfe5_1100x619.png)\n\n**Memes Rule the World with Dogecoin** **Creator Billy Markus**\n\nWatch it on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hljGTDLGdXg) and listen to it on [Apple Podcasts](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/where-it-happens/id1593424985?i=1000548336933) or [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5biMT0ZU1Nb2ljgmDZnLN8?si=948f85cba8bc4e02).

However, there are some additional species of the genus Ephedra we can use to produce this medicine. This preparation was used in traditional Chinese medicine for about 2000 years. However, it is now considered as an unsafe preparation because scientists have found that the dietary supplements containing the alkaloids of Ephedra can cause dangerous side effects, even death.\n\nDifferent species of Ephedra genus contains different alkaloid and non-alkaloid compounds including ephedrine and pseudoephedrine. These compounds are sources of the stimulant and thermogenic effects of Ephedra. These components can stimulate the brain, increasing the heart rate by constricting the blood vessels and expanding the bronchial tubes. The thermogenic properties of Ephedra can cause an increase in [metabolism](https://www.differencebetween.com/difference-between-biotransformation-and-metabolism/#Metabolism) and can increase blood heat.\n\n![Difference Between Ephedra and Ephedrine](inbox/assets/Difference%20Between%20Ephedra%20and%20Ephedrine.jpeg)\n\n**Figure 01: Ephedra in Bottles**\n\nMore importantly, we can observe that athletes tend to consume this medicine as a performance-enhancing drug, though there is no evidence of Ephedra improving athletic performance. In addition, this medicine has been used in the past as a weight-loss aid, in combination with caffeine and [aspirin](https://www.differencebetween.com/difference-between-aspirin-and-vs-tylenol-acetaminophen/).\n\nThe adverse side effects of Ephedra include skin reactions, irritability, nervousness, dizziness, trembling, headache, insomnia, dehydration, itchy scalp, and skin, hyperthermia, etc. The dangerous side effects of this drug may include irregular heartbeat, seizures, heart attack, stroke, and even death.\n\n## What is Ephedrine?\n\nEphedrine is a medication and a stimulant that is useful in preventing low blood pressure during spinal anaesthesia. We can also use this drug to treat asthma, narcolepsy, and obesity. The route of administration preferred for this drug is the mouth, but we can take it as an injection into a muscle, vein, or just under the skin as well. The intravenous injection is the fastest route of administration into the body. Taking the medication from the mouth can take it hours to give the preferred effect.\n\n![Key Difference - Ephedra vs Ephedrine](inbox/assets/Key%20Difference%20-%20Ephedra%20vs%20Ephedrine.png)\n\n**Figure 02: Isomers of Ephedrine**\n\nThere are some common side effects of ephedrine, including trouble sleeping, anxiety, headache, hallucinations, high blood pressure, fast heart rate, loss of appetite, and inability to urinate. Moreover, there are some adverse side effects as well, e.g. stroke, heart attack, and abuse.\n\n## What are the Similarities Between Ephedra and Ephedrine?\n\n- Both are important medications.\n- We can prepare them from the plants of some species of the genus Ephedra.\n- These medications can act as stimulants.\n- They have some serious side effects as well.\n\nEphedra and ephedrine are medications and are stimulants. Ephedra contains some components, including ephedrine and pseudoephedrine. Therefore, ephedrine is a single component in ephedra. The key difference between Ephedra and ephedrine is that Ephedra is stronger and more dangerous as a drug than ephedrine.\n\nThe following table summarizes the differences between Ephedra and ephedrine.\n\n![Difference Between Ephedra and Ephedrine in Tabular Form](inbox/assets/Difference%20Between%20Ephedra%20and%20Ephedrine%20in%20Tabular%20Form.jpeg)\n\n## Summary – Ephedra vs Ephedrine\n\nEphedrine is a component in Ephedra. Ephedra is a medication that is prepared using plants of _Ephedra_ _sinica_ species. The key difference between Ephedra and ephedrine is that Ephedra is stronger and more dangerous as a drug than ephedrine.\n\n##### Reference:\n\n1\\. “Ephedra: Uses, Side Effects, Interactions, Dosage, and Warning.” _WebMD_, [Available here](http://www.webmd.com/vitamins/ai/ingredientmono-847/ephedra).\n\n##### Image Courtesy:\n\n1\\. “EphedrineInBottles” (Public Domain) via [Commons Wikimedia](https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=356615)   \n2\\. “Ephedrine enantiomers” By Vaccinationist – (1R,2S)-(−)-ephedrine on PubChem(1S,2R)-(+)-ephedrine on PubChem (Public Domain) via [Commons Wikimedia](https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=47342043)\n","n":0.04}}},{"i":578,"$":{"0":{"v":"Devops Roadmap Learn to Become a Devops Engineer or Sre","n":0.316},"1":{"v":"\n# [DevOps Roadmap: Learn to become a DevOps Engineer or SRE](https://roadmap.sh/devops)\n\n![|1500](https://res.cloudinary.com/zubayr/image/upload/v1647070500/wiki/yd7c7jrp1bsmlawx1oxs.png)\n\n\n## Open Source\n\nThe project is OpenSource, [7th most starred project on GitHub](https://github.com/search?o=desc&q=stars%3A%3E100000&s=stars&type=Repositories) and is visited by hundreds of thousands of developers every month.\n\nA considerable amount of my time is spent doing unpaid community work on things that I hope will help humanity in some way.

Bloom’s taxonomy was proposed by an educational psychologist Bloom and his colleagues in 1956 in which three domains of learning were identified.\n\nThe domains included cognitive (mental), affective (emotional/feelings/attitude) and psychomotor (physical ability) skills. The cognitive domain is the most widely used in developing goals and objectives for student learning. Bloom’s taxonomy of cognitive objectives describes learning in six levels in the order of: knowledge, comprehension, application, analysis, synthesis and evaluation. The taxonomy was later revised by Anderson and Krathwohl’s (2001). The revised taxonomy is created on a two-dimensional framework to include the cognitive process and knowledge. The cognitive process includes the six levels of thinking skills as remember, understand, apply, analyze, evaluate and create. The knowledge dimension is the core for the six cognitive processes and is classified into four types of knowledge including factual, conceptual, procedural, and meta cognitive knowledge.\n\n### Knowledge\n---------\n\n_Source: adapted from Anderson and Krathwohl, 2001, 4.1, page 46_\n\n*   Factual: The basic elements a student must know to be acquainted with a discipline or solve problems in it.

We are going to use the most popular programming language Python. If you want other automation ideas then you can read [here](https://www.itpanther.com/python-automation-ideas-for-beginners-with-examples/).\n\nPrerequisites:\n\n1.  Download & Install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)\n2.  Install [Tweepy](https://docs.tweepy.org/en/latest/install.html)\n\n## Twitter Developer Account\n\nYou need to register with [Twitter Developer Account](https://developer.twitter.com/) in order to get API Token and API Secret Keys. These will be required to authenticate to twitter on your behalf. Once you make a for twitter developer account than it is probably going to take approximately 24 hours before Twitter team reviews and approves your request.\n\n## Twitter Developer Account Setup to Automate Tweet\n\nYou can follow this [Twitter’s official link](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/developer-portal/overview) for initial setup of your account.\n\n## Download Inspirational Quotes Data\n\nIn this program we are using Inspirational Quotes which can be [downloaded from here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/akhiltak/inspirational-quotes/master/Quotes.csv). This file contains around 75000+ Inspirational Quotes. We are going to read quotes from this file and tweet it.\n\nFeel free to use any other dataset if you want.\n\n## Python Program to Automate Tweet\n\nHere is the complete code which I have written, of-course you can change it as per your need.\n\n```\nimport tweepy\nimport pandas as pd\nimport time\n\nlatest_tweet_number = 0\n\n\nwith open('C:\\\\twitter\\\\latest.txt') as f:\n    latest_tweet_number = int(f.read())\n\nprint(latest_tweet_number)\n\nimport pandas as pd\ndf = pd.read_csv(r'C:\\Users\\USER\\Downloads\\quotes.csv', sep=';')\n\ndef tweet_now(msg):\n    msg = msg[0:270]\n    try:\n\n        auth = tweepy.OAuthHandler(\"DthisisnotrealEcjpTv1\", \n            \"h3dHaEQrjlOGT5Bqtw1DthisisnotrealLgNjVV0L05hRJ\")\n        auth.set_access_token(\"2517455480-UQBnDthisisnotrealSn9CI5oN\", \n            \"2WNbmrhXWDthisisnotrealNKBzUL\")\n        api = tweepy.API(auth)\n        try:\n            api.verify_credentials()\n            print(\"Authentication OK\")\n        except:\n            print(\"Error during authentication\")\n        api = tweepy.API(auth, wait_on_rate_limit=True, wait_on_rate_limit_notify=True)\n        api.update_status(msg)\n        print(msg)\n\n        print(\"Tweeted\")\n    \n    except Exception as e:\n        print(e)\n\nfor idx, rows in df.iterrows():\n    if idx <= latest_tweet_number:\n        continue\n        \n    hashtags = '#inspirational #inspiration #motivation #motivational #inspirationalquotes #inspire #motivationalquotes #quotes #love #quoteoftheday #success #believe #mindset #life #positivevibes #entrepreneur #quote #positivity #goals #selflove #happiness #lifestyle #successquotes #bhfyp #yourself #thoughts #instadaily #loveyourself #photooftheday #bhfyp'\n    tweet_now(rows['QUOTE'] + ' - ' + rows['AUTHOR'] + '\\n\\n\\n' + hashtags)\n    \n    with open('C:\\\\twitter\\\\latest.txt',\"w\") as f:\n        f.write(str(idx))\n\n    print(\"done\")\n    time.sleep(1800)\n    \n```\n\n## Scheduling Program\n\nIf you want to run this program 24\\*7 then you need to make sure that you are running it on one of the servers which remains always available. I would recommend to use IBM Cloud as you can just sign-up there without the need of using any Credit Card.\n\nI tried using IBM Cloud Functions which gives you option to run your Python program without the need of creating any servers. IBM Cloud Function is server-less which can be used to trigger your python code based on any Trigger or Scheduled Frequency.\n\n## Automate Tweets Video\n\nIf you are someone who likes to see the steps in order to understand it better than you can watch this video.\n","n":0.048}}},{"i":590,"$":{"0":{"v":"Aredotna","n":1},"1":{"v":"\n# [Are.na](https://www.are.na/)\n\nThe Secret\n\n**Allow yourself to go down rabbit holes**\n\nA rabbit hole is not a distraction.

At your funeral people will not recall what you did; they will only remember how you made them feel.\n\n• Recipe for success: under-promise and over-deliver.\n\n• It’s not an apology if it comes with an excuse. It is not a compliment if it comes with a request.\n\n• Jesus, Superman, and Mother Teresa never made art. Only imperfect beings can make art because art begins in what is broken.\n\n• If someone is trying to convince you it’s not a pyramid scheme, it’s a pyramid scheme.\n\n• Learn how to tie a bowline knot. Practice in the dark. With one hand. For the rest of your life you’ll use this knot more times than you would ever believe.\n\n• If something fails where you thought it would fail, that is not a failure.\n\n• Be governed not by the tyranny of the urgent but by the elevation of the important.\n\n• Leave a gate behind you the way you first found it.\n\n• The greatest rewards come from working on something that nobody has a name for. If you possibly can, work where there are no words for what you do.\n\n• A balcony or porch needs to be at least 6 feet (2m) deep or it won’t be used.\n\n• Don’t create things to make money; make money so you can create things. The reward for good work is more work.\n\n• In all things — except love — start with the exit strategy. Prepare for the ending. Almost anything is easier to get into than out of.\n\n• Train employees well enough they could get another job, but treat them well enough so they never want to.\n\n• Don’t aim to have others like you; aim to have them respect you.\n\n• The foundation of maturity: Just because it’s not your fault doesn’t mean it’s not your responsibility.\n\n• A multitude of bad ideas is necessary for one good idea.\n\n• Being wise means having more questions than answers.\n\n• Compliment people behind their back. It’ll come back to you.\n\n• Most overnight successes — in fact any significant successes — take at least 5 years. Budget your life accordingly.\n\n• You are only as young as the last time you changed your mind.\n\n• Assume anyone asking for your account information for any reason is guilty of scamming you, unless proven innocent. The way to prove innocence is to call them back, or login to your account using numbers or a website that you provide, not them. Don’t release any identifying information while they are contacting you via phone, message or email. You must control the channel.\n\n• Sustained outrage makes you stupid.\n\n• Be strict with yourself and forgiving of others. The reverse is hell for everyone.\n\n• Your best response to an insult is “You’re probably right.” Often they are.\n\n• The worst evils in history have always been committed by those who truly believed they were combating evil. Beware of combating evil.\n\n• If you can avoid seeking approval of others, your power is limitless.\n\n• When a child asks an endless string of “why?” questions, the smartest reply is, “I don’t know, what do you think?”\n\n• To be wealthy, accumulate all those things that money can’t buy.\n\n• Be the change you wish to see.\n\n• When brainstorming, improvising, jamming with others, you’ll go much further and deeper if you build upon each contribution with a playful “yes — and” example instead of a deflating “no — but” reply.\n\n• Work to become, not to acquire.\n\n• Don’t loan money to a friend unless you are ready to make it a gift.\n\n• On the way to a grand goal, celebrate the smallest victories as if each one were the final goal. No matter where it ends you are victorious.\n\n• Calm is contagious.\n\n• Even a foolish person can still be right about most things. Most conventional wisdom is true.\n\n• Always cut away from yourself.\n\n• Show me your calendar and I will tell you your priorities. Tell me who your friends are, and I’ll tell you where you’re going.\n\n• When hitchhiking, look like the person you want to pick you up.\n\n• Contemplating the weaknesses of others is easy; contemplating the weaknesses in yourself is hard, but it pays a much higher reward.\n\n• Worth repeating: measure twice, cut once.\n\n• Your passion in life should fit you exactly; but your purpose in life should exceed you. Work for something much larger than yourself.\n\n• If you can’t tell what you desperately need, it’s probably sleep.\n\n• When playing Monopoly, spend all you have to buy, barter, or trade for the Orange properties. Don’t bother with Utilities.\n\n• If you borrow something, try to return it in better shape than you received it. Clean it, sharpen it, fill it up.\n\n• Even in the tropics it gets colder at night than you think. Pack warmly.\n\n• To quiet a crowd or a drunk, just whisper.\n\n• Writing down one thing you are grateful for each day is the cheapest possible therapy ever.\n\n• When someone tells you something is wrong, they’re usually right. When someone tells you how to fix it, they’re usually wrong.\n\n• If you think you saw a mouse, you did. And, if there is one, there are more.\n\n• Money is overrated. Truly new things rarely need an abundance of money. If that was so, billionaires would have a monopoly on inventing new things, and they don’t. Instead almost all breakthroughs are made by those who lack money, because they are forced to rely on their passion, persistence and ingenuity to figure out new ways. Being poor is an advantage in innovation.\n\n• Ignore what others may be thinking of you, because they aren’t.\n\n• Avoid hitting the snooze button. That’s just training you to oversleep.\n\n• Always say less than necessary.\n\n• You are given the gift of life in order to discover what your gift \\*in\\* life is. You will complete your mission when you figure out what your mission is. This is not a paradox. This is the way.\n\n• Don’t treat people as bad as they are. Treat them as good as you are.\n\n• It is much easier to change how you think by changing your behavior, than it is to change your behavior by changing how you think. Act out the change you seek.\n\n• You can eat any dessert you want if you take only 3 bites.\n\n• Each time you reach out to people, bring them a blessing; then they’ll be happy to see you when you bring them a problem.\n\n• Bad things can happen fast, but almost all good things happen slowly.\n\n• Don’t worry how or where you begin. As long as you keep moving, your success will be far from where you start.\n\n• When you confront a stuck bolt or screw: righty tighty, lefty loosey.\n\n• If you meet a jerk, overlook them. If you meet jerks everywhere everyday, look deeper into yourself.\n\n• Dance with your hips.\n\n• We are not bodies that temporarily have souls. We are souls that temporarily have bodies.\n\n• You can reduce the annoyance of someone’s stupid belief by increasing your understanding of why they believe it.\n\n• If your goal does not have a schedule, it is a dream.\n\n• All the greatest gains in life — in wealth, relationships, or knowledge —come from the magic of compounding interest — amplifying small steady gains. All you need for abundance is to keep adding 1% more than you subtract on a regular basis.\n\n• The greatest breakthroughs are missed because they look like hard work.\n\n• People can’t remember more than 3 points from a speech.\n\n• I have never met a person I admired who did not read more books than I did.\n\n• The greatest teacher is called “doing”.\n\n• Finite games are played to win or lose. Infinite games are played to keep the game going. Seek out infinite games because they yield infinite rewards.\n\n• Everything is hard before it is easy. The day before something is a breakthrough, it’s a stupid idea.\n\n• A problem that can be solved with money is not really a problem.\n\n• When you are stuck, sleep on it. Let your subconscious work for you.\n\n• Your work will be endless, but your time is finite. You cannot limit the work so you must limit your time. Hours are the only thing you can manage.\n\n• To succeed, get other people to pay you; to become wealthy, help other people to succeed.\n\n• Children totally accept — and crave — family rules. “In our family we have a rule for X” is the only excuse a parent needs for setting a family policy. In fact, “I have a rule for X” is the only excuse you need for your own personal policies.\n\n• All guns are loaded.\n\n• Many backward steps are made by standing still.\n\n• This is the best time ever to make something. None of the greatest, coolest creations 20 years from now have been invented yet. You are not late.\n\n• No rain, no rainbow.\n\n• Every person you meet knows an amazing lot about something you know virtually nothing about. Your job is to discover what it is, and it won’t be obvious.\n\n• You don’t marry a person, you marry a family.\n\n• Always give credit, take blame.\n\n• Be frugal in all things, except in your passions splurge.\n\n• When making something, always get a few extras — extra material, extra parts, extra space, extra finishes. The extras serve as backups for mistakes, reduce stress, and fill your inventory for the future. They are the cheapest insurance.\n\n• Something does not need to be perfect to be wonderful. Especially weddings.\n\n• Don’t let your email inbox become your to-do list.\n\n• The best way to untangle a knotty tangle is not to “untie” the knots, but to keep pulling the loops apart wider and wider. Just make the mess as big, loose and open as possible. As you open up the knots they will unravel themselves. Works on cords, strings, hoses, yarns, or electronic cables.\n\n• Be a good ancestor. Do something a future generation will thank you for. A simple thing is to plant a tree.\n\n• To combat an adversary, become their friend.\n\n• Take one simple thing — almost anything — but take it extremely seriously, as if it was the only thing in the world, or maybe the entire world is in it — and by taking it seriously you’ll light up the sky.\n\n• History teaches us that in 100 years from now some of the assumptions you believed will turn out to be wrong. A good question to ask yourself today is “What might I be wrong about?”\n\n• Be nice to your children because they are going to choose your nursing home.\n\n• Advice like these are not laws. They are like hats. If one doesn’t fit, try another.\n\n*For more see my previous [68 Bits of Unsolicited Advice](https://kk.org/thetechnium/68-bits-of-unsolicited-advice/).*\n\nTranslation in [Italian](https://marcocevoli.com/blog/altri-99-consigli-non-richiesti).

For the life of me, I could not remember `iperf`. Not being able to remember previously used command line tools is frustrating and something we can all relate to. So I created a go-to list of network tools for myself. Then, I thought, why not turn this list into a blog post?

It is the first program I start in the morning and the last one I close in the evening. It is the program that I regularly tweak to boost my overall productivity. From my perspective, Microsoft’s release of Windows Terminal 1.0 and WSL 2.0 will boost overall Shell adoption. Over the past decade, I have seen numerous users installing and using different shells. However, the number of people that invest time in configuring their shell to be more productive is just a small percentage. And that is a shame!\n\nYou can also stick with tools like Finder or Windows Explorer if you install and use a shell without customizing it. Shells like ZSH shine once they have individual configurations: configurations that make you - the user - super productive. I wrote this article for inspiration. It should demonstrate how you can increase your overall productivity with simple things like adopting the 5 types of aliases in ZSH. Aliases are the first step towards a tailored shell experience. Aliases are a super individual thing.\n\nI use Docker, Kubernetes, and Microsoft Azure every day. That said, it makes sense for me to have aliases supporting me with these tools and environments. However, maybe you are using different clouds and command-line tools so that you will end up with different aliases. The key takeaway should be that you create and use aliases to help you get your job done.\n\nAll your aliases are defined in `~/.zshrc`. ZSH loads the configuration file during startup. However, you can always force to reload your configuration file use `source ~/.zshrc`.\n\nThis article will teach you how to create and use these five types of aliases:\n\n-   [Simple Aliases](https://www.thorsten-hans.com/#simple-aliases)\n-   [Suffix Aliases](https://www.thorsten-hans.com/#suffix-aliases)\n-   [Functions for Aliases With Parameters](https://www.thorsten-hans.com/#functions-for-aliases-with-parameters)\n-   [Global Aliases](https://www.thorsten-hans.com/#global-aliases)\n-   [Operating system specific aliases](https://www.thorsten-hans.com/#operating-system-specific-aliases)\n\n## Simple Aliases\n\nSimple Aliases are a good starting point. I use them to reduce the number of keystrokes to fire up a command. The definition of a simple alias uses the `alias my-alias=\"command\"` pattern.\n\n```\n# navigation aliases\nalias dev=\"cd ~/dev/\"\nalias personal=\"cd ~/dev/thorstenhans\"\nalias business=\"cd ~/dev/thinktecture\"\n\n# kubectl aliases\nalias k=\"kubectl\"\nalias kgx=\"kubectl config get-contexts\"\n\n# docker aliases\nalias d=\"docker\"\nalias dps=\"docker ps\"\n```\n\nHaving those aliases registered in my `~/.zshrc`, I can navigate quickly to commonly used directories and to fire-up commands that I use frequently using just a few keystrokes.\n\n## Suffix Aliases\n\nSuffix Aliases are defined using the `-s` flag. With suffix aliases, you can launch files with a specific extension (or suffix) in your favorite tool. To register a suffix alias, we use the `alias -s extension=name-of-the-tool` pattern. The following samples assume that VisualStudio Code is installed and can be launched using the `code` command from the terminal.\n\n```\n# Azure CLI files\nalias -s azcli=code\n\n# Markdown files\nalias -s md=code\n\n# JSON files\nalias -s json=code\n\n# bulk association\nalias -s {cs,ts,html}=code\n```\n\nLoad the modified `~/.zshrc` and execute the following:\n\n```\necho \"#Hello World\" > sample.md\n\n# now type the name of the file and commit via ENTER\nsample.md\n```\n\nThe suffix alias translates `sample.md` into `code sample.md`, and you should see VisualStudio Code launching and showing the content of `sample.md`.\n\n## Functions for Aliases With Parameters\n\nSometimes you want to create aliases that require some contextual information. Parameters are used to describe this contextual information for shell commands. The registration of aliases with parameters looks pretty similar to a function definition in regular programming languages. We use the following pattern to define aliases with parameters:\n\n```\naliasname() {\n  command $firstParam $secondParam\n}\n```\n\nFor example, consider you want to optimize the process of listing Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) instances in your Azure Subscription. To achieve this, Azure CLI provides the `az aks list` command. The command allows further configuration by adding several parameters.\n\nThe following alias accepts two parameters—first, the Resource Group Name (Resource Groups are logical containers in Azure). The second parameter specifies the desired output format.\n\n```\ngetaks() {\n  az aks list -g $1 -o $2\n}\n```\n\nWe can now use the `getaks` alias with parameters to look for AKS instances in `resource-group-1` and print results in colored JSON (`jsonc`) using `getaks resource-group-1 jsonc`.\n\n## Global Aliases\n\nGlobal aliases are defined using the `-g` flag. A global alias is aggressive. Once registered, it replaces all occurrences of the alias name with the specified command. The definition follows the pattern `alias -g aliasName=\"command\"`.\n\n```\n# I have to ask for Azure Resource Ids frequently\nalias -g qId=\"--query id -o tsv\"\n```\n\nHaving `qId` registered as a global alias, I can optimize my performance when asking for unique resource identifiers using Azure CLI. See the following snippet comparing the regular command, to the optimized one using my global alias:\n\n```\n# proper command to query the identifier of an AKS instance\naz aks show -n myaks2020 -g rg-demo --query id -o tsv\n\n# command to query the identifier of an AKS instance with global alias\naz aks show -n myaks2020 -g rg-demo qId\n```\n\n## Operating system specific aliases\n\nAn operating system specific alias is not a real type. However, I think platform-specific aliases are important—especially when using multiple platforms. I use macOS as a daily driver, so I also have some aliases tied to my rig.\n\nHowever, I love VisualStudio Codespaces that are using Linux as an operating system. In both situations, I want to use my dotfiles. To achieve this, I use simple `if`\\-statements.\n\n```\n# macOS aliasses\nif [[ $OSTYPE == darwin* ]]; then\nalias flush='dscacheutil -flushcache'\n# Apps\nalias browse=\"open -a /Applications/Google\\ Chrome.app\"\n# * Browse Azure Portal\nalias azure=\"browse https://preview.portal.azure.com\"\nfi\n```\n\nSee the following image showing all my platform related aliases for macOS:\n\n![Platform specific aliases in ZSH](https://www.thorsten-hans.com/images/zsh-aliases-1.png \"5 alias types in zsh - platform specific aliases\")\n\n## Use Aliases To Edit and Reload .zshrc <!– omit in toc –>\n\nI have two aliases in my `~/.zshrc`, which are super-efficient. I open my `~/.zshrc` in my favorite editor with `ec` and source it (apply the current state of `~/.zshrc` to your ZSH session) with `sc`. The alias definition for both looks like this:\n\n```\n# open ~/.zshrc in using the default editor specified in $EDITOR\nalias ec=\"$EDITOR $HOME/.zshrc\"\n\n# source ~/.zshrc\nalias sc=\"source $HOME/.zshrc\"\n```\n\n## Conclusion <!– omit in toc –>\n\nYou have seen five different types of ZSH aliases (counting os-specific aliases as dedicated type) that will boost your productivity.\n\nTake your time. Do some research. Identify the command-line tools you are using daily or regularly, find patterns, and create corresponding aliases that increase your productivity by reducing keystrokes.\n\nHaving powerful shells on all operating systems (finally including windows using WSL 2.0), you should care about your shell performance. Make ZSH your own.\n\nI do a lot of conference speaking; if you are presenting at conferences or meetups too, you should start your presentation by quickly explaining the aliases you will use throughout the talk to onboard your audience. Maybe they are using `kc` instead of `k` for `kubectl`. 😂\n\nSpecial thanks to [Sundeep Agarwal](https://github.com/learnbyexample) for pointing me to some typos and to [simohamed](https://github.com/smhmd) for the tip regarding bulk association for suffix aliases.\n","n":0.03}}},{"i":603,"$":{"0":{"v":"4 Essential Linux Productivity Tools Ulauncher, Espanso, Planner, and Obsidian","n":0.316},"1":{"v":"\n# [4 Essential Linux productivity tools: Ulauncher, Espanso, Planner, and Obsidian](https://input.sh/linux-productivity-tools/)\n\nAs a user of a Linux-based operating system, I always envied macOS users for the choice of productivity tools available on their disposal, with tools like [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/) , [TextExpander](https://textexpander.com/) , [Bear](https://bear.app/) , [Keyboard Maestro](https://www.keyboardmaestro.com/main/) , [OmniFocus](https://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus/) and so forth. I believe I've achieved comparable results on my [elementary OS](https://elementary.io/) install, and I want to share the tools I'm relying on on a daily basis.\n\n## A better launcher\n\nI have a lot of respect for Slingshot, a default launcher for **elementary OS**. It has some features that I really miss when I'm not behind my favourite desktop environment, most notable of which are:\n\n1.  **Fuzzy search:** Instead of having to type \"firefox\" precisely, I can (mis)type something that resembles the word Firefox and it will still show it as a result. For example: \"ffx\", \"frf\", \"ffox\". Any combination of letters contained in the word \"Firefox\" will return it as a result.\n2.  **Quick calculations:** When I want to quickly calculate something basic, I don't have to start a dedicated calculator app. I just press the ~start~ meta key and do them straight from my app launcher.\n\n[Ulauncher](https://ulauncher.io/) takes it a step further, similarly to how Alfred does it on a macOS. Sure, I can launch applications using it, but I can also install plugins for it that allow me to quickly reach many, *many* functions. Some examples include:\n\n-   [Starting a timer](https://ext.ulauncher.io/-/github-ulauncher-ulauncher-timer) with something like `ti 10m Message goes here`, which will show me a desktop notification with a defined message after the specified amount of time.\n-   [Control Spotify](https://ext.ulauncher.io/-/github-pywkm-ulauncher-spotify) . Typing `sp` gives me the ability to pause/play current track, as well as to skip to the next or previous track.\n-   [SSH connection manager](https://ext.ulauncher.io/-/github-jetbug123-ulauncher-ssh) allows me to quickly reach SSH connections saved in my `~/.ssh/config`.\n-   [Clipboard manager](https://ext.ulauncher.io/-/github-friday-ulauncher-clipboard) saves anything that's in my clipboard, allowing me to quickly access things I've copied over.\n\nDepending on your needs, it can do a lot more, like [launch VSCode projects](https://ext.ulauncher.io/-/github-brpaz-ulauncher-vscode-projects) , [manage Docker containers](https://ext.ulauncher.io/-/github-brpaz-ulauncher-docker) , [calculate hashes](https://ext.ulauncher.io/-/github-friday-ulauncher-hash2) , [search through Jira](https://ext.ulauncher.io/-/github-safaariman-ulauncher-jira) , [do an IP lookup](https://ext.ulauncher.io/-/github-munim-ulauncher-ip-lookup) , [convert units](https://ext.ulauncher.io/-/github-noam09-ulauncher-units) , look for a password in [Bitwarden](https://ext.ulauncher.io/-/github-kbialek-ulauncher-bitwarden) or [LastPass](https://ext.ulauncher.io/-/github-brpaz-ulauncher-lastpass) and on and on and on.\n\nI use a combination of the two. I use the default launcher for launching apps and doing some calculations, and I use Ulauncher to do so much more.\n\nUnfortunately, none of these solutions have something similar to [Alfred's Workflows](https://www.alfredapp.com/workflows/) , but you can create your own Ulauncher extensiosn or launch scripts written in your preferred scripting language.\n\n## Glorified to-do list manager\n\nI don't think *any* to-do app available on Linux comes even close to being as beautiful and feature-packed as Planner. Just look at how pretty it is!\n\n![Planner's main interface](inbox/assets/Planner's%20main%20interface.png)\n\nYour projects can be organised into folders, and your tasks can have labels, deadlines, reminders, and so on. Tasks can be organized into projects, sections, and have sub-tasks. You can sync them with Todoist to have them available on more devices, but you don't have to.\n\nSimilarly to Todoist, you can see all the tasks that have a deadline set to today + any overdue tasks, you can see the tasks that are due soon, and you have an inbox as a place where you can store the tasks quickly without having to figure out which project they should go to.\n\nOne killer feature for me is that I can have a keyboard shortcut that toggles the quick add window, allowing me to add a new task pretty effortlessly regardless of which app I'm using.\n\n## Expanding text\n\nFor text expansion, I use a cross-platform tool written in Rust called [Espanso](https://espanso.org/) . Regardless of what I'm typing, I can define shortcuts that convert something easy to write in something that takes more effort. For example, I can type `:date` in any text field and it will be swapped by today's date when I press the space bar.\n\nI can define custom text replacements by simply adding two lines inside a YAML file (`~/.config/espanso/default.yml`):\n\n```\nmatches:\n  - trigger: \":hw\"\n    replace: \"Hello world\"\n```\n\nIt can also use a trigger to return an output from a script or a shell command, though I have yet to find a use case for that. You can also configure a shortcut to trigger a [passive mode](https://espanso.org/docs/passive-mode/) , which will select everything in the current text field and expand it if it finds any triggers you've defined.\n\nOn the downside, it currently doesn't come with a graphical interface, though a graphical interface is at the top of its [roadmap](https://github.com/federico-terzi/espanso/issues/255) .\n\n## A note-taking system\n\nI've tried many solutions for note taking over the years, like keeping my notes in Markdown files, [Notion](https://www.notion.so/) , and [Inkdrop](https://www.inkdrop.app/) . That all ended when I found out about [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) . It's my go-to note taking system ever since it launched in public beta and I can't see myself using anything else for the foreseeable future.\n\nA few months ago I wrote about [why I do(n't) keep my notes in Markdown](https://input.sh/why-i-dont-write-my-notes-in-markdown/). In it, I emphasized a certain set of problems I've experienced whenever I wanted to keep my notes inside of a folder full of Markdown files:\n\n1.  Linking between notes is hard.\n2.  Dealing with images is hard.\n3.  Editing notes on a phone.\n4.  Clipping articles into my notes.\n\nThe first two are instantly solved by Obsidian out-of-the-box. [GitJournal](https://gitjournal.io/) solved my third one, and I've solved the last one by [adjusting the script](https://gitjournal.io/) I've outlined in the previous article.\n\nNow I can truly keep all of my notes in one place and sync them between devices however I want to. I can also generate a handy graph showing various links I've created between my notes:\n\n![Screenshot-from-2020-08-03-14-44-40](inbox/assets/Screenshot-from-2020-08-03-14-44-40.png)\n\n## In conclusion\n\nI was able to transform my Linux experience to another level using a combination of awesome productivity tools that work natively on my Linux-based system. Overall, I'm pretty happy with my setup, as I was able to find an alternative to the majority of macOS-specific productivity tools I always wished to have access to.\n\nIf you know of a similarly useful Linux-based productivity tool or are building one, please let me know on Mastodon / Twitter, as I'd love to be one of your first users. I'm not an open source purist and I'm more than willing to pay money for something that will truly improve my daily workflow.\n","n":0.031}}},{"i":604,"$":{"0":{"v":"30 life lessons I learned before turning 30","n":0.354},"1":{"v":"\n- Author: [[resources.people.Anne-Laure Le Cunff]]\n- `url:` https://nesslabs.com/30-life-lessons\n- Status: read\n- `reviewed date:` 31-10-2021\n- `areas:`\n","n":0.277}}},{"i":605,"$":{"0":{"v":"30 Handy Bash Shell Aliases For Linux, Unix, MacOS","n":0.333},"1":{"v":"\n[30 Handy Bash Shell Aliases For Linux / Unix / MacOS](https://www.cyberciti.biz/tips/bash-aliases-mac-centos-linux-unix.html)\n","n":0.302}}},{"i":606,"$":{"0":{"v":"103 Bits of Advice I Wish I Had Known","n":0.333},"1":{"v":"\n# [103 Bits of Advice I Wish I Had Known](https://kk.org/thetechnium/103-bits-of-advice-i-wish-i-had-known/)\n\nToday is my birthday. I turn 70. I’ve learned a few things so far that might be helpful to others. For the past few years, I’ve jotted down bits of unsolicited advice each year and much to my surprise I have more to add this year. So here is my birthday gift to you all: 103 bits of wisdom I wish I had known when I was young.\n\n(Previous years [here](https://kk.org/thetechnium/99-additional-bits-of-unsolicited-advice/) and [here](https://kk.org/thetechnium/68-bits-of-unsolicited-advice/).)\n\n• About 99% of the time, the right time is right now.\n\n• No one is as impressed with your possessions as you are.\n\n• Dont ever work for someone you dont want to become.\n\n• Cultivate 12 people who love you, because they are worth more than 12 million people who like you.\n\n• Dont keep making the same mistakes; try to make new mistakes.\n\n• If you stop to listen to a musician or street performer for more than a minute, you owe them a dollar.\n\n• Anything you say before the word “but” does not count.\n\n• When you forgive others, they may not notice, but you will heal. Forgiveness is not something we do for others; it is a gift to ourselves.\n\n• Courtesy costs nothing. Lower the toilet seat after use. Let the people in the elevator exit before you enter. Return shopping carts to their designated areas. When you borrow something, return it better shape (filled up, cleaned) than when you got it.\n\n• Whenever there is an argument between two sides, find the third side.\n\n• Efficiency is highly overrated; Goofing off is highly underrated. Regularly scheduled sabbaths, sabbaticals, vacations, breaks, aimless walks and time off are essential for top performance of any kind. The best work ethic requires a good rest ethic.\n\n• When you lead, your real job is to create more leaders, not more followers.\n\n• Criticize in private, praise in public.\n\n• Life lessons will be presented to you in the order they are needed. Everything you need to master the lesson is within you. Once you have truly learned a lesson, you will be presented with the next one. If you are alive, that means you still have lessons to learn.\n\n• It is the duty of a student to get everything out of a teacher, and the duty of a teacher to get everything out of a student.\n\n• If winning becomes too important in a game, change the rules to make it more fun. Changing rules can become the new game.\n\n• Ask funders for money, and they’ll give you advice; but ask for advice and they’ll give you money.\n\n• Productivity is often a distraction. Don’t aim for better ways to get through your tasks as quickly as possible, rather aim for better tasks that you never want to stop doing.\n\n• Immediately pay what you owe to vendors, workers, contractors. They will go out of their way to work with you first next time.\n\n• The biggest lie we tell ourselves is “I dont need to write this down because I will remember it.”\n\n• Your growth as a conscious being is measured by the number of uncomfortable conversations you are willing to have.\n\n• Speak confidently as if you are right, but listen carefully as if you are wrong.\n\n• Handy measure: the distance between your fingertips of your outstretched arms at shoulder level is your height.\n\n• The consistency of your endeavors (exercise, companionship, work) is more important than the quantity. Nothing beats small things done every day, which is way more important than what you do occasionally.\n\n• Making art is not selfish; it’s for the rest of us. If you don’t do your thing, you are cheating us.\n\n• Never ask a woman if she is pregnant. Let her tell you if she is.\n\n• Three things you need: The ability to not give up something till it works, the ability to give up something that does not work, and the trust in other people to help you distinguish between the two.\n\n• When public speaking, pause frequently. Pause before you say something in a new way, pause after you have said something you believe is important, and pause as a relief to let listeners absorb details.\n\n• There is no such thing as being “on time.” You are either late or you are early. Your choice.\n\n• Ask anyone you admire: Their lucky breaks happened on a detour from their main goal. So embrace detours. Life is not a straight line for anyone.\n\n• The best way to get a correct answer on the internet is to post an obviously wrong answer and wait for someone to correct you.\n\n• You’ll get 10x better results by elevating good behavior rather than punishing bad behavior, especially in children and animals.\n\n• Spend as much time crafting the subject line of an email as the message itself because the subject line is often the only thing people read.\n\n• Don’t wait for the storm to pass; dance in the rain.\n\n• When checking references for a job applicant, employers may be reluctant or prohibited from saying anything negative, so leave or send a message that says, “Get back to me if you highly recommend this applicant as super great.” If they don’t reply take that as a negative.\n\n• Use a password manager: Safer, easier, better.\n\n• Half the skill of being educated is learning what you can ignore.\n\n• The advantage of a ridiculously ambitious goal is that it sets the bar very high so even in failure it may be a success measured by the ordinary.\n\n• A great way to understand yourself is to seriously reflect on everything you find irritating in others.\n\n• Keep all your things visible in a hotel room, not in drawers, and all gathered into one spot. That way you’ll never leave anything behind. If you need to have something like a charger off to the side, place a couple of other large items next to it, because you are less likely to leave 3 items behind than just one.\n\n• Denying or deflecting a compliment is rude. Accept it with thanks, even if you believe it is not deserved.\n\n• Always read the plaque next to the monument.\n\n• When you have some success, the feeling of being an imposter can be real. Who am I fooling? But when you create things that only you — with your unique talents and experience — can do, then you are absolutely not an imposter. You are the ordained. It is your duty to work on things that only you can do.\n\n• What you do on your bad days matters more than what you do on your good days.\n\n• Make stuff that is good for people to have.\n\n• When you open paint, even a tiny bit, it will always find its way to your clothes no matter how careful you are. Dress accordingly.\n\n• To keep young kids behaving on a car road trip, have a bag of their favorite candy and throw a piece out the window each time they misbehave.\n\n• You cannot get smart people to work extremely hard just for money.\n\n• When you don’t know how much to pay someone for a particular task, ask them “what would be fair” and their answer usually is.\n\n• 90% of everything is crap. If you think you don’t like opera, romance novels, TikTok, country music, vegan food, NFTs, keep trying to see if you can find the 10% that is not crap.\n\n• You will be judged on how well you treat those who can do nothing for you.\n\n• We tend to overestimate what we can do in a day, and underestimate what we can achieve in a decade. Miraculous things can be accomplished if you give it ten years. A long game will compound small gains to overcome even big mistakes.\n\n• Thank a teacher who changed your life.\n\n• You cant reason someone out of a notion that they didn’t reason themselves into.\n\n• Your best job will be one that you were unqualified for because it stretches you. In fact only apply to jobs you are unqualified for.\n\n• Buy used books. They have the same words as the new ones. Also libraries.\n\n• You can be whatever you want, so be the person who ends meetings early.\n\n• A wise man said, “Before you speak, let your words pass through three gates. At the first gate, ask yourself, “Is it true?” At the second gate ask, “Is it necessary?” At the third gate ask, “Is it kind?”\n\n• Take the stairs.\n\n• What you actually pay for something is at least twice the listed price because of the energy, time, money needed to set it up, learn, maintain, repair, and dispose of at the end. Not all prices appear on labels. Actual costs are 2x listed prices.\n\n• When you arrive at your room in a hotel, locate the emergency exits. It only takes a minute.\n\n• The only productive way to answer “what should I do now?” is to first tackle the question of “who should I become?”\n\n• Average returns sustained over an above-average period of time yield extraordinary results. Buy and hold.\n\n• It’s thrilling to be extremely polite to rude strangers.\n\n• It’s possible that a not-so smart person, who can communicate well, can do much better than a super smart person who can’t communicate well. That is good news because it is much easier to improve your communication skills than your intelligence.\n\n• Getting cheated occasionally is the small price for trusting the best of everyone, because when you trust the best in others, they generally treat you best.\n\n• Art is whatever you can get away with.\n\n• For the best results with your children, spend only half the money you think you should, but double the time with them.\n\n• Purchase the most recent tourist guidebook to your home town or region. You’ll learn a lot by playing the tourist once a year.\n\n• Dont wait in line to eat something famous. It is rarely worth the wait.\n\n• To rapidly reveal the true character of a person you just met, move them onto an abysmally slow internet connection. Observe.\n\n• Prescription for popular success: do something strange. Make a habit of your weird.\n\n• Be a pro. Back up your back up. Have at least one physical backup and one backup in the cloud. Have more than one of each. How much would you pay to retrieve all your data, photos, notes, if you lost them? Backups are cheap compared to regrets.\n\n• Dont believe everything you think you believe.\n\n• To signal an emergency, use the rule of three; 3 shouts, 3 horn blasts, or 3 whistles.\n\n• At a restaurant do you order what you know is great, or do you try something new? Do you make what you know will sell or try something new? Do you keep dating new folks or try to commit to someone you already met? The optimal balance for exploring new things vs exploiting them once found is: 1/3. Spend 1/3 of your time on exploring and 2/3 time on deepening. It is harder to devote time to exploring as you age because it seems unproductive, but aim for 1/3.\n\n• Actual great opportunities do not have “Great Opportunities” in the subject line.\n\n• When introduced to someone make eye contact and count to 4. You’ll both remember each other.\n\n• Take note if you find yourself wondering “Where is my good knife? Or, where is my good pen?” That means you have bad ones. Get rid of those.\n\n• When you are stuck, explain your problem to others. Often simply laying out a problem will present a solution. Make “explaining the problem” part of your troubleshooting process.\n\n• When buying a garden hose, an extension cord, or a ladder, get one substantially longer than you think you need. It’ll be the right size.\n\n• Dont bother fighting the old; just build the new.\n\n• Your group can achieve great things way beyond your means simply by showing people that they are appreciated.\n\n• When someone tells you about the peak year of human history, the period of time when things were good before things went downhill, it will always be the years of when they were 10 years old — which is the peak of any human’s existence.\n\n• You are as big as the things that make you angry.\n\n• When speaking to an audience it’s better to fix your gaze on a few people than to “spray” your gaze across the room. Your eyes telegraph to others whether you really believe what you are saying.\n\n• Habit is far more dependable than inspiration. Make progress by making habits. Dont focus on getting into shape. Focus on becoming the kind of person who never misses a workout.\n\n• When negotiating, dont aim for a bigger piece of the pie; aim to create a bigger pie.\n\n• If you repeated what you did today 365 more times will you be where you want to be next year?\n\n• You see only 2% of another person, and they see only 2% of you. Attune yourselves to the hidden 98%.\n\n• Your time and space are limited. Remove, give away, throw out things in your life that dont spark joy any longer in order to make room for those that do.\n\n• Our descendants will achieve things that will amaze us, yet a portion of what they will create could have been made with today’s materials and tools if we had had the imagination. Think bigger.\n\n• For a great payoff be especially curious about the things you are not interested in.\n\n• Focus on directions rather than destinations. Who knows their destiny? But maintain the right direction and you’ll arrive at where you want to go.\n\n• Every breakthrough is at first laughable and ridiculous. In fact if it did not start out laughable and ridiculous, it is not a breakthrough.\n\n• If you loan someone $20 and you never see them again because they are avoiding paying you back, that makes it worth $20.\n\n• Copying others is a good way to start. Copying yourself is a disappointing way to end.\n\n• The best time to negotiate your salary for a new job is the moment AFTER they say they want you, and not before. Then it becomes a game of chicken for each side to name an amount first, but it is to your advantage to get them to give a number before you do.\n\n• Rather than steering your life to avoid surprises, aim directly for them.\n\n• Dont purchase extra insurance if you are renting a car with a credit card.\n\n• If your opinions on one subject can be predicted from your opinions on another, you may be in the grip of an ideology. When you truly think for yourself your conclusions will not be predictable.\n\n• Aim to die broke. Give to your beneficiaries before you die; it’s more fun and useful. Spend it all. Your last check should go to the funeral home and it should bounce.\n\n• The chief prevention against getting old is to remain astonished.\n\n\\[[German](https://www.mokita.de/blog/2022/05/06/103-ratschlaege-die-kevin-kelly-gerne-gewusst-haette-auf-deutsch/) translation\\] \\[Other translations wanted\\]\n","n":0.02}}},{"i":607,"$":{"0":{"v":"100+ Book Summaries High Quality, Detailed, Nonfiction (Free)","n":0.354},"1":{"v":"\n# [100+ Book Summaries: High Quality, Detailed, Nonfiction (FREE)](https://www.sloww.co/book-summaries/)\n\nSloww is your go-to book summary website for the highest quality and most detailed free book summaries anywhere online.

Big Thank You.” — Sarah G, Sloww reader*\n\n---\n\n**Page Contents:** *Click a link here to jump to a section below*\n\n-   **[Most Popular Book Summaries](https://www.sloww.co/#popular-book-summaries)**\n\n-   [Book Summaries by Category](https://www.sloww.co/#book-summaries-categories)**:**\n    -   [Intentional Living Book Summaries](https://www.sloww.co/#intentional-living-book-summaries)\n    -   [Art of Living & Human Potential Book Summaries](https://www.sloww.co/#art-of-living-book-summaries)\n    -   [Meaning & Life Purpose Book Summaries](https://www.sloww.co/#meaning-purpose-book-summaries)\n    -   [Spirituality Book Summaries](https://www.sloww.co/#spirituality-book-summaries)\n    -   [Psychology & Philosophy Book Summaries](https://www.sloww.co/#psychology-philosophy-book-summaries)\n    -   [Life & Work Optimization Book Summaries](https://www.sloww.co/#life-work-book-summaries)\n\n---\n\nWhat makes Sloww summaries the most useful book summaries in the world?\n\n-   **Author Quotes:** I always use the author’s original words—*not* filtered by my mind. Watch out for book “summaries” that are only or mostly in the reader’s words—you’re essentially playing the “telephone game” with these (you’re reading the reader’s mind, not the author’s words).\n\n-   **Key Themes:** I group similar quotes into key themes, so you get the gist of the main themes from a book *and* see direct examples of original author quotes that support the themes. Key themes can then be synthesized *across* books to make you more of a interdisciplinary generalist.\n\n-   **Visual Formatting:** I do a lot of extra work to provide intuitive visual organization. This is rarely seen in other book summaries online that are often long pages of unformatted text or bullet points. I use highlighting, bolding, visuals, and infographics to bring my book summaries to life.\n\n-   **Appropriate Length:** There are far too many short summaries out there that only give you bits and pieces of a book. My summaries are “as long as they need to be” depending on the quality of the book. I offer both free summaries and 🔒Premium summaries (further distilled and more actionable). Here are some examples of how much fluff I cut out of a book to produce my summaries (free summaries cut ~90% out of a full book on average; 🔒Premium summaries then cut the free summaries in half):\n\n![Sloww Book Summary Comparison](inbox/assets/Sloww%20Book%20Summary%20Comparison.png)\n\n![Sloww Book Summaries](inbox/assets/Sloww%20Book%20Summaries.jpeg)\n\n*“Thank you especially for the book summaries.

Previously known as Ethereal, Wireshark is widely used by industries and educational institutes. Wireshark has a “live capturing” ability for packet investigation, and the output data is stored in XML, CSV, PostScript, and plain text documents. This program is the most famous network protocol analyzer, and its purpose is to see what is happening around your network. Wireshark provides all the details you need to know about the packets in movement in your network.\n\n## Features\n\nWireshark contains several useful features, the foremost of which are listed below:\n\n- Inspecting thousands of protocols\n- New protocols being added with every update\n- Live-capturing of protocols with offline analysis\n- Three-way handshake\n- Maximum portability: runs on Solaris, Linux, Windows, MAC OS X, FreeBSD, and more\n- Analyzing VoIP protocols\n- Reads data from many platforms, i.e., Wi-Fi, Ethernet, HDLC, ATM, USB, Bluetooth, Frame Relay, Token Ring, and more\n- Results can be saved in CSV, XML, PostScript, and plain text documents\n- Reads and write a wide variety of captured file formats\n\n## Lab\n\n- Wireshark captures data from network interface.\n  - You specify the interface where you want to capture data from.\n- When you want to capture data from a network that is not yours(you're not part of) you need a network interface card that can be put into monitor(or promiscuous) mode.\n\n1.

With Wget, you can download files using HTTP, HTTPS, and FTP protocols. Wget provides a number of options allowing you to download multiple files, resume downloads, limit the bandwidth, recursive downloads, download in the background, mirror a website, and much more.\n\nThe `wget` utility expressions take the following form:\n\n```sh\nwget [options] [url]\n```\n\nCopy\n\n- `options` - The [Wget options](https://linux.die.net/man/1/wget)\n- `url` - URL of the file or directory you want to download or synchronize.\n\n## How to Download a File with `wget`\n\nIn its simplest form, when used without any option, `wget` will download the resource specified in the [url] to the current directory.\n\nIn the following example, we are downloading the Linux kernel tar archive:\n\n```\nwget https://cdn.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v4.x/linux-4.17.2.tar.xz\n```\n\nDuring the download, `wget` shows the progress bar alongside the file name, file size, download speed, and the estimated time to complete the download. Once the download is complete, you can find the downloaded file in your current working directory .\n\nTo turn off the output, use the `-q` option.\nIf the file already exists, `wget` will add `.N` (number) at the end of the file name.\n\n## Saving the Downloaded File Under Different Name\n\nTo save the downloaded file under a different name, pass the `-O` option followed by the chosen name:\n\n```\nwget -O latest-hugo.zip https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/archive/master.zip\n```\n\n## Downloading a File to a Specific Directory\n\nBy default, `wget` will save the downloaded file in the current working directory. To save the file to a specific location, use the `-P` option:\n\n```\nwget -P /mnt/iso http://mirrors.mit.edu/centos/7/isos/x86_64/CentOS-7-x86_64-Minimal-1804.iso\n```\n\nThe command above tells `wget` to save the CentOS 7 iso file to the `/mnt/iso` directory.\n\n## Limiting the Download Speed\n\nTo limit the download speed, use the `--limit-rate` option. By default, the speed is measured in bytes/second. Append `k` for kilobytes, `m` for megabytes, and `g` for gigabytes.\n\nThe following command will download the Go binary and limit the download speed to 1MB:\n\n```\nwget --limit-rate=1m https://dl.google.com/go/go1.10.3.linux-amd64.tar.gz\n```\n\nThis option is useful when you don’t want `wget` to consume all the available bandwidth.\n\n## Resuming a Download\n\nYou can resume a download using the `-c` option. This is useful if your connection drops during a download of a large file, and instead of starting the download from scratch, you can continue the previous one.\n\nIn the following example, we are resuming the download of the Ubuntu 18.04 iso file:\n\n```\nwget -c http://releases.ubuntu.com/18.04/ubuntu-18.04-live-server-amd64.iso\n```\n\nIf the remote server does not support resuming downloads, `wget` will start the download from the beginning and overwrite the existing file.\n\n## Downloading in Background\n\nTo download in the background, use the `-b` option. In the following example, we are downloading the OpenSuse iso file in the background:\n\n```\nwget -b https://download.opensuse.org/tumbleweed/iso/openSUSE-Tumbleweed-DVD-x86_64-Current.iso\n```\n\nBy default, the output is redirected to `wget-log` file in the current directory. To watch the status of the download, use the [`tail`](https://linuxize.com/post/linux-head-command/) command:\n\n```\ntail -f wget-log\n```\n\n## Changing the Wget User-Agent\n\nSometimes when downloading a file, the remote server may be set to block the Wget User-Agent. In situations like this, to emulate a different browser, pass the `-U` option.\n\n```\nwget --user-agent=\"Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:60.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/60.0\" http://wget-forbidden.com/\n```\n\nThe command above will emulate Firefox 60 requesting the page from `wget-forbidden.com`\n\n## Downloading Multiple Files\n\nIf you want to download multiple files at once, use the `-i` option followed by the path to a local or external file containing a list of the URLs to be downloaded. Each URL needs to be on a separate line.\n\nThe following example shows how to download the Arch Linux, Debian, and Fedora iso files using the URLs specified in the `linux-distros.txt` file:\n\n```\nwget -i linux-distros.txt\n```\n\nlinux-distros.txt\n\n```txt\nhttp://mirrors.edge.kernel.org/archlinux/iso/2018.06.01/archlinux-2018.06.01-x86_64.iso\nhttps://cdimage.debian.org/debian-cd/current/amd64/iso-cd/debian-9.4.0-amd64-netinst.iso\nhttps://download.fedoraproject.org/pub/fedora/linux/releases/28/Server/x86_64/iso/Fedora-Server-dvd-x86_64-28-1.1.iso\n```\n\nCopy\n\nIf you specify `-` as a filename, URLs will be read from the standard input.\n\n## Downloading via FTP\n\nTo download a file from a password-protected FTP server, specify the username and password as shown below:\n\n```\nwget --ftp-user=FTP_USERNAME --ftp-password=FTP_PASSWORD ftp://ftp.example.com/filename.tar.gz\n```\n\n## Creating a Mirror of a Website\n\nTo create a mirror of a website with `wget`, use the `-m` option. This will create a complete local copy of the website by following and downloading all internal links as well as the website resources (JavaScript, CSS, Images).\n\n```\nwget -m https://example.com\n```\n\nIf you want to use the downloaded website for local browsing, you will need to pass a few extra arguments to the command above.\n\n```\nwget -m -k -p https://example.com\n```\n\nThe `-k` option will cause `wget` to convert the links in the downloaded documents to make them suitable for local viewing. The `-p` option will tell `wget` to download all necessary files for displaying the HTML page.\n\nor\n\n```\nwget --mirror --convert-links --adjust-extension --page-requisites --no-parent https://example.com\n\n# or\n\nwget -mKEpnp https://example.com\n\n```\n\n## Skipping Certificate Check\n\nIf you want to download a file over HTTPS from a host that has an invalid SSL certificate, use the `--no-check-certificate` option:\n\n```\nwget --no-check-certificate https://domain-with-invalid-ss.com\n```\n\n## Downloading to the Standard Output\n\nIn the following example, `wget` will quietly ( flag `-q`) download and output the latest WordPress version to stdout ( flag `-O -`) and pipe it to the `tar` utility, which will extract the archive to the `/var/www` directory.\n\n```\nwget -q -O - \"http://wordpress.org/latest.tar.gz\" | tar -xzf - -C /var/www\n```\n\n> via - [Wget Command in Linux with Examples | Linuxize](https://linuxize.com/post/wget-command-examples/)\n","n":0.037}}},{"i":630,"$":{"0":{"v":"Wget Hacks","n":0.707},"1":{"v":"\n- Areas: [[devlog.linux]]\n\n---\n\n**Change user-agent**\n\nMe: [[devlog.wget]] [URL]\nServer: 403 FORBIDDEN\nMe: wget -U Mozilla/5.0 [URL]\nServer: 200 OK\n\nVia - [(Ryan Castellucci on Twitter](https://twitter.com/ryancdotorg/status/1539168895059349504)\n\n[`wget -U Googlebot` is like multipass for rate limiting](https://twitter.com/ryancdotorg/status/1539168895059349504)\n","n":0.192}}},{"i":631,"$":{"0":{"v":"Website Monitoring","n":0.707},"1":{"v":"\n- Related: [[devlog.python]]\n\n---\n\n1.

The client is almost always a web browser or a mobile application. Depending on the setup, a web server can store one or more websites.\n\nThis type of server only delivers static HTML content, such as:\n\n- Documents\n- Images\n- Videos\n- Fonts\n\nTraditionally, web servers do not deal with dynamic content or server-side programming. Web servers accept and fulfill Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP or HTTPS) requests only. Optionally, you can add components for dealing with dynamic content.\n\n## Application Server\n\nAn application server is a software framework that delivers content and assets for a client application. Clients include web-based applications, browsers, and mobile apps.\n\nApplication servers provide clients with access to business logic. Through business logic, an app server transforms data into dynamic content and enables the functionality of the application. Examples of dynamic content are:\n\n- A transaction result\n- Decision support\n- Real-time analytics\n\nThis server type is the main link between a client and server-side code. Typical tasks of an application server include:\n\n- Transaction management\n- Security\n- Dependency injection (DI)\n- Concurrency\n\nApplication servers also handle processes such as clustering, fail-over, and load-balancing.\n\n## Comparisons\n\nWhen web browsers became the main application clients, the line between app and web servers got blurry.\n\nMost web servers have plugins for scripting languages (ASP, JSP, PHP, Perl, etc.) that enable dynamic content generation. For example, if we add a .NET plugin to an IIS environment, we can connect the web server to server-side code and serve clients with dynamic content.\n\nThere is an overlap on the app server’s side too. Many application servers offer web server capabilities and use HTTP as a primary protocol.\n\nBecause of the overlap in use cases and technology, most popular servers are hybrids of the two types. A hybrid solution that combines server capabilities ensures optimal system speed and functionality.\n\n- **Web servers and application servers have one thing in common – they need a dedicated server to run the software.**\n- **For an inexpensive way of hosting a static website, consider using** [[devlog.Object Storage]].\n\n| **Web Servers**                                              | **Point of Comparison** | **Application Servers**                                                                                            |\n| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| Hosts websites and responds to simple web requests           | Main purpose            | Hosts applications and delivers complex interactions through business logic                                        |\n| Only delivers static content via HTML                        | Type of content         | Delivers static and dynamic content                                                                                |\n| HTTP/HTTPS protocols only                                    | Protocols               | The client-server interaction can occur via several protocols, including HTTP/HTTPS                                |\n| No                                                           | Application connection  | Yes                                                                                                                |\n| Has access to a static database                              | Database connection     | Has access to the application database                                                                             |\n| Web browsers                                                 | Typical client          | Serves web and mobile applications, and web browsers                                                               |\n| Does not support multi-threading                             | Multi-threading         | Uses multi-threading to process multiple requests in parallel                                                      |\n| Facilitates traffic that does not consume a lot of resources | Resource consumption    | Facilitates resource-intensive processes                                                                           |\n| Web container only                                           | Containers              | Web container (Servlets, JSP, JSF, web services), EJB container (JTA), Application Client container (DI, security) |\n| Very low                                                     | Capacity                | High                                                                                                               |\n| A hypertext document that displays information on a browser  | Interaction result      | Files that contain data and serve a specific purpose depending on the client needs                                 |\n\nVia - [Web Server vs. Application Server: What Are the Differences?](https://phoenixnap.com/blog/web-server-vs-application-server)\n","n":0.043}}},{"i":633,"$":{"0":{"v":"Web Development","n":0.707}}},{"i":634,"$":{"0":{"v":"wc","n":1},"1":{"v":"\n- Areas: [[devlog.linux]]\n\n---\n\nOn Linux and Unix-like operating systems, the wc command allows you to count the number of lines, words, characters, and bytes of each given file or standard input and print the result.\n\nThe options below allow you to select which counts are printed.\n\n- `-l`, –lines - Print the number of lines.\n- `-w,` –words - Print the number of words.\n- `-m`, –chars - Print the number of characters.\n- `-c`, –bytes - Print the number of bytes.\n- `-L`, –max-line-length - Print the length of the longest line.\n\nExample:\n\n`wc /etc/passwd`\n\nOutput: `48 83 2825 /etc/passwd` where 48 lines, 83 words and 2825 characters\n","n":0.101}}},{"i":635,"$":{"0":{"v":"watch","n":1},"1":{"v":"\n- Areas: [[devlog.linux]]\n\n---\n\n- `watch` is used to run any arbitrary command at regular intervals and displays the output of the command on the terminal window.\n- It is useful when you have to execute a command repeatedly and watch the command output change over time.

Infact in most distros, vi is [[devlog.Aliases]] to vim. It stands for \"Vi Improved\".\n\nThere are a lot of enhancements above vi: multi level undo, multiple windows and buffers, syntax highlighting, command line editing, file name completion, a complete help system, visual selection, and others.\n\n### `vim` is a modal editor, it has two primary \"modes\":\n\nCOMMAND mode and INSERT mode.\n\nIn COMMAND mode, you execute commands (like undo, redo, find and replace, quit, etc.). In INSERT mode, you type text. There is a third mode, VISUAL mode, that is used to highlight and edit text in bulk.\n\n- To go into INSERT mode from COMMAND mode, you type `i`.\n- To go back to COMMAND mode, you type the `esc` key.\n\n---\n\n- <span class=\"underline\">vim starts out in COMMAND mode</span>.\n- <span class=\"underline\">Note that all commands mentioned below (except for arrow keys) only work in COMMAND mode.</span>\n\n### Entering INSERT Mode\n\nWhen you are ready to enter text, you should switch to INSERT mode. There are a few ways to do this:\n\n- `i` enter INSERT mode before the cursor\n- `I` enter INSERT mode at the start of the current line\n- `a` enter INSERT mode appending after the cursor\n- `A` enter INSERT mode appending to the end of the current line\n- `o` enter INSERT mode on a new line below the current line\n- `O` enter INSERT mode on a new line above the current line\n\nThen, just type as normal to enter text. You can use the arrow keys to navigate, or switch back to COMMAND mode.\n\n### Last Line Mode\n\nYou can enter the Last Line Mode from the COMMAND mode((`esc`) using `:` colon key, after pressing the colon, you can do all sorts of things from this mode.\n\n### Highlighting text\n\nIf you want to highlight multiple lines or particular words in a line, you can do so in VISUAL mode. There are three different visual modes:\n\n- `v` enters character-wise visual mode to highlight one character at a time.\n- `V` enters line-wise visual mode to highlight entire lines at a time.\n- `ctrl-v` enters block-wise visual mode to highlight over rows and columns, etc.\n\nOnce you enter these modes by typing these in COMMAND mode, you can use the keyboard navigation (e.g., `hjkl` or `w` or `b`) to highlight text). Then you can batch delete (`d`), yank (`y`), or paste (`p`) whatever is highlighted. To exit VISUAL mode, use `esc`.\n\nVISUAL mode is also useful for adjusting indent to a batch of text. For example, if you wanted to reduce the indent of a set of lines, you can enter block-wise visual mode (`ctrl-v`) to select a vertical column of indents (using keyboard navigation), and then batch delete with `d`. To increase the indent of a set of lines, enter block-wise visual mode and select a vertical column, and then batch insert at the beginning of this block with `I`, type in your indentation, and then use `esc`. You should see all highlighted lines get the same inserted space.\n\n### Examples\n\n- `ZZ` shift zz to save and quit quickly.\n- `gg` to move to the start of the file.\n- `/` followed by the string and press enter to forward search,  \n  `n` to find the next occurrence and `N` to search in opposite direction, just like [[less]]\n- `G` or `Shift + g` to move you to the bottom of the file.\n- `?` followed by the string and press enter to backward search.\n- Press `*` to find the next occurance of the word under the cursor.\n- Press `#` to find the previous occurance of the word under the cursor.\n\n---\n\n- `u` undo the last action\n- `U` undo all recent changes made to the current line\n- `ctrl-r` redo\n- `:e!` undo till the last saved version of the file\n\n---\n\n- `:w myprogram.c` save the current changes to a file.

This is the first one which takes the data from the upper layer i.e. the application layer, and then splits it into smaller packets called the segments and dispenses it to the network layer for further delivery to the destination host.\n\nIt ensures that the data received at host end will be in the same order in which it was transmitted. It provides an end to end supply of the data segments of both inter and intra sub-networks. For an end to end communication over the networks, all devices are equipped with a Transport service access point (TSAP) and are also branded as port numbers.\n\nA host will recognize its peer host at the remote network by its port number.\n\n**Error Detection & Control**: Error checking is provided in this layer because of the following two reasons:\n\nEven if no errors are introduced when a segment is moving over a link, it can be possible for errors to be introduced when a segment is stored in the router’s memory (for queuing). The data link layer is not able to detect an error in this scenario.\n\nThere is no assurance that all the links between the source and destination will provide error scrutiny. One of the links may be using a link layer protocol which doesn’t offer the desired outcomes.\n\n### The methods used for error check and control are CRC (cyclic redundancy check) and checksum.\n\n**CRC**: The concept of CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check) grounds on the binary division of the data component, as the remainder of which (CRC) is appended to the data component and sent to the receiver. The recipient divides data component by an identical divisor.\n\nIf the remainder comes up to zero then the data component is allowed to pass to forward the protocol, else, it is assumed that the data unit has been distorted in transmission and the packet is discarded.\n\n**Checksum Generator & checker**: In this method, the sender uses the checksum generator mechanism in which initially the data component is split into equal segments of n bits. Then, all the segments are added together by employing 1’s complement.\n\nLater, it complements once again, and now it turns into checksum and then is sent along with the data component.\n\n**Example**: If 16 bits is to be sent to the receiver and bits are 10000010 00101011, then the checksum that will be transmitted to the receiver will be 10000010 00101011 01010000.\n\nUpon receiving the data unit, the receiver divides it into n equal size segments. All the segments are added using 1’s complement. The result is complemented once more and If the result is zero, the data is accepted, else discarded.\n\nThis error detection & control method permits a receiver to rebuild the original data whenever it is found corrupted in transit.\n\n### Layer 4 Examples\n\n- [[devlog.TCP]]\n- [[devlog.UDP]]\n- [[devlog.WAN Accelerators]]\n- [[devlog.Load Balancer]]s\n- [[devlog.firewall]]s\n\nSee: [[devlog.tcp vs udp]]\n","n":0.043}}},{"i":671,"$":{"0":{"v":"Transparent eyeball","n":0.707},"1":{"v":"\n- Areas: [[Transcendentalism]]\n\n---\nThe **Transparent eyeball** is a philosophical metaphor originated by Ralph Waldo Emerson.

There are a number of subjects that need to be covered in order to ensure you are ready for back-to-back questions.\n\nSome positions require [Hadoop](https://hadoop.apache.org/), others [SQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL). Some roles require understanding statistics, while still others require heavy amounts of system design.\n\nWe have gathered many of the resources that we have used to study and get jobs at companies in the FAANG family as well as other major tech companies. We have yet to find one that requires you to know anything about Hadoop during the interview, so that has not been included in this study guide.\n\nWe recommend asking the recruiter if you aren’t sure which type of interview you will be facing. Some companies are very good at keeping interviews consistent, but even then, teams can deviate depending on what they are looking for. Here are some examples of what we have noticed about some companies' data engineering interviews.\n\n**Amazon —** SQL- and database-design heavy as well as general ETL design. Surprisingly, no Python.\n\n**Netflix —**SQL- and code-heavy, with the expectation that you can not only write SQL and code but can optimize them.\n\n> _“They asked about SQL queries to find time difference between two events given certain condition. ” — Netflix data engineer on Glassdoor_\n\n**Expedia** — Big Data questions, like what is Spark and RDDs, as well as SQL and Python.\n\nDue to this variance, we’ve created a checklist to keep track of what subject areas you have already studied and what you still need to cover: [data engineering study checklist](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GOO4s1NcxCR8a44F0XnsErz5rYDxNbHAHznu4pJMRkw/edit#gid=0).\n\nAlso, I recently created a [video guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lloOlnSzSs&t=1s) to walk through the data engineering interview study guide.\n\nLet’s get started with SQL.\n\nSQL\n===\n\nAs a data engineer, it is almost inevitable that you will get some SQL questions. As someone who has participated in many interviews for a lot of top tech companies, like Amazon and Capital One, I know that they usually follow some similar patterns.\n\nTypically there will be at least one question that requires an aggregation with a filter, another that requires a few joins, and then one that requires a subquery. Along with that, there might be a few curveball questions that require self-joins, recursions, and analytic functions. So let’s look at a couple of concepts that are good to cover.\n\nPre-video SQL problems\n----------------------\n\nThese first few problems will help you gauge where you are on different concepts. That way you can take notes on the study guide, and go back and review what you feel you were not comfortable with.\n\n1.  [262\\.

First, we recommend designing a relational database, then thinking about how you would design an ETL and DW that rely on that relational DB.\n\n**Note:** In addition, we have found it very common that interviewers will base their interview questions on your design. So think about some of the questions you could answer with your DB and list them.\n\nDesign a database/ETL and DW for a:\n\n*   dating app\n*   bicycle rental service\n*   music streaming app\n*   job search website\n*   Udemy-like website\n\nThese are just a few ideas. We hope they help you have a clearer idea of what you can practice modeling and designing. Take some time to think about how users interact with these websites before getting started.\n\nProgramming Problems\n====================\n\nData engineers do a significant amount of programming in their daily life. There are several specific languages data engineers use. Python is arguably the most common.\n\nIf the role requires a lot of Hadoop work, then [Java](https://www.java.com/en/) is also a useful language to have. There are a few other useful languages, like Java and [PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/overview?view=powershell-7.1) (if you work at a Microsoft shop).\n\nThere are two types of questions we have experienced. Some interviewers will ask you more operational questions. Others will ask classic algorithm and data structure questions.\n\nOperational Programming Problems\n================================\n\nOperational interview questions are harder to prep for. There are no “classic” interview questions here. However, they are also often easier to figure out on the spot. Algorithm interview questions usually have some sort of trick. Like the balanced brackets problem: If you don’t know you need to use queues, it will be very difficult to get to the correct answer.\n\nOperational problems, however, will be more focused on workflows and business processes. So as long as you are good at walking through real problems, this should be easier. Here are some problems that are great for prepping. We find it is helpful to know how to use arrays and dictionaries. Beyond that, there isn’t too much more required.\n\n1.

We have listed eight LeetCode problems that vary in difficulty. Try these out and try to gauge yourself on how long it takes you, as well as how many hints you needed. If you are following along with the study guide, then note this down. At the end of this list are a few more questions.

Funny thing was, a person commented about the video and pointed back to my original data engineering study guide. Just by happenstance!\n\nSmall world.\n\nThey also added another section. In this case, they added [Spark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Spark). So for those of you out there needing to study for Spark, here is what Paul Russel added to the checklist. What would you add?\n\n[Architecture Overview & Use Cases](https://www.toptal.com/spark/introduction-to-apache-spark)\n\n[Spark by Examples (tutorial documentation)](https://sparkbyexamples.com/spark/)\n\n[PySpark Syntax Cheat Sheet](https://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.datacamp.com/blog_assets/PySpark_SQL_Cheat_Sheet_Python.pdf)\n\n\n\n","n":0.026}}},{"i":683,"$":{"0":{"v":"TFTP","n":1},"1":{"v":"\n- Trivial File Transfer Protocol ([[devlog.FTP]]), operates on [[Port 69]]\n- Transmits files in both directions of a [[devlog.Client]]-[[devlog.Server]] application.\n- Used for booting an operating system from a local area network, file server.\n- It is also used to request configuration files from [[devlog.router]]s and [[devlog.Switch]]es\n- Doesn't provide user authentication or directory visibility.\n- It is essentially a stripped down version of [[devlog.FTP]]\n","n":0.129}}},{"i":684,"$":{"0":{"v":"Tez","n":1},"1":{"v":"\nTez is an in-memory [[devlog.mapreduce]] on top of which [[HQL]] sits.\n","n":0.302}}},{"i":685,"$":{"0":{"v":"Test the Theory","n":0.577},"1":{"v":"\n- Select the most likely problem cause.\n- Determine how to best test the most likely problem cause, if applicable, backup data and configurations.\n- Test the theory in a sandboxed environment.\n- In case of inability to test problem cause, escalate.\n\nWhen testing a theory\n\n- Change one thing at a time.\n- Determine the root cause\n\nUpon theory failure\n\n- Establish a new theory\n- Escalate the problem\n","n":0.128}}},{"i":686,"$":{"0":{"v":"Terraform","n":1},"1":{"v":"\nTerraform is an open source infrastructure as code ([[devlog.IaC]]) software tool that allows DevOps engineers to programmatically provision the physical resources an application requires to run. To create and configure infrastructure . NOT for installing stuff on the server, just for provisioning.\n\nIt is a universal [[devlog.IaC]] tool, works with different cloud providers and technologies.\n\n![[devlog.IaC]]\n\nIt uses declarative syntax(as opposed to imperative syntax) to define what the end result looks like and it will figure out how to provision the infrastructure.\n\n- It is also helps in automating the infrastructure as it changes over time.\n- To replicate the same infrastructure in different environments(Dev, Staging, Production)\n\nUsing Terraform, your infrastructure is idempotent. You don't need to remember the current state, you only define your desired state. Since, you use declarative syntax, you don't define the steps like you would if you were using imperative syntax.\n\n## [[devlog.ansible]] VS Terraform\n\n- Terraform is mainly an infrastructure provisioning tool.\n- Ansible is mainly used for configuring infrastructure.\n- Its a common practice to combine both to get the best of both.\n\n## Terraform Architecture\n\nIt has 2 components:\n\n### Core\n\n- Takes 2 input sources\n  - Terraform Config\n  - State(current state of the infrastructure)\n- Core takes the input from the config and state and compares what needs to be changed and what is already there as per the config and state.\n- It essentially **creates the execution plan** that the providers use.\n\n### Providers\n\n- This can be providers for the specifc technology(AWS, GCP, Azure, OpenStack, other [[devlog.IaaS]])\n- It can also has providers for higher level technologies([[devlog.kubernetes]], other [[devlog.PaaS]] or even [[devlog.SaaS]])\n- It has over 100 providers and over 1000 resources.\n\n## Example config files\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/zubayr/image/upload/v1655346903/wiki/lazrvzt8omhhkplp3xwt.png)\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/zubayr/image/upload/v1655346973/wiki/tcxkbpv4dyrx9yjtnufu.png)\n\nWe only define a few attributes in the configuration file, the rest or defaults are handled by terraform. Auto-generated.\n\n## Terraform commands for different stages\n\n- `refresh` - query infra provider to get current state.\n- `plan` - create an execution plan, just preview no real changes.\n- `apply` - executes the plan(it does all the above steps, like refresh and plan and then apply).\n- `destroy` - destroys the resources/infrastructure in the right order, does cleaning up of the resources. Reverting. It works similar to `apply`, it checks the state and makes a plan for what needs to be done.\n\n## Providers\n\n- They're basically a piece of code that knows how to talk to a specific technology. To connect to it and start using. Interact.\n- Expose resources for specific technology(AWS, GCP, Azure, OpenStack, other [[devlog.IaaS]])\n- Responsible for understanding API of that platform.\n- [Browse Providers | Terraform Registry](https://registry.terraform.io/browse/providers)\n- Providers don't come with installation of terraform, they need to be installed separately.\n- Once provider is installed using the `terraform init` command, the complete API of that provider is available.\n- You get 2 components from the Providers\n  - Resources\n  - Data Sources\n\n## Resources\n\n- You can use the `resource` keyword in your `.tf` file using the resource's name.\n- The name of a resource follows the convention of `<provider>_<resource>`.\n- You can assign the resource to a variable by providing a variable name right after the resource name.\n- Each resource block describes one or more infrastructure objects. As referred to as \"attributes\" or \"parameters\".\n- When you're creating a resource for another resource that doesn't yet exist, you can reference the object.\n\n## Data Sources\n\n- Allows data to be fetched for use in the `.tf` files.\n- Query existing resources/components.\n- It follows the same convention as the resource names.\n\n## Terraform Commands\n\n- `terraform init` - initialize the working directory. Installs the providers defined in the config file.\n- `terraform apply` - apply the changes using the configuration file in the working directory.\n- `terraform apply -auto-approve` - to skip the approve prompt.\n- `terraform destroy` - if `-target` is not specified, it'll destroy all of the resources defined in the configuration file.\n\n## Examples\n\n### Creating an EC2 instance with Terraform\n\n```json\nprovider \"aws\" {\n  region = \"us-east-1\"\n  access_key = \"AKIAJX7X7X7X7X7X7X7X\"\n  secret_key = \"secret\"\n  // don't hard code the above values use Environment variables\n}\n\nresource \"aws_vpc\" \"test_vpc\" {\n  cidr_block = \"10.0.0.0/16\"\n}\n\nresource \"aws_subnet\" \"test-subnet-1\" {\n  vpc_id = aws_vpc.test_vpc.id\n  cidr_block = \"10.0.10.0/24\"\n  availability_zone = \"us-east-1a\"\n}\n\n// if you wanted to create a subnet for an existing vpc, you could hard code the ID of your vpc OR use data sources\n\ndata \"aws_vpc\" \"existing_vpc\" {\n  //  use filter or attributes to filter through of your existing vpc/resource\n  default = true\n}\n\nresource \"aws_subnet\" \"test-subnet-2\" {\n  vpc_id = data.existing_vpc.id\n  cidr_block = \"172.31.48.0/20\"\n  availability_zone = \"us-east-1a\"\n```\n\n### Changing resources\n\nAdding names using `tags:` keyword and using the reserved `Name` attribute for defining a name.\nTo remove something, you'd simply remove it from the config file.\n\n```json\nprovider \"aws\" {\n  region = \"us-east-1\"\n  access_key = \"AKIAJX7X7X7X7X7X7X7X\"\n  secret_key = \"secret\"\n  // don't hard code the above values\n}\n\nresource \"aws_vpc\" \"test_vpc\" {\n  cidr_block = \"10.0.0.0/16\"\n  tags = {\n    Name: \"development-vpc\",\n    vpc_env: \"dev\"\n  }\n}\n\nresource \"aws_subnet\" \"test-subnet-1\" {\n  vpc_id = aws_vpc.test_vpc.id\n  cidr_block = \"10.0.10.0/24\"\n  availability_zone = \"us-east-1a\"\n    tags = {\n    Name: \"development-subnet\"\n  }\n}\n\n// if you wanted to create a subnet for an existing vpc, you could hard code the ID of your vpc OR use data sources\n\ndata \"aws_vpc\" \"existing_vpc\" {\n  //  use filter or attributes to filter through of your existing vpc/resource\n  default = true\n}\n\nresource \"aws_subnet\" \"test-subnet-2\" {\n  vpc_id = data.existing_vpc.id\n  cidr_block = \"172.31.48.0/20\"\n  availability_zone = \"us-east-1a\"\n```\n\n### Removing/Destroying resources\n\n1. Remove the resource from Terraform config file and `terraform apply`. (Recommended)\n2. `terraform destroy -target resource_type.resource_name`\n\n## State\n\n`terraform.tfstate` - it is a `json` file where Terraform stores the state of your managed infrastructure. It generates this file on your first `terraform apply`.\n\n`terraform.tfstate.backup` is the file that is created to store the backup of the previous state.\n\nNeither of these files should be updated manually and must be updated as a result of executing `terraform` commands.\n\nTerraform has commands to access the information in the state file.\n\n- `terraform state` - list all subcommands of `state`.\n- `terraform state list` - list all resources in the state.\n- `terraform state mv` - move an item in the state.\n- `terraform state show` - show a resource in the state. Useful for checking the values of the attributes that were autogenerated by Terraform.\n\n## Output\n\nWe can define what value we want Terraform to spit at the end of applying of the configuration from the resources. Output values are like function's return values.\n\n```json\noutput \"dev-vpc-id\" {\n  value = aws_vpc.development_vpc.id\n}\n\noutput \"dev-subnet-id\" {\n  value = aws_subnet.dev-subnet-1.id\n}\n```\n\n## Variables\n\nYou use variables inside of the configuration file. variables = input variables. If you don't want to hard code values you can pass them as parameters. Define and reference it. Input variables are like function arguments. They're defined using `variable` keyword. Makes it easier to replicate, parameterize, and reuse the same configuration over different environments. You'd have different `.tfvars` files for different environments.\n\n```json\nvariable \"subnet_cidr_block\" {\n  description = \"CIDR block for the subnet\"\n  default = \"10.0.30.0/24\"\n  type = string\n}\n\nresource \"aws_vpc\" \"development_vpc\" {\n  vpc_id = aws_vpc.test_vpc.id\n  cidr_block = var.subnet_cidr_block\n  availability_zone = \"us-east-1a\"\n  tags: {\n    Name: \"subnet-1-dev\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThere are three ways to pass values to input variables.\n\n1. Prompt when `terraform apply` is run.\n2. Define the value when running apply command\n   - `terraform apply -var \"subnet_cidr_block=10.0.30.0/24`\n3. Use a `.tfvars` to pass the values from a file. (Recommended)\n   - `terraform.tfvars` - this is a file that contains the (keys)values for the variables. (If you don't pass a file name, it'll look for this file)\n   - Use the `-var-file` flag to pass the file name.\n     - `terraform apply -var-file terraform-dev.tfvars`\n\n### Default values\n\nDefault value will kick in if terraform cannot find the value in the `.tfvars` file or as a command line argument. A default value makes the variable optional.\n\n### Type constraints\n\n`type` specifies what value types the variable can accept.\n\nUsing `list`:\n\n```json\nvariable \"cidr_blocks\" {\n  description = \"CIDR blocks list\"\n  type = list(string)\n}\n\nresource \"aws_subnut\" \"dev-subnet-1\" {\n  vpc_id = aws_vpc.test_vpc.id\n  cidr_block = var.cidr_blocks[1]\n  availability_zone = \"us-east-1a\"\n  tags: {\n    Name: \"subnet-1-dev\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nYou can also use objects or lists of objects. You can also validate the type of the value for the objects as well.\n\n```json\n// terraform-dev.tfvars\n\ncidr_blocks = [\n  {cidr_block = \"10.0.10.0/16\", name = \"dev_vpc\"},\n  {cidr_block = \"10.0.20.0/24, name = \"dev_subnet\"}\n]\n```\n\n```json\nvariable \"cidr_blocks\" {\n  description = \"CIDR blocks list and Name tag\"\n  type = list(object({\n    cidr_block: string\n    name: string\n  }))\n}\n\nresource \"aws_vpc\" \"test_vpc\" {\n  cidr_block = var.cidr_blocks[0].cidr_block\n  tags = {\n    Name: var.cidr_blocks[0].name\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Environment Variables\n\nEnvironment variables are defined by the providers for you to use.\n\n1. Use `export` to set the environment variable, it will be available only for the current shell session.\n\n   `export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<secret_access_key>`\n   `export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<access_key_id>`\n\n2. Set the environment variable in the `~/.aws/credentials` to be available globally, you may also use `aws configure` to set the credentials.\n\n### TF Environment Variable\n\nDefine your own custom variables and use `.tf_var` to pass them to the Terraform configuration as global environment variables.\n\n- Define the variable - `export TF_VAR_my_custom_variable=\"my_custom_value\"`\n- To use it, reference it without the `TF_VAR_` prefix.\n\n```json\nvariable \"my_custom_variable\" {}\n\nresource \"aws_subnut\" \"dev-subnet-1\" {\n  vpc_id = aws_vpc.test_vpc.id\n  cidr_block = var.cidr_blocks[1]\n  availability_zone = var.my_custom_variable\n  tags: {\n    Name: \"subnet-1-dev\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n![[devlog.terraform aws]]\n\n## Provisioners\n\nProvisioners can be used to model specific actions on the local machine running the Terraform Core or on a remote machine to prepare servers or other infrastructure objects. But HashiCorp states in its documentation that they should be used as the last solution!\n\n### Null resource\n\nFrom the Terraform docs:\n\nThe null provider is a rather-unusual provider that has constructs that intentionally do nothing. This may sound strange, and indeed these constructs do not need to be used in most cases, but they can be useful in various situations to help orchestrate tricky behavior or work around limitations.\n\nThe documentation of each feature of this provider, accessible via the navigation, gives examples of situations where these constructs may prove useful.\n\nUsage of the null provider can make a Terraform configuration harder to understand. While it can be useful in certain cases, it should be applied with care and other solutions preferred when available.\n\nThe Terraform null_resourceis commonly used to run scripts on a specified trigger.\n\n### Connection attribute\n\n`remote-exec` provisioners require connection credentials to function, even though `remote-exec` might be defined in a resource block that is a server, it doesn't connect to it unless explicity defined.\n\n### `remote-exec` provisioner\n\nThis provisioner invokes a script on the newly created resource. it’s similar to connecting to the resource and running a bash or a command in the terminal.\n\nIt can be used inside the Terraform resource object and in that case it will be invoked once the resource is created, or it can be used inside a null resource which is my prefered approche as it separates this non terraform behavior from the real terraform behavior.\n\n- Invokes script on a remote resource after it is created\n  - `inline` - list of commands\n  - `script` - path to script\n\n```terraform\nresource \"null_resource\" \"configure-vm\" {\n\n  connection {\n      type = \"ssh\"\n      user = var.username\n      host = var.ip_address\n      private_key = var.tls_private_key\n    }\n\n  ## Copy files to VM :\n  provisioner \"file\" {\n    source = \"/Users/zakariaelbazi/Documents/GitHub/zackk8s/kubernetes\" #TODO move to variables.\n    destination = \"/home/${var.username}\"\n  }\n\n  ## install & start minikube\n  provisioner \"remote-exec\" {\n    inline = [\n      \"sudo chmod +x /home/${var.username}/kubernetes/install_minikube.sh\",\n      \"sh /home/${var.username}/kubernetes/install_minikube.sh\",\n      \"./minikube start --driver=docker\"\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\n\n> Note that you can not pass any arguments to the script or command, so the best way is to use file provisioner to copy the files to the resources and then invoke them with the remote-exec provisioner like I did above for my script that installs minikube on the azure-vm.\n\n> An other thing to pay attention to is that by default, provisioners that fail will also cause the Terraform apply to fail. To avoid that, the on_failure can be used.\n\n```terraform\nresource \"null_resource\" \"configure-vm\" {\n    .........\n    ..........\n\n  provisioner \"remote-exec\" {\n    inline = [\n      \"sudo chmod +x /home/${var.username}/kubernetes/install_minikube.sh\",\n      \"sh /home/${var.username}/kubernetes/install_minikube.sh\",\n      \"./minikube start --driver=docker\"\n    ]\n    on_failure = continue #or fail\n\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, I am using inline which is a series of command, the on_failure will apply only to the final command in the list !\n\n### `local-exec` provisioner\n\nTechnically, this one is very similar to the one before in terms of behavior or use but it works in the local machine ruining Terraform. It invokes a script or a command on local once the resource it’s declared in is created.\n\nIt’s the only provisioner that doesn’t need any ssh or winrm connection details as it runs locally.\n\n## Resources\n\n- [What is terraform provisioner? | Jhooq](https://jhooq.com/terraform-provisioner/)\n- [All you need to know about Terraform provisioners and why you should avoid them. | AWS Tip](https://awstip.com/all-you-need-to-know-about-terraform-provisioners-and-why-you-should-avoid-them-22b5ef8d2db2)\n- [Terraform Tutorial: Drift Detection Strategies](https://www.trendmicro.com/ru_ru/devops/22/c/terraform-tutorial-drift-detection-strategies.html)\n","n":0.022}}},{"i":687,"$":{"0":{"v":"Terraform in AWS","n":0.577},"1":{"v":"\nIn this lab, we'll do:\n\n- Provision an [[devlog.AWS EC2]] instance on AWS.\n- Run a simple [[devlog.nginx]] [[devlog.docker]] container on it.\n- We'll do this on AWS infrastructure using Terraform (obviously).\n\n## Steps\n\n1.

Units are categorized by the type of resource they represent and they are defined with files known as unit files. The type of each unit can be inferred from the suffix on the end of the file.\n\nAlthough it is technically correct to classify a unit as a service, in systemd, units tend to be more abstract and often comprised of resource pools, filesystem mounts, network protocols, devices, and native Linux services.\n\nUnits are defined in a file known as a Unit file. Systemd can manage unit files from any location, but their main location is `/etc/systemd/system` directory. Unit files in this directory are mainly user-provided. Compared to other locations, the systemd manager will assign higher precedence to unit files within the above directory.\n\n```\nsudo systemctl list-units\n\n# or\n\nsudo systemctl list-units --all\n\n# to show all installed unit files\n\nsudo systemctl list-unit-files\n```\n\nThe following are the unit files found in systemd.\n\n- **.service** – Service unit files define how systemd manages a service. They typically end in .service extension. Service unit files describe how to start, stop, reload and restart a service and the dependencies required to manage the service.\n- **.target** – Target units provide synchronization points to other services during startup.\n- **.slice** – slice unit files encode information about systemd slice units. Slice units are part of the Linux control group tree that allows resource allocation and restriction to processes associated with a slice. You can learn more about systemd resource control [here](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.resource-control.html).\n- **.socket** – A socket unit file encodes information about network socket, IPC, or a file system FIFO buffer controlled and managed for systemd, which systemd uses for socket-based activation.\n- **.device** – Device unit configurations define a device unit as exposed in the sysfs/udev device tree.\n- **.timer** – Timer units define a timer managed and controlled by systemd for scheduled activation.\n- **.snapshot** – Snapshot unit files allow rollback of the current state of the system after making changes. We create them using the systemd snapshot command.\n- **.swap** – Swap units encode information about swap space, such as the device name or path of the swap space.\n- **.mount** – mount unit files encode information about mount points in the system managed by systemd.\n- **.automount** – these are unit files that define mount points that are automatically mounted.\n\n## systemctl\n\n`systemctl` is a Linux command-line utility used to control and manage systemd and services. You can think of Systemctl as a control interface for Systemd init service, allowing you to communicate with systemd and perform operations.\n\nSystemctl is a successor of Init.d system; it contains libraries, daemons, and utilities you can use to manage services in the Linux system.\n\nTo start a `systemd` service, executing instructions in the service’s unit file, use the `start` command. If you are running as a non-root user, you will have to use `sudo` since this will affect the state of the operating system:\n\n```\nsudo systemctl start application.service\n\n# or you can skip .service\n\nsudo systemctl start application\n```\n\nTo stop/restart\n\n```\nsudo systemctl stop application\nsudo systemctl restart application\n```\n\nrestart vs reload\n\n`restart` will terminate the service in question and restart it; `reload` will only reload the configuration file of the service. Not all services might support `reload` in which case you can use `reload-or-restart`\n\nTo check status\n\n```\nsudo systemctl status application\n```\n\nTo enable or disable\n\n`enable` will enable a service to start automatically at boot time vice versa for `disable`\ncheck with `is-enabled` (these settings only take place at boot time and won’t effect current session)\n\n```\nsudo systemctl enable application\n```\n\nTo see a unit’s dependency tree\n\n```\nsystemctl list-dependencies sshd.service\n```\n\nMasking\n\n`systemd` also has the ability to mark a unit as *completely* unstartable, automatically or manually, by linking it to `/dev/null`. This is called masking the unit, and is possible with the `mask` command:\n\nThis will prevent the Nginx service from being started, automatically or manually, for as long as it is masked.\n\n```\nsudo systemctl mask nginx.service\n\n# to unmask\n\nsudo systemctl unmask nginx.service\n```\n\n## References\n\n- [How To Use Systemctl to Manage Systemd Services and Units | DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-systemctl-to-manage-systemd-services-and-units)\n- [How to Use Systemctl Utility in Linux](https://linuxhint.com/systemctl-utility-linux/)\n- [Systemd Units Explained with Types and States](https://www.computernetworkingnotes.com/linux-tutorials/systemd-units-explained-with-types-and-states.html)\n","n":0.033}}},{"i":698,"$":{"0":{"v":"systemd-networkd","n":1},"1":{"v":"\n- Areas: [[areas.networking]],[[devlog.linux]]\n\n---\n\n[[systemd-networkd]] is a system [[devlog.daemon]] that manages network configurations.

Subnetting provides network administrators with several benefits. It provides extra flexibility, makes more efficient use of network address utilization, and contains broadcast traffic because a broadcast will not cross a router.\n\nSubnets are under local administration. As such, the outside world sees an organization as a single network, and has no detailed knowledge of the organization's internal network structure.\n\nA given network address can be broken up into many subnetworks. For example, 172.16.1.0, 172.16.2.0, 172.16.3.0, and 172.16.4.0 are all subnets of the Class B network 171.16.0.0.\n\n**IP Subnet Mask:**\n\nA subnet address is created by \"borrowing\" bits from the host field and designating them as the subnet field. The number of borrowed bits is variable and specified by the subnet mask.\n\nThe following figure shows how bits are \"borrowed\" from the host address field to create the subnet address field:\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/zubayr/image/upload/v1655736057/wiki/hnvqgvajvxuug5jct9aj.png)\n\nSubnet masks use the same format and representation technique as network mask format, the subnet mask has binary 1s in all bits specifying the network and subnetwork fields, and binary 0s in all bits specifying the host field.\n\nThe following figure shows a sample subnet mask:\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/zubayr/image/upload/v1655736067/wiki/cz15tvvibn0kjpyo4zki.png)\n\nVia - [Basic IP Addressing and Troubleshooting Guide](http://penta2.ufrgs.br/trouble/ts_ip.htm)\n\n- Each subnet inside a [[devlog.vpc]] has to have a different set of [[devlog.ip address]]es.\n\n# Classes of IP Address\n\n- Default subnet mask is assigned by first octet\n  - Classful Mask if using default subnet mask\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/zubayr/image/upload/v1656592872/wiki/duckdmgbrvvo2am5hazc.png)\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/zubayr/image/upload/v1656593725/wiki/kbyzrh9dfdqxoigaldkq.png)\n\nThe subnet mask does not actually contain network or host portion of an IPv4 address, it simply tells where to look for these portions in a given IPv4 address.\n\n**Notice that 127 is skipped between Class A and Class B, it is a reserved block for the loopback address(`127.0.0.1`).**\n\n## Subnet mask\n\nFinally understanding what subnet mask is\n\nFor example take two IP addresses and tell if they both can communicate(predict that they’re part of the same network - or share same netowkr ID)\n\n`10.10.10.1` and `10.10.20.16`\n\nCan you tell if they are both part of the same network? You simply CANNOT\n\nWhy? Because how is it going to assume what part of this IP tells you the network ID and which portion tells you the host ?\n\nFor that we need a subnet mask\n\nFor the above IPs lets assume `255.0.0.0` is the subnet mask\n\nWhich means(refer to the chart above) that they’re part of the same network and do not need a router to communicate, a switch will do the trick.\n\nWe can use Class C subnet mask for Class A and Class B IP address but cannot use Class A and Class B subnet mask for Class C IP address.\n\nSome more examples:\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/zubayr/image/upload/v1656594629/wiki/hk9tpoxztalbecnkahgl.png)\n\n## Drawbacks of Classful Addressing\n\n- **Lack of internal address flexibility**: Large organizations are assigned \"monolithic\" blocks of addresses that don't match well with the structure of the internal network.\n- **Inefficient use of address space**: The existence of only three block sizes(classes A,B and C) leads to wastage of limited IP address space.\n- **Proliferation of router table entries**: As the internet grows, more entries are required for routers to handle the routing if IP datagrams, which causes performance problems for routers.

The configuration file specifies encryption options, authentication options, file locations, logging, and various other parameters.\n- Edit `sshd_config` for making any changes to the server and restart the server.\n- Backup the file before making changes to it.\n- Change default port from `Port 22` to a random port number\n  - This is security by obscurity\n  - Not the best security practice but highly recommended\n  - Hackers could scan for specific Port 22 or they could also scan all the ports but in case of [[devlog.ssh]] most of the time the attacks are not targeted but automated.\n  - Don’t forget to make the changes to the firewall rules to allow the newly defined port.\n- Disable direct root login through [[devlog.ssh]]\n  - `#PermitRootLogin prohibit-password` is default; which means you can login as root using a different method such as [[Public Key Authentication]] but it is recommended to change it to `#PermitRootLogin no`\n- Disable password authentication\n- List the users that have ssh access under `AllowUsers`\n- Filter ssh access at the firewall level, limit the access of ssh from a predefined list of source [[devlog.ip address]]ess\n- An example rule is defined below\n- `iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 2278 -s 2.2.4.5 -j ACCEPT`\n- Drop access for all the other IP Addresses\n- `iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 2278 -j DROP`\n- Use SSH protocol version 2\n- Set idle timeout interval\n  - `ClientAlive`\n- `MaxAuthTries` max number of authentication attempts\n- `MaxStartups` max number of concurrent unauthenticated connections to the SSH daemon\n- `LoginGraceTime` the server disconnects after this time if the user has not successfully logged in.\n- Always use latest version of [[devlog.ssh]]\n","n":0.054}}},{"i":718,"$":{"0":{"v":"SSH","n":1},"1":{"v":"\n- Areas: [[devlog.linux]],[[areas.networking]]\n\n---\n\n- Secure Shell or Secure Socket Shell, operates on [[Port 22]]\n- Cryptographic network protocol for operating network services securely, even over an unsecured network.\n- Best known for remote login to computer systems by users.\n\n---\n\n- The SSH protocol is used for:\n  - Secure Remote Management of Servers, Routers and other Networking Devies.\n  - Network File Copy: [[devlog.rsync]], [[devlog.sftp]], [[devlog.sc]] If you suspect a firewall issue then use [[devlog.ufw]], [[winscp]]\n  - Tunneling, SSH Port Forwarding\n- [[devlog.SSHD]] is the SSH server [[devlog.daemon]], `ssh` or `putty` are the clients\n\n- To check status of ssh\n  - `sudo systemctl status ssh`\n- Service Stop, Restart, Start: `sudo systemctl [start|restart|stop] ssh`\n- Enable, Disable auto booting: `sudo systemctl [enable|disable] ssh`\n\n- Server config file: `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`\n- Client Config file: `/etc/ssh/ssh_config`\n\n### Check status\n\n- `systemctl status ssh` or `systemctl status sshd`(for CentOS)\n- `ps -ef | grep sshd` can\n- `systemctl is-enabled ssh` to start at boot\n\n### Troubleshooting ssh\n\n### Connecting to ssh server\n\n- Using [[devlog.ping]] to test connection between either ssh server or client\n  - `ping IPAddr` see: [[Troubleshooting for connectivity issues]]\n- Connecting using a client(OpenSSH)\n  - `ssh username@serverIPAddr` or `ssh -l username IPAddr`\n  - The username used should exist on the server, not on the client\n- The first time whena client is connecting to an ssh server, the client uses a cryptographic fingerprint to identify the server and prevent possible man in the middle attacks in the future.\n- The host key is randomly generated when the ssh server is set up and is used to identify the server you're connecting to.\n- It will be saved on the client in the file called [[ssh-known_hosts|/.ssh/known_hosts]]\n- You'll be prompted to enter the user's password, press enter to start your connection.\n- To exit, run `exit` or `Ctrl + D`\n\n### Options\n\n- To use a port other than the default one(Port 22) use `-p` followed by the port number.\n- ssh client has it's own configuration file under ``/etc/ssh/ssh_config`\n\ncheck out: [putty](https://www.putty.org/)\n\n### Securing SSH with Key Authentication\n\n- Use [[devlog.ssh-keygen]] to for Public Key Authentication\n- Disable password authentication of the remote machine\n  - `vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config`\n  - Make `PasswordAuthentication no`\n  - `systemctl restart ssh`\n\n### Troubleshooting [[devlog.ssh]]\n\nThe first to check is that the ssh daemon is running on the server machine:\n`systemctl status ssh`\n\nIf you get a `WARNING: REMOTE HOST IDENTIFICATION HAS CHANGED!` message on the client when trying to connect/autheticate ssh server, double check that you're connecting to the right server.

Such key pairs are used for automating logins, single sign-on, and for authenticating hosts.\n\nThe [[devlog.SSH]] protocol uses public key cryptography for authenticating hosts and users. The authentication keys, called SSH keys, are created using the keygen program.\n\nSSH supports several public key algorithms for authentication keys. These include:\n\nrsa - an old algorithm based on the difficulty of factoring large numbers. A key size of at least 2048 bits is recommended for RSA; 4096 bits is better. RSA is getting old and significant advances are being made in factoring. Choosing a different algorithm may be advisable. It is quite possible the RSA algorithm will become practically breakable in the foreseeable future. All SSH clients support this algorithm.\n\ndsa - an old US government Digital Signature Algorithm. It is based on the difficulty of computing discrete logarithms. A key size of 1024 would normally be used with it. DSA in its original form is no longer recommended.\n\necdsa - a new Digital Signature Algorithm standarized by the US government, using elliptic curves. This is probably a good algorithm for current applications. Only three key sizes are supported: 256, 384, and 521 (sic!) bits. We would recommend always using it with 521 bits, since the keys are still small and probably more secure than the smaller keys (even though they should be safe as well). Most SSH clients now support this algorithm.\n\ned25519 - this is a new algorithm added in OpenSSH. Support for it in clients is not yet universal.

If a third party were to gain physical access to your disk, they could, using advanced techniques, access the data you thought you had deleted.\n\nThe analogy is that of a paper shredder. If you crumple up a piece of paper and throw it in the trash can, a third party could come along, root through your trash, and find your discarded documents. If you want to destroy the document, it's best to use a paper shredder. Or burn it, I suppose, but that's not always practical in a typical office.\n\nThe way that shred accomplishes this type of destruction digitally is to overwrite (over and over, repeatedly, as many times as you specify) the data you want to destroy, replacing it with other (usually random) data.

[SRC]... DEST\nLocal to Remote: rsync [OPTION]... [SRC]... [USER@]HOST:DEST\nRemote to Local: rsync [OPTION]... [USER@]HOST:SRC... [DEST]\n```\n\nCopy\n\n- `OPTION` - The rsync options .\n- `SRC` - Source directory.\n- `DEST` - Destination directory.\n- `USER` - Remote username.\n- `HOST` - Remote hostname or IP Address.\n\n`rsync` provides a number of options that control how the command behaves. The most widely used options are:\n\n- `-a`, `--archive`, archive mode, equivalent to `-rlptgoD`. This option tells `rsync` to syncs directories recursively, transfer special and block devices, preserve symbolic links, modification times, groups, ownership, and permissions.\n- `-z`, `--compress`. This option forces `rsync` to compresses the data as it is sent to the destination machine. Use this option only if the connection to the remote machine is slow.\n- `-P`, equivalent to `--partial --progress`. When this option is used, `rsync` shows a progress bar during the transfer and keeps the partially transferred files. It is useful when transferring large files over slow or unstable network connections.\n- `--delete`. When this option is used, `rsync` deletes extraneous files from the destination location. It is useful for mirroring.\n- `-q`, `--quiet`. Use this option if you want to suppress non-error messages.\n- `-e`. This option allows you to choose a different remote shell. By default, `rsync` is configured to use ssh.\n\n## Basic Rsync Usage\n\nThe most basic use case of `rsync` is to copy a single file from one to another local location. Here is an example:\n\n```bash\nrsync -a /etc/ ~/etc_backup/\n```\n\nThe user running the command must have read permissions on the source location and write permissions on the destination.\n\nOmitting the filename from the destination location copies the file with the current name. If you want to save the file under a different name, specify the new name on the destination part:\n\n```\nrsync -a /opt/filename.zip /tmp/newfilename.zip\n```\n\nThe real power of `rsync` comes when synchronizing directories. The example below shows how to create a local backup of website files:\n\n```\nrsync -a /var/www/domain.com/public_html/ /var/www/domain.com/public_html_backup/\n```\n\nIf the destination directory doesn’t exist, `rsync` will create it.\n\nIt is worth mentioning that `rsync` gives different treatment to the source directories with a trailing slash (`/`). If the source directory has a trailing slash, the command will copy only the directory contents to the destination directory. When the trailing slash is omitted, `rsync` copies the source directory inside the destination directory.\n\n---\n\n## Using rsync Over the Network\n\nWhen using `rsync` to [transfer data remotely , it must be installed on both the source and the destination machine. The new versions of `rsync` are configured to use SSH as default remote shell.\n\nIn the following example, we are transferring a directory from a local to a remote machine:\n\n```\nrsync -a /opt/media/ remote_user@remote_host_or_ip:/opt/media/\n```\n\nor\n\n```\nrsync -av -e ssh /etc/ remote_user@remote_host_or_ip:~/etc_bacup/\n```\n\nTo transfer data from a remote to a local machine, use the remote location as a source:\n\n```\nrsync -a remote_user@remote_host_or_ip:/opt/media/ /opt/media/\n```\n\nIf SSH on the remote host is listening on a port other than the default 22 , specify the port using the `-e` option:\n\n```\nrsync -a -e \"ssh -p 2322\" /opt/media/ remote_user@remote_host_or_ip:/opt/media/\n```\n\nThere are two options to exclude files and directories. The first option is to use the `--exclude` argument and specify the files and directories you want to exclude on the command line.\n\nWhen excluding files or directories , you need to use their relative paths to the source location.\n\nIn the following example shows how exclude the `node_modules` and `tmp` directories:\n\n```\nrsync -a --exclude=node_modules --exclude=tmp /src_directory/ /dst_directory/\n```\n\nThe second option is to use the `--exclude-from` option and specify the files and directories you want to exclude in a file.\n\n```\nrsync -a --exclude-from='/exclude-file.txt' /src_directory/ /dst_directory/\n```\n\n```bash\n$ cat exclude-file.txt\nnode_modules\ntmp\n```\n\n> via - [Rsync Command in Linux with Examples | Linuxize](https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-use-rsync-for-local-and-remote-data-transfer-and-synchronization/)\n","n":0.043}}},{"i":775,"$":{"0":{"v":"Routing","n":1}}},{"i":776,"$":{"0":{"v":"router","n":1},"1":{"v":"\n- Areas: [[areas.networking]]\n\n---\n\nA device that connects two different networks together and intelligently forwards traffic to and from a network based on its logical address([[devlog.ip address]])\n\nModern routers use [[devlog.ip address]]es to determine the routing of network traffic, although there are other routing protocols as well.\n\n---\n\n- Layer 3 device used to connect multiple networks together\n- Making forwarding decisions based on logical network address information\n  - Such as using [[devlog.ip address]]es ([[devlog.IPv4]] or [[devlog.IPv6]])\n- Routers are typically more feature rich and support a broader range of interface types than multilayer [[devlog.Switch]]es\n\n---\n\n- Each port is a separate [[devlog.collision domains]]\n- Each port is a separate [[devlog.broadcast domain]]\n\n**How a router routes a packet:**\n\nWhen a router receives a packet, it makes a routing decision based on the destination address portion of the packet. It then looks up the destination address in its routing table. If the destination address is within a known network/subnetwork, the router forwards the packet to the next hop gateway for that destination network/subnetwork. Once the packet leaves the router, it is the responsibility of the next hop gateway to forward the packet to its final destination. If the router does not have the destination network in its routing table, it may forward the packet to a predetermined default gateway if configured and let the default gateway handle getting the packet to the destination network or it will drop the packet and inform the sending host that the network is not reachable.\n\nThe routing table is a list of networks that router knows about. It can learn these routes by 3 means: a routing protocol such as; [[devlog.RIP]], [[devlog.IGRP]], and [[devlog.OSPF]], a static route that has been manually been set by a network administrator, or by being directly connected to that network on one of its interfaces.\n\nThe routing table will contain many pieces of information about the learned network, but the main information is the network address and the next hop gateway.\n\nThe network address can be either a full class network address or a subnetwork address, depending on the netmask being used. The next hop gateway is the ip address of the gateway to hand off the outbound packet to.\n\nKeep in mind that all of the routers must know of a way to reach each other. The receiving host must have a path to get back to the sending host in order for data to pass.\n\nVia — [Basic IP Addressing and Troubleshooting Guide](http://penta2.ufrgs.br/trouble/ts_ip.htm)\n","n":0.05}}},{"i":777,"$":{"0":{"v":"route","n":1},"1":{"v":"\n- Areas: [[areas.networking]]\n\n---\n\n`route` is use to work with the IP/kernel routing table.

It collects metrics and stores it with which we can make dashboards and alerts.\n\nIt was created to monitor highly dynamic container environments like [[devlog.kubernetes]], [[devlog.docker swarm]] etc. It can also be used in traditional non-container infrastructure.\n\nTypically you've many servers that run containerized applications, hundreds of different processes running on that infrastructure which are all interconnected. To get insights on this infrastructure such as errors, latency etc.\n\nTo make it easier for us to debug these system and fix them without much downtime, we'll use something like Prometheus, that will constantly monitor all the services/resources, alerts the maintainers as soon as anything goes wrong. **In fact it can identify problems before they even occur** and notify the maintainers so the failures can be prevented.\n\n# Prometheus Architecture\n\n## Prometheus Server\n\nThis is what does the actual monitoring.\n\nIt constitutes of three components:\n\n- Time Series DB - stores metrics data, no. of exceptions.\n- Data Retrieval Worker - responsible for pulling metrics from applications/services/servers - target resources and pushing them to the Time series DB.\n- HTTP Server - Accepts PromQL queries for that stored data. Web server API is used to display data in a dashboard or UI - either Prometheus UI or Grafana etc.\n\n## Targets and Metrics\n\nWhat does Prometheus monitor?\n\nIt can be an entire [[devlog.Linux]] server, Windows server, a standalone [[devlog.apache]] server, single application or service. These are called as **Targets**.\n\nEach target has unit of monitoring:\n\n- For a Linux server it could be current CPU usage, memory usage, disk space usage.\n- For an application - No. of exceptions, requests, request duration.\n\nA unit that you'd want to monitor for a target is called a **Metric**.\nThey're what gets stored in Prometheus DB component. Prometheus defines human readable, text based format for the metrics. Metric entries or data has `TYPE` and `HELP` attributes to increase it's readability.\n\n`HELP` is basically description of the metric.\n`TYPE` is one of three metric types:\n\n- `Counter`\n  - For how many times x happened\n- `Gauge`\n  - For a metric that can go up and down. Eg: Current value of x now?\n- `Histogram`\n  - For tracking how long something took or how big something was(like the size of a request).\n\n## Getting metrics\n\nHow does Prometheus collect metrics from the targets?\n\n**Pulling**\n\nYour application(regardless of technology) will have to expose a metrics HTTP endpoint and Prometheus will scrape from the endpoint. By default is is: `hostaddress/metrics`.\n\nData available in the `/metrics` endpoint should be in the correct format that Prometheus understands.\n\nSome servers expose Prometheus endpoints by default so you don't really have to do extra work for it. But many services don't have native Prometheus endpoints in which case you'd need an **Exporter**\n\n**Exporter**\n\nIt basically a script/service that fetches metrics from your target and converts them in format Prometheus understands and exposes it's converted data at it's own `/metrics` endpoint where Prometheus can scrape them.\n\nPrometheus has a list of exporters for different services like [[devlog.MySQL]], [[devlog.Elasticsearch]], [[devlog.Linux]] servers, [[Build Tools|devlog.build automation]], Cloud Platforms and so on.\n\nIf you want to monitor a Linux server, see: [Monitoring Linux host metrics with the Node Exporter | Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/docs/guides/node-exporter/)\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/zubayr/image/upload/v1656150261/wiki/xfe8c37gmzogdoin3wtx.png)\n\nExporters are also available as Docker images. SO\n\nIf you want to monitor [[devlog.mysql]] container in a [[devlog.kubernetes]] cluster, you can deploy  a sidecar container of MySQL exporter that will run inside the pod with MySQL container, connect to it and start sending MySQL metrics for Prometheus and making them available at it’s own `/metrics` endpoint.\n\n**Monitoring  your own applications?**\n\n- How many requests your applications are receiving.\n- How many exceptions are occurring.\n- How many server resources your application is using.\n\n For this you can use Client Libraries for different languages using which you can expose `/metrics` endpoint for metrics that are relevant to you.\n[Client libraries | Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/docs/instrumenting/clientlibs/)\n\n\n## Push based VS Pull based\n\nMost monitoring systems like [[devlog.AWS CloudWatch]] or [[devlog.New Relic]] etc use a Push system. Applications and servers are responsible for pushing their metric data to a centralized collection platform of that monitoring tool.\n\nIn large microservices based system this approach can create a bottleneck for your infrastructure as all of these microservices constantly make push request to your monitoring tool thus flooding your system.\n\nPlus, you’ll also need to install additional software(daemons) on each of your targets to push the metrics to the monitoring server. In contrast with Prometheus which only requires a scraping endpoint.\n\nMultiple Prometheus instances can collect/pull metrics. Using pull, Prometheus can easily detect whether a service is up and running or not.\n\nPushing can be ambiguous when checking if the service is up or not when compared to pull mechanism. Because there can be many reasons for a push request to fail. \n\n**Pushing**\n\nPushgateway can be utilized when a target only runs for a short time.\nEg: A batch job, scheduled job etc. For such jobs, Prometheus offers Pushgateway component. So these services can push metrics directly to Prometheus DB.\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/zubayr/image/upload/v1655885235/wiki/yguspabejdgcr4qbzegm.png)\n\n## Configuring Prometheus \n\n`prometheus.yaml` file contains all the info needed for Prometheus to know what(targets) to scrape and when(intervals). \n\nPrometheus then uses **Service Discovery**  mechanism to find those target endpoints.\n\nYou can find the sample config files with default values which comes with your first Prometheus installation.\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/zubayr/image/upload/v1656153062/wiki/p2l9ubydx8h1viv4pafn.png)\n\nUnder `global:` you define how often Prometheus will scrape it’s targets.\n\nRules are for aggregating metric values or creating alerts when conditions \nare met.\n\n`scrape_configs:` define what resources Prometheus monitors; essentially targets. You can define your own jobs and default values for each job(overwrite global interval values).\n\nSince Prometheus has it’s own `/metrics` endpoint, it can monitor it’s own health.\n\n## AlertManager\n\nHow does Prometheus trigger alerts that are defined by rules in `prometheus.yaml` and who receives these alerts?\n\nPrometheus has a component called AlertManger that is responsible for firing alerts via different channels (Emails, Slack channel or other notification clients).\n\nPrometheus server will read alert rules and if the conditions under rules is met an alert is fired. \n\n## Prometheus Data Storage \n\nWhere does Prometheus store all the data that it collects/aggregates? How can other systems use this data?\n\nPrometheus stores metric data on disks, includes Local on disk **Time Series DB** but also optionally integrates with remote storage system. It is stored in custom Time Series format. Because of this you cannot directly write this data on a relational DB or something else.\n\nOnce collected, Prometheus lets you query the data through it’s server API using it’s query language called **PromQL**.\n\n## PromQL\n\nYou can use Prometheus dashboard UI to ask Prometheus server via PromQL to for example show the status of a target right now.\n\nOr use more powerful data visualization tools like **Grafana** to display the data which uses PromQL under the hood to get data out of Prometheus .\n\nExample PromQL query to:\n\nQuery all HTTP status codes except `4xx` ones\n\n```sql\nhttp_requests_total{status!~\"4..\"}\n```\n\nThis query does some subquery:\n\nReturns the 5 minute rate of the _http_requests_total_ metric for the past 30 minutes.\n\n```sql\nrate(http_requests_total[5m]) [30m:]\n```\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/zubayr/image/upload/v1656153983/wiki/qu5c4x2hrwuozqeqebxy.png)\n\n## Sailent Characteristics of Prometheus \n\nIt is designed to be reliable even when other systems have an outage so you can diagnose the problems and fix them.\n\nEach Prometheus server is standalone and self-contained. It doesn’t depend on network storage or other remote services. It is meant to be still working when other parts of the infrastructure are broken.\n\nIt doesn’t require extensive setup needed.\n\n**Drawbacks:**\n\nIt can be difficult to scale, when you have hundreds of servers that you want to use multiple Prometheus instances for aggregation of metrics setting them up can get complicated.\n\nA workaround this would be to increase the capacity of your Prometheus server, limit the number of metrics Prometheus collects from applications.\n\n## Prometheus Federation\n\nTo scale monitoring with scalable cloud apps.\n\nPrometheus Federation allows one Prometheus server to scrape data from another Prometheus server. This will allow you to scale your Prometheus setup with your multi-node applications.\n\n## Prometheus with Docker & Kubernetes \n\nIt is fully compatible with both.\n\nPrometheus components are available as Docker images and therefore can be deployed on Kubernetes or other container environments.\n\nIt provides monitoring of K8s Cluster Node Resource out of the box! Once deployed on K8s, it starts gather metrics data on each Kubernetes node server without any extra configuration.\n","n":0.028}}},{"i":806,"$":{"0":{"v":"Projector","n":1},"1":{"v":"\nBrightness is measured in Lumens\n","n":0.447}}},{"i":807,"$":{"0":{"v":"process","n":1},"1":{"v":"\n- Areas: [[devlog.linux]]\n\n---\n\n- In Linux, running an instance of a program is called a **process** and it runs in its own memory space.

The PPA allows application developers and Linux users to create their own repositories to distribute software. With PPA, you can easily get newer software version or software that are not available via the official Ubuntu repositories.\n\nMind the word ‘Personal’ here. That gives the hint that this is something exclusive to a developer and is not officially endorsed by the distribution.\n\n## Why PPA? Why not DEB packages?\n\nYou may ask why should you use PPA when it involves using command line which might not be preferred by everyone. Why not just distribute a DEB package that can be installed graphically?\n\nThe answer lies in the update procedure. If you install a software using a DEB package, there is no guarantee that the installed software will be updated to a newer version when you run sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade.\n\nIt’s because the apt upgrade procedure relies on the sources.list. If there is no entry for a software, it doesn’t get the update via the standard software updater.\n\nSo does it mean software installed using DEB never gets an update? No, not really. It depends on how the package was created.\n\nSome developers automatically add an entry to the sources.list and then it is updated like a regular software. Google Chrome is one such example.\n\nSome software would notify you of availability of a new version when you try to run it. You’ll have to download the new DEB package and run it again to update the current software to a newer version. Oracle Virtual Box is an example in this case.\n\nFor the rest of the DEB packages, you’ll have to manually look for an update and this is not convenient, especially if your software is meant for beta testers. You need to add more updates frequently. This is where PPA come to the rescue.\n\n> via — [What is PPA?

Starting in 1960, it ran on the University of Illinois' ILLIAC I computer. By the late 1970s, it supported several thousand graphics terminals distributed worldwide, running on nearly a dozen different networked mainframe computers. Many modern concepts in multi-user computing were originally developed on PLATO, including forums, message boards, online testing, e-mail, chat rooms, picture languages, instant messaging, remote screen sharing, and multiplayer video games.\n\nPLATO was designed and built by the University of Illinois and functioned for four decades, offering coursework (elementary through university) to UIUC students, local schools, prison inmates, and other universities. Courses were taught in a range of subjects, including Latin, chemistry, education, music, Esperanto, and primary mathematics. The system included a number of features useful for pedagogy, including text overlaying graphics, contextual assessment of free-text answers, depending on the inclusion of keywords, and feedback designed to respond to alternative answers.Rights to market PLATO as a commercial product were licensed by Control Data Corporation (CDC), the manufacturer on whose mainframe computers the PLATO IV system was built. CDC President William Norris planned to make PLATO a force in the computer world, but found that marketing the system was not as easy as hoped. PLATO nevertheless built a strong following in certain markets, and the last production PLATO system was in use until 2006.\n\n> - via [Wikipedia](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PLATO%20(computer%20system)>)\n","n":0.065}}},{"i":823,"$":{"0":{"v":"pkill","n":1},"1":{"v":"\n- Areas: [[devlog.linux]]\n\n---\n\n`pkill` is used to send [[devlog.signal]] to the [[devlog.process]]es of a running program based on given criteria.

A Ping measures the time it takes for packets to be sent from the local host to a destination computer and back. The Ping tool measures and records the round-trip time of the packet and any losses along the way.\n\n`ping` works by sending [[devlog.ICMP]] echo request package to the specified destination [[devlog.ip address]] and waits for a reply. When the destination receives the package it will respond back with an [[devlog.ICMP]] echo reply.\n\n## Example\n\n- `ping ubuntu.com` sends echo request packets continiously\n  - `ping` will resolve domain into an address(public [[devlog.ip address]]).\n  - An IP Address can be set to multiple domain names and ping performs reverse DNS resolution asking the [[devlog.dns]] configured on the system what the domain of the IP is. The DNS Server will respond back with one domain.\n  - Add `-n` to prevent ping from doing reverse DNS lookup.\n- If you ping an IP Address that is down you'll get no response.\n- To specify number of echo request packets, `ping -c 4 ubuntu.com` will send 4 packets.\n- `icmp_seq` will the number of the packet, you can use this to detect issues with bad routing.\n- `ttl` time to leave value in the received packets and is normally the number of hops nand [[devlog.router]]s between the source and the destination.\n- `time` ping time measured in milliseconds, round trip time, `rtt`, less is better. time less than 30 excellent, 30-50 is avg, 50-100 slow, value greater than 100 probably means you cannot run real-time applications such as [[devlog.VoIP]] or Video calls.\n- By default `ping` waits for 1 second before it sends a packet, we can change this interval with `-i` option\n  - `ping -i 0.4 -c 5 google.com`\n  - Only the superuer can set this value to less than 0.2 seconds\n- `q` option to just get the summary\n- Send packets witn incremental `ttl` value to discover the path a packet takes. When a router receives a packet with `ttl` value as 1, it'll discard the packet and notify the source with an ICMP time exceeded packet. So a packet with TTL value 1 really means discovering the first router towards the destination.\n  - `ping -t 1 -c 3 -n ubuntu.com` first router\n  - `ping -t 2 -c 3 -n ubuntu.com` second router\n  - `ping -t 2 -c 3 -n ubuntu.com` third router and so on\n\n### Troubleshooting for connectivity issues\n\n- `route -n` to get default gateway\n- `ping defaultGW` if the ping doesn't work, theres a problem with LAN, maybe unauthenticated to the wireless access point or you don't have the right IP Address set.\n- ping a public IP Address on the internet, something stable like public DNS Server of Google (8.8.8.8) or public DNS Server of Cloudflare (1.1.1.1)\n  - ping 8.8.8.8\n  - ping 1.1.1.1\n  - If this doesn't work, theres an internet connectivity issue, check router configuration or check with [[devlog.ISP]].\n- ping an inter domain, something like google.com\n  - If this doesn't work, you've a DNS issue, check that you're correct [[devlog.dns]] and theres nothing filtering the packets, probably a configuration error related to DNs on your side or the DNS server is down.\n  - change the DNS Server to 8.8.8.8 and try again.\n","n":0.043}}},{"i":827,"$":{"0":{"v":"PID","n":1},"1":{"v":"\n- Areas: [[devlog.linux]]\n\n---\n\n> A PID is an acronym for the process identification number.

The subnet mask is a 32-bit logical address that is used along with the IP address by the routers to determine the location of the destination host to route the packet data.\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/zubayr/image/upload/v1656505733/wiki/g2s3ypo7rzywlll8o2m9.png)\n\n**For the above Example,** by using a subnet mask 255.255.255.0, we get to know that the network ID is 192.168.1.0 and the host address is 0.0.0.64. When a packet arrives from 192.168.1.0 subnet and has a destination address as 192.168.1.64, then the PC will receive it from the network and process it further to the next level.\n\nThus by using subnetting, the layer-3 will provide an inter-networking between the two different subnets as well.\n\nThe IP addressing is a connectionless service, thus the layer -3 provides a connectionless service. The data packets are sent over the medium without waiting for the recipient to send the acknowledgment. If the data packets which are big in size are received from the lower level to transmit, then it splits it into small packets and forwards it.\n\nAt the receiving end, it again reassembles them to the original size, thus becoming space efficient as a medium less load.","n":0.044}}},{"i":872,"$":{"0":{"v":"Network Interface Layer - TCP/IP","n":0.447},"1":{"v":"\n# Layer 1 - Network Interface Layer\n\n- Physical and electrical characteristics\n- Describes how to transmit [[devlog.bit]]s across the network\n- Determines how interface uses network medium ([[devlog.Network Cables]])\n  - [[devlog.Coax]]ial, [[devlog.Fiber Optic]], [[devlog.Twisted Pair]] copper cabling\n- Layer 1 Examples:\n  - [[devlog.Ethernet]], Token Ring, FDDI], RS-232\n","n":0.151}}},{"i":873,"$":{"0":{"v":"Network Infrastructure Devices","n":0.577},"1":{"v":"\n### Primary devices used in our networks\n\n- [[devlog.router]]\n- [[devlog.Switch]]\n- [[Layer 3 Switch]]\n\n### Devices Routers and Switches evolved from\n\n- [[devlog.Hub]]\n- [[devlog.Bridge]]\n\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr class=\"header\">\n<th>Device Type</th>\n<th style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"#Collision%20Domains\" class=\"tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves\">Collision Domains</a> Possible</th>\n<th style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"#Broadcase%20Domains\" class=\"tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-missing\">Broadcase Domains</a> Possible</th>\n<th style=\"text-align: center;\">OSI Layer of Operation</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td><a href=\"#Hub\" class=\"tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves\">Hub</a></td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">1</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">1</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td><a href=\"#Bridge\" class=\"tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves\">Bridge</a></td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">1 per port</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">1</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td><a href=\"#Switch\" class=\"tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-resolves\">Switch</a></td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">1 per port</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">1</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"even\">\n<td><a href=\"#Multilayer%20Switch\" class=\"tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-missing\">Multilayer Switch</a></td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">1 per port</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">1 per port</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">3+</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"odd\">\n<td><a href=\"#Router\" class=\"tc-tiddlylink tc-tiddlylink-missing\">Router</a></td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">1 per port</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">1 per port</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: center;\">3+</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n","n":0.098}}},{"i":874,"$":{"0":{"v":"Network Geography","n":0.707},"1":{"v":"\nDistance of the data shared across.\n\n- [[PAN]] is the smallest type of network.\n- [[devlog.LAN]] can be either [[devlog.Ethernet]] or [[devlog.Wi-Fi]] powered.\n- [[CAN]]\n- [[MAN]]\n- [[devlog.WAN]]\n\n---\n\n![](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/zubayrrr/twiki/bin/image.w6ki38tn1pn.png)\n","n":0.204}}},{"i":875,"$":{"0":{"v":"Network External Storage","n":0.577},"1":{"v":"\n- [[iSCSI]]\n- [[NAS]]\n- [[SAN]]\n","n":0.5}}},{"i":876,"$":{"0":{"v":"Network Components","n":0.707},"1":{"v":"\n- The goal of networks is to transfer data(it can be anything, video, audio etc) from one machine to another.\n- Network Components consists of:\n  - [[devlog.Client]]\n  - [[devlog.Server]]\n  - [[devlog.Hub]]\n  - [[WAP]]\n  - [[devlog.Switch]]\n  - [[devlog.router]]\n  - [[devlog.Media]]\n  - [[WAN Link]]\n","n":0.156}}},{"i":877,"$":{"0":{"v":"Network Cables","n":0.707},"1":{"v":"\n- [[devlog.Twisted Pair]]\n- [[devlog.Coax]]\n- [[devlog.Fiber Optic]]\n","n":0.408}}},{"i":878,"$":{"0":{"v":"Network Availability","n":0.707}}},{"i":879,"$":{"0":{"v":"netstat","n":1},"1":{"v":"\n- Areas: [[devlog.linux]]\n\n---\n\nNetstat is a command-line tool used by system administrators to evaluate network configuration and activity.

This is a classic reinforcement learning problem that exemplifies the exploration–exploitation tradeoff dilemma. The name comes from imagining a gambler at a row of slot machines (sometimes known as \"one-armed bandits\"), who has to decide which machines to play, how many times to play each machine and in which order to play them, and whether to continue with the current machine or try a different machine. The multi-armed bandit problem also falls into the broad category of stochastic scheduling.In the problem, each machine provides a random reward from a probability distribution specific to that machine, that is not known a-priori. The objective of the gambler is to maximize the sum of rewards earned through a sequence of lever pulls. The crucial tradeoff the gambler faces at each trial is between \"exploitation\" of the machine that has the highest expected payoff and \"exploration\" to get more information about the expected payoffs of the other machines. The trade-off between exploration and exploitation is also faced in machine learning. In practice, multi-armed bandits have been used to model problems such as managing research projects in a large organization, like a science foundation or a pharmaceutical company. In early versions of the problem, the gambler begins with no initial knowledge about the machines.Herbert Robbins in 1952, realizing the importance of the problem, constructed convergent population selection strategies in \"some aspects of the sequential design of experiments\". A theorem, the Gittins index, first published by John C.

For example, the first partition on the drive from the previous example would be `/dev/sda1`.\n\nMost times disks like USB drives are mounted automatically, if you want to mount it manually for various reasons such with different options or at a different mount point(other than `/media`)\n\n- Use [[devlog.fdisk]] to find the name of the device file.\n- Use [[dmesg]] to find the name of the device.\n- You can also use [[devlog.lsblk]] to find all block devices.\n\n```\nsudo fdisk -l\ndmesg\n```\n\nOnce you have the name of the device, you can mount it on any dir that already exists.\n\n```\nmkdir /home/user/Desktop/usb\nsudo mount /dev/sdb /home/user/Desktop/usb\n```\n\nYou can mount the same physical device on multiple mount points.\n\nMount usually automatically recognises the filesystem type but if it fails you can explicitly specify it using `-t` option.\n\n```\nsudo mount -t vfat /dev/sdb /home/user/Desktop/usb\n```\n\nUse [[devlog.umount]] to un-mount a mounted device.\n\n```\nsudo umount /home/user/Desktop/usb\n```\n\n`-o` for additional options\n\nMount in Read-Only mode\n\n```\nsudo mount -o ro /dev/sdb /home/user/Destop/usb\n```\n\nTo remount with other options or Write permissions\n\n```\nsudo mount -o rw,remount /dev/sdb /home/user/Destop/usb\n```\n\n## Mounting an ISO file\n\nStart by creating a mount point\n\n```\nmkdir ~/iso-mount\n```\n\nMount ISO using mount command\n\n```\nsudo mount /path_to_iso_file /home/user/iso-mount -o loop\n```\n\nSee also: [[devlog.gparted]]\n","n":0.046}}},{"i":890,"$":{"0":{"v":"Motherboard","n":1},"1":{"v":"\nMotherboards are circuit boards within a computer, be it a laptop or a desktop, also referred to as \"mobos\".\n\n- It is the primary digital circuit board in a computer\n- Allows internal component and external peripheral connections\n\n#### Motherboard form factor\n\n- Size\n- Orientation within the case\n- Common form factors incclude: ATX, mATX, ITX, mITX\n- Connectors/Slots: Mutliple [[CPU]] sockets(in high-end systems), \\# of PCI Express slots, \\# of [[USB]] ports.\n\n#### BIOS\n\nNewer version of BIOS is [[devlog.uefi]]\n\nBIOS is the firmware on the [[devlog.Motherboard]], firmware instruction set of a motherboard, it can be upgraded, it is burned into the chip of the motherboard.\n\nWe can configure things such as:\n\n- Power on password\n- Driver encryption\n- Secure boot(that makes sure OS hasn't been tampered with) Secure boot is specific to [[devlog.uefi]]\n\n#### CMOS\n\nCMOS is really our configuration of [[devlog.bios]]/[[devlog.uefi]] possible settings.\n\nCMOS is not firmware instruction like BIOS but our configuration of it.\n\nCMOS Battery makes sure our BIOS settings are retained even if our machine is powered off for long periods of time.\n","n":0.078}}},{"i":891,"$":{"0":{"v":"Motherboard, CPU and RAM Issues","n":0.447},"1":{"v":"\n### Common Problematic Motherboard/CPU Symptoms\n\n- POST beeps/messages/light indicators (POST stands for \"Power on self-test\")\n- Blank screen upon boot\n- Windows system lockup (BSOD - blue screen of death\n- Random reboot/shutdown\n- CPU overheating (overclocking)\n- MacOS system lockup (SPoD - spinning pinwheel of death)\n\n### Dell BIOS Beep Codes - during POST\n\n![](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/zubayrrr/twiki/bin/image.9egjs04x5eh.png)\n\n- Also look for distended capacitor in case of motherboard failure, if you see bloated capacitors, motherboard will have to be replaced.\n- Disable CPU overclocking if its overheating (you can disable it using jumper cables or from BIOS/UEFI).\n- Do a RAM test if there's a problem with RAM.\n- If you're not grounded properly there's a chance of frying the RAM - or any circuits really because of electronic static discharge.\n- If BIOS keeps resetting, consider replacing CMOS battery\n- Refer to log entries related to hardware failure.

(the `jar`, `war` that comes out of it)\n\n### groupId\n\nThe groundId is similar to a Java package, the naming convention of a groundId is to reverse the URL of the company and if it has sub projects, such as a team, that can be included in the name.\n\nWhen the projects are placed into a Maven repostiry, it'll use these names and create folders with these names, very similar to packages.\n\n### artifactId\n\nIt's kinda like a sub element of groupId and is used to name our project.\n\n### Version\n\nIf you're continiously developing a project, initially it would have the word \"SNAPSHOT\" as per the naming convention. Once we release it, it'll have a solid version number associated with it.\n\nExample: \\*`hellomaven-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar` when its being developed \\*`hellomaven-1.0.jar` once its released\n\n### Packaging\n\nThe packaging element is not directly used in the naming/locating but indirectly packaging decides what type of project is being build.\n\nUsing these coordinates we can also refer to this project as a dependency inside(`pom.xml`).\n\nthe `junit` dependency info is used to pull the `junit` dependency from the Open source central repository of Maven.\n\n## Maven Repository\n\nMaven downloads it's packages, plugins, jars from a central location on the internet, it downloads it on the fly.\n\ndefault Maven location\n\n`http://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/`\n\nOr when maven builds, it'll output the location where its hosting your repo\n\nThe artifacts are stored under a certain folder structure, it is derived from the Maven Coordinates in the `pom.xml` of your project.\n\nIt uses the `groupId` to create a repository, creates a subfolder using the `artifactId` and one more folder using the version number and the final output will be inside this version number folder.\n\nIf you want certain repoistories that are not located on the Maven central repository, you'll have to use enterprise level repository will be used to get.\n\n## Configuring Maven for publishing to Nexus\n\nAn example `pom.xml` will look something like this:\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/zubayr/image/upload/v1654647915/wiki/ps52q6penyp1thbar1pi.png)\n\nTo configure user credentials for a repository on a Maven is in the `~/.m2/settings.xml` dir in your user’s `$HOME` dir.\n\n`settings.xml` will looking something like:\n\n```xml\n<settings xmlns=\"http://maven.apache.org/SETTINGS/1.0.0\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\"\n  xsi:schemaLocation=\"http://maven.apache.org/SETTINGS/1.0.0 https://maven.apache.org/xsd/settings-1.0.0.xsd\">\n  ...\n  <servers>\n    <server>\n      <id>server001</id>\n      <username>my_login</username>\n      <password>my_password</password>\n      <privateKey>${user.home}/.ssh/id_dsa</privateKey>\n      <passphrase>some_passphrase</passphrase>\n      <filePermissions>664</filePermissions>\n      <directoryPermissions>775</directoryPermissions>\n      <configuration></configuration>\n    </server>\n  </servers>\n  ...\n</settings>\n```\n\nAll that's left is `mvn package` and then `mvn deploy` to upload the `.jar` to the [[devlog.Nexus]] repository.\n","n":0.038}}},{"i":910,"$":{"0":{"v":"Maven Scala Spark","n":0.577},"1":{"v":"\n- Areas: [[devlog.apache spark]]\n\n---\n\nInit a Scala project\n\n    mvn archetype:generate -DarchetypeGroupId=net.alchim31.maven -DarchetypeArtifactId=scala-archetype-simple -DdownloadSources=true\n\nref: <https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/net.alchim31.maven>\n\nAdd Spark dependency\n\n```\n    <dependency>\n      <groupId>org.apache.spark</groupId>\n      <artifactId>spark-sql_2.12</artifactId>\n      <version>3.1.1</version>\n    </dependency>\n```\n\n- Make sure to select JDK 8\n- Make sure to select the right version of Scala (V 2.12.6?)\n- Make sure to \"Generate Sources and Update Folders\" by right clicking inside the `pom.xml` file and from the Maven options.\n- Run your `App.scala` to check if Scala has been installed properly\n- Write your program to check if Spark is working as expected\n\n<!-- end list -->\n\n    val data = spark.sparkContext.parallelize(Seq(\"Hello World\", \"This is some text\", \"Hello text\"))\n    val map = data.flatMap(e => e.split(\" \")).map(word => (word, 1))\n    val counts = map.reduceByKey(_ + _).repartition(1)\n\n    counts.saveAsTextFile(\"wordcount\")\n\n    mvn clean package #

How does MapReduce perform this at scale when a collection of document has 50 billion words?\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zubayrrr/twiki/main/bin/image.upf9zn7wm2.png)\n\nWe can add improvements to our mapper using a combiner\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zubayrrr/twiki/main/bin/image.x9crxdaozq.png)\n\n### Working Example of Word Count\n\n`yarn jar $EXAMPLES/hadoop-mapreduce-examples-3.3.0.jar > words.txt`\n\n`yarn jar $EXAMPLES/hadoop-mapreduce-examples-3.3.0.jar wordcount wordcount/in wordcount/out`\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zubayrrr/twiki/main/bin/image.vkmgyisvvbc.png)\n\nCheck the output that was created\n\n`hdfs dfs -cat wordcount/out/part-r-00000`\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zubayrrr/twiki/main/bin/image.8velr6e7whs.png)\n\n### Calculate pi\n\n- Simple MapReduce program to run, good for quick tests.\n- The following is run on the 4-node cluster\n\n`yarn jar $EXAMPLES/hadoop-mapreduce-examples-3.3.0.jar pi 16 100000`  \n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zubayrrr/twiki/main/bin/image.ip1wh7ittuc.png)\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zubayrrr/twiki/main/bin/image.op5t2hnmh7l.png)\n\n- The following is a short test that will run on the LHM-VM (If you increase\n- the number of maps (8) or the number of guesses (1000) then the\n- application will take longer.\n\n`yarn jar $EXAMPLES/hadoop-mapreduce-examples-3.3.0.jar pi 8 1000`\n\n### The Terasort Benchmark\n\n**IMPORTANT: The test will not run on the LHM-VM.

It is often defined in a more narrow sense as the science of deductively valid inferences or of logical truths. In this sense, it is equivalent to formal logic and constitutes a formal science investigating how conclusions follow from premises in a topic-neutral way or which propositions are true only in virtue of the logical vocabulary they contain. When used as a countable noun, the term \"a logic\" refers to a logical formal system. Formal logic contrasts with informal logic, which is also part of logic when understood in the widest sense. There is no general agreement on how the two are to be distinguished. One prominent approach associates their difference with the study of arguments expressed in formal or informal languages. Another characterizes informal logic as the study of ampliative inferences, in contrast to the deductive inferences studied by formal logic. But it is also common to link their difference to the distinction between formal and informal fallacies.Logic is based on various fundamental concepts. It studies arguments, which are made up of a set of premises together with a conclusion. Premises and conclusions are usually understood either as sentences or as propositions and are characterized by their internal structure. Complex propositions are made up of other propositions linked to each other by propositional connectives. Simple propositions have subpropositional parts, like singular terms and predicates. In either case, the truth of a proposition usually depends on the denotations of its constituents. Logically true propositions constitute a special case since their truth depends only on the logical vocabulary used in them. The arguments or inferences made up of these propositions can be either correct or incorrect. An argument is correct if its premises support its conclusion. The strongest form of support is found in deductive arguments: it is impossible for their premises to be true and their conclusion to be false. This is the case if they follow a rule of inference, which ensures the truth of the conclusion if the premises are true. A consequence of this is that deductive arguments cannot arrive at any substantive new information not already found in their premises. They contrast in this respect with ampliative arguments, which may provide genuinely new information. This comes with an important drawback: it is possible for all their premises to be true while their conclusion is still false. Many arguments found in everyday discourse and the sciences are ampliative arguments. They are sometimes divided into inductive and abductive arguments. Inductive arguments usually take the form of statistical generalizations while abductive arguments are inferences to the best explanation. Arguments that fall short of the standards of correct reasoning are called fallacies. For formal fallacies, the source of the error is found in the form of the argument while informal fallacies usually contain errors on the level of the content or the context. Besides the definitory rules of logic, which determine whether an argument is correct or not, there are also strategic rules, which describe how a chain of correct arguments can be used to arrive at one's intended conclusion. In formal logic, formal systems are often used to give a precise definition of correct reasoning using a formal language.Systems of logic are theoretical frameworks for assessing the correctness of reasoning and arguments. Aristotelian logic focuses on reasoning in the form of syllogisms. Its traditional dominance was replaced by classical logic in the modern era. Classical logic is \"classical\" in the sense that it is based on various fundamental logical intuitions shared by most logicians. It consists of propositional logic and first-order logic. Propositional logic ignores the internal structure of simple propositions and only considers the logical relations on the level of propositions. First-order logic, on the other hand, articulates this internal structure using various linguistic devices, such as predicates and quantifiers. Extended logics accept the basic intuitions behind classical logic and extend it to other fields, such as metaphysics, ethics, and epistemology. This happens usually by introducing new logical symbols, such as modal operators. Deviant logics, on the other hand, reject certain classical intuitions and provide alternative accounts of the fundamental laws of logic. While most systems of logic belong to formal logic, some systems of informal logic have also been proposed. One prominent approach understands reasoning as a dialogical game of persuasion while another focuses on the epistemic role of arguments. Logic is studied in and applied to various fields, such as philosophy, mathematics, computer science, and linguistics. Logic has been studied since Antiquity, early approaches including Aristotelian logic, Stoic logic, Anviksiki, and the mohists. Modern formal logic has its roots in the work of late 19th-century mathematicians such as Gottlob Frege.\n\n> - via [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic)\n","n":0.036}}},{"i":929,"$":{"0":{"v":"locate","n":1},"1":{"v":"\n- Areas: [[devlog.linux]]\n\n---\n\n- Not installed by default on Ubuntu as it is on CentOS\n- `mlocate` is the newer implementation of `locate`\n- On latest Linux distros, when you run `locate` it actually runs `mlocate`\n- The `locate` utility works better and faster than the `find` command (locate's counterpart) because instead of searching the file system when a file search is initiated, it would look through a database.

Within your personal network localhost has a separate IP address like 192.168.0.1. (for most cases) which is different from the one you use on the internet.

A load balancer acts as the “traffic cop” sitting in front of your servers and routing client requests across all servers capable of fulfilling those requests in a manner that maximizes speed and capacity utilization and ensures that no one server is overworked, which could degrade performance.\n\nIf a single server goes down, the load balancer redirects traffic to the remaining online servers. When a new server is added to the server group, the load balancer automatically starts to send requests to it.\n\n## Types of Load Balancers – Based on Functions\n\nSeveral load balancing techniques are there for addressing the specific network issues:\n\n**Network Load Balancer / Layer 4 (L4) Load Balancer:**\n\nBased on the network variables like [[devlog.IP address]] and destination ports, Network Load balancing is the distribution of traffic at the transport level through the routing decisions. Such load balancing is TCP i.e. level 4, and does not consider any parameter at the application level like the type of content, cookie data, headers, locations, application behavior etc. Performing network addressing translations without inspecting the content of discrete packets, Network Load Balancing cares only about the network layer information and directs the traffic on this basis only.\n\n**Application Load Balancer / Layer 7 (L7) Load Balancer:**\n\nRanking highest in the [[devlog.OSI model]], Layer 7 load balancer distributes the requests based on multiple parameters at the application level. A much wider range of data is evaluated by the L7 load balancer including the HTTP headers and SSL sessions and distributes the server load based on the decision arising from a combination of several variables. This way application load balancers control the server traffic based on the individual usage and behavior.\n\n**Global Server Load Balancer/Multi-site Load Balancer:**\n\nWith the increasing number of applications being hosted in cloud data centers, located at varied geographies, the GSLB extends the capabilities of general L4 and L7 across various data centers facilitating the efficient global load distribution, without degrading the experience for end users. In addition to the efficient traffic balancing, multi-site load balancers also help in quick recovery and seamless business operations, in case of server disaster or disaster at any data center, as other data centers at any part of the world can be used for business continuity.\n\n## Types of Load Balancers – Based on Configurations\n\nLoad Balancers are also classified as:\n\n**Hardware Load Balancers:**\n\nAs the name suggests, this is a physical, on-premise, hardware equipment to distribute the traffic on various servers. Though they are capable of handling a huge volume of traffic but are limited in terms of flexibility, and are also fairly high in prices.\n\n**Software Load Balancers:**\n\nThey are the computer applications that need to be installed in the system and function similarly to the hardware load balancers. They are of two kinds- Commercial and Open Source and are a cost-effective alternative to the hardware counterparts.\n\n**Virtual Load Balancers:**\n\nThis load balancer is different from both the software and hardware load balancers as it is the combination of the program of a hardware load balancer working on a virtual machine.\n\nThrough virtualization, this kind of load balancer imitates the software driven infrastructure. The program application of hardware equipment is executed on a virtual machine to get the traffic redirected accordingly. But such load balancers have similar challenges as of the physical on-premise balancers viz. lack of central management, lesser scalability and much limited automation.\n\n## Load Balancing Methods\n\nAll kinds of Load Balancers receive the balancing requests, which are processed in accordance with a pre-configured algorithm.\n\n**Industry Standard Algorithms**\n\nThe most common load balancing methodologies include:\n\n- Round Robin Algorithm:\n  It relies on a rotation system to sort the traffic when working with servers of equal value. The request is transferred to the first available server and then that server is placed at the bottom of the line.\n\n- Weighted Round Robin Algorithm:\n  This algorithm is deployed to balance loads of different servers with different characteristics.\n\n- Least Connections Algorithm:\n  In this algorithm, traffic is directed to the server having the least traffic.

It is a container orchestration tool. Developed by Google.\n\nTo understand what Kubernetes is good for, let's look at some examples:\n\n- You would like to run a certain application in a container on multiple different locations. Sure, if it's 2-3 servers/locations, you can do it by yourself but it can be challenging to scale it up to additional multiple location.\n- Performing updates and changes across hundreds of containers\n- Handle cases where the current load requires to scale up (or down)\n- If you are big team of engineers (e.g. 200) deploying applications using containers and you need to manage scaling, rolling out updates, etc. You probably want to use Kubernetes\n- The rise of [[devlog.microservices]] caused increased usage of container technologies.\n- Application nowadays comprise of multiple; hundreds to thousands of containers. Managing them using custom scripts can be a pain.\n- Container orchestration offers:\n  - High availability or no downtime.\n  - Scalability or high performance.\n  - Disaster recovery - backup, restore, etc.\n\n## What Kubernetes objects/components are there?\n\n- Pod(s)\n- Service\n- ReplicationController\n- ReplicaSet\n- DaemonSet\n- Namespace\n- ConfigMap\n\ncan use kubectl to deploy applications, inspect and manage cluster resources, and view logs.\n\n### Pods\n\n> A pod is a collection of containers sharing a network, acting as the basic unit of deployment in [[devlog.Kubernetes]]. All containers in a pod are scheduled on the same node.\n\nAn abstraction over a container - a pod creates a layer on top of a container. Usually, only one application is running per pod. You don't directly create pods. You create deployments.\n\nKubernetes offers a virtual network out of the box. Each pod gets its own IP Address. Which they can use to communicate with each other. It is an internal [[devlog.IP Address]].\n\nThey're ephemeral, meaning they are not persistent, they can die if the application crashes or if you run out of resources. A new one will automatically be created with new IP Address. To help with this, Kubernetes Service is used.\n\n### Service and Ingress\n\n- Static IP Address that can be attached to each pod. Life cycle of a service and a pod are not connected. Even if the pod dies, the service will still be there.\n- To make the application accessible through a browser, an external service needs to be created that opens communication from external sources. For a database, you'd have an internal service.\n- It also acts as a load balancer. It will catch a request and forward it to the node that is least busy.\n- **Ingress** is another component of Kubernetes that forwards request to the service. It makes URL more suitable for the end user.\n\n### ConfigMap and Secret\n\n- **ConfigMap** acts as an external configuration file. It is a way to store configuration data that is not in the code. Like a database URL that a pod utilizes.\n- To store username and password, **Secret** is used. It is not stored in plain text, it is base64 encoded. (This does not mean encryption)\n\n### Volumes\n\n- Volumes are used to persistently store data(logs, databases, etc.).\n- It basically attaches a physical storage - a hard drive or a network drive(local or remote) - to a pod.\n- K8s explicitly doesn't manage persistent data.\n\n### Deployment and StatefulSet\n\n- To reduce down time - to make it fault tolerance - you can replicate everything(a node). That is connected to the same service.\n- This replication of the pod isn't done manually. Instead you'd define a blueprint and tell it how many replicas you want it to run. This is called **Deployment**.\n- It is a abstraction over pods.\n- Deployment is used to create StateLess applications.\n- In practice, you'd be working with deployments not with pods.\n- You cannot replicate databases with Deployment, since databases have states and it can be prone to inconsistencies if deployments are used to replicate them.\n- **StatefulSet** are used to replicate databases or to create stateful applications. It also take care of scaling them up or down. It makes sure database reads and writes are synchronized.\n- Deploying StatefulSet applications can be tedious on K8s. It is a common practice to host database applications outside K8s and only have StateLess applications inside K8s cluster.\n\n## Kubernetes Architecture\n\n### Worker Machines/Nodes\n\n- Each node has multiple pods running on it.\n- There are 3 process that must be installed on each node that used to schedule and manage the pods.\n- Nodes are the cluster service that actually do that work.\n\n1. Container runtime\n   - [[devlog.Docker]]\n   - [[devlog.cri-o]]\n   - [[devlog.conatinerd]] (Most popular)\n2. Kubelet - is the process that actually schedules the pods and the containers underneath. It is the process of Kubernetes that has interfaces with both container runtime and the node(machine) itself. It assigns the resources etc.\n3. Kube Proxy - is the process that forwards the traffic from services to the pods. It has intelligent forwarding logic inside that makes sure the communication works in a performant way with low network overhead.\n\n### Master Node\n\nAll the managing processes are taken care by the Master node inside the K8s cluster. There are 4 processes that are installed on the master node. Completely different process from Worker Nodes that control the cluster state and the Worker Nodes.\n\n1. API Server - if you want to deploy a new application on a K8s cluster, you will interact with this using a client such as Kubernetes dashboard, a CLI tool like Kubelet. It is like a cluster gateway. It receives the initial request(changes) needed to made on the cluster or queries from the cluster and also takes care of authorization.\n2. Scheduler - intelligently decides which Worker Node the next component will run on. It estimates the resources required for your request and schedules a new pod is to be scheduled.\n3. Controller manager - when pods die on a node, it detects state changes and tries to recover the cluster state. It makes the request to the scheduler to restore those dead pods. Scheduler does its thing.\n4. etcd - Key value store that stores the cluster state. It is the brain of the cluster. Every change inside the cluster is saved in this key value store. etcd is how the scheduler gets its info from. The actual application's data is NOT stored on etcd.\n\nA K8s cluster is made up of multiple master nodes. Each master node runs its own processes. API Server is load balanced and etcd store does a distributed storage across all master nodes. They don't take a lot of resources compared to the worker nodes as their job is just delegating work.\n\n## Minikube\n\nMinikube is a tool that lets you run Kubernetes locally. Minikube runs a single-node Kubernetes cluster on your personal computer so that you can try out Kubernetes, or for daily development work.\n\nIt is a one node cluster, master and worker process run on one node. It comes with docker preinstalled. It runs via VM or a hypervisor.\n\n## kubectl\n\nKubectl is the Kubernetes command line tool that allows you to run commands against Kubernetes clusters. For example, you can use it to create, delete, list, and inspect Kubernetes objects. It is basically a client for the Kubernetes API Server.\n\n- Get all components\n\n`kubectl get all`\n`kubectl get all | grep`\n\n- Get status of nodes\n\n`kubectl get nodes`\n\n- Get status of pods\n\n`kubectl get pods`\n\n- Get status of services\n\n`kubectl get services`\n\n- Create components\n\n`kubectl create`\n\n- Create deployment\n\n`kubectl create deployment nginx-depl --image=nginx` (most basic blueprint, rest are defaults)\n\n- Get deployments\n\n`kubectl get deployment`\n\n- Replicaset - managing replicas of a pod\n\n`kubectl get replicaset`\n\n- Edit deployment\n\n`kubectl edit deployment nginx-depl` (will get auto-generated config file with default values)\n\n### Debugging pods\n\n`kubectl logs pod-name`\n\n- Get additional information about a pod\n\n`kubectl describe pod pod-name`\n\n- Get the terminal of the application(pod)\n\n`kubectl exec -it pod-name -- bin/bash`\n\n- Delete deployment\n\n`kubectl delete deployment deployment-name`\n\n### Kubernetes deployment configuration file\n\nIf a deployment does not exist, it will be created. If it exists, it will be updated.\n\n`kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml`\n`kubectl apply -f config-file-nginx.yaml`\n\nIt is used for creating and configuring K8s clusters. There are 3 parts to it:\n\n1. Metadata\n2. Specification\n   - Attributes are specific to the `kind`\n3. Status (auto-generated and added by kubernetes)\n   - Kubernetes will compare the desired with the actual state and if the desired state ≠ actual state, K8 will try to fix it.\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/zubayr/image/upload/v1655117494/wiki/ipq3mbgswsrb0ufg7hrt.png)\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/zubayr/image/upload/v1655117667/wiki/fakkxkxbdvspydlfnd4f.png)\n\n- The status is constantly updated, it gets it’s data from `etcd`.\n- The format of the configuration file is [[devlog.YAML]].\n- The code is stored along with the source code of your application or it can have it's own repository.\n- The configuration file is structured in a \"template\" or a \"blueprint\" way.\n- The connection is made using \"selectors\" and \"labels\".\n- Pods get the label through the template blueprint.\n- This label is matched by the selector.\n- To get the configuration of a running deployment, use `kubectl get deployment deployment-name -o yaml`\n  - You'll find a lot of information will be auto-generated by Kubernetes.\n- To copy a deployment you already have, you'll have to remove auto-generated stuff and clean the configuration file before creating a deployment from it.\n- You can use the configuration file to delete a deployment. `kubectl delete -f deployment.yaml`\n\n### Creating a Secret\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/zubayr/image/upload/v1655127535/wiki/ag8cc3fib3l5qtkvwasf.png)\n\nWhen you store values, don’t use plain text, encode them in base64. For example: `echo -n \"somevalue\" | base64`\n\n`kubectl apply -f secrets.yaml`\n\nSecret once created can be referenced in your deployment configuration files.\n\nExample of secret being referenced:\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/zubayr/image/upload/v1655127895/wiki/lmddjxbristzwqipuuy3.png)\n\n### Creating a Service\n\nDeployment and Service can be put in a single file. You don’t define a type unlike an External Service where type is defined because Internal Service or ClusterIP(it gives an internal IP Address) is the default.\n\nExample of a Service configuration\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/zubayr/image/upload/v1655128136/wiki/vepvw9yubv8izozijvjo.png)\n\nReapply the `deployment.yaml` and the newly added Service will also be created.\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/zubayr/image/upload/v1655128207/wiki/ljbcr1cfavkzz0lsbjd1.png)\n\nTo validate if the Service is attached to the correct Pod, you can run `kubectl describe service service-name` and cross check `endpoints` IP Address with the Pod’s `kubectl get pod -o wide`.\n\n### Creating ConfigMap\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/zubayr/image/upload/v1655128682/wiki/mow4k1vejxaungybxje8.png)\n\nConfigMap must already be created in the K8s cluster before referencing it.\n\n`kubectl apply -f configmap.yaml`\n\nReferencing ConfigMap\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/zubayr/image/upload/v1655128847/wiki/odygjn3izkrd8gotfhlq.png)\n\n### Creating an External Service\n\nIt is very similar to a typical Service. Internal service also acts like a load balancer but an External Service acts like loan balancer by accepting external request by assigning the service an external [[devlog.IP Address]].\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/zubayr/image/upload/v1655129162/wiki/gpts0wcs1wrdij7txbfc.png)\n\n## Namespaces\n\nNamespaces are a way to organize clusters into virtual sub-clusters — they can be helpful when different teams or projects share a Kubernetes cluster. Any number of namespaces are supported within a cluster, each logically separated from others but with the ability to communicate with each other. Namespaces cannot be nested within each other.\n\nAny resource that exists within Kubernetes exists either in the default namespace or a namespace that is created by the cluster operator. Only nodes and persistent storage volumes exist outside of the namespace; these low-level resources are always visible to every namespace in the cluster.\n\nWhen you create a cluster by default K8s gives you 4 namespaces out of the box.\n\nTo list namepsaces - `kubectl get namepsace`\n\nThe Kubernetes-dashboard namespace is shipped automatically in minikube(it is specific to minikube installation).\n\n1. `kube-system`\n\nIt is not meant for your use, you shouldn't modify it. The components that are deployed on `kube-system` are system processes. They're from master and managing processes or kubectl.\n\n2. `kube-public`\n\nIt has publicly accessible data. A configmap which contains cluster information(accessible even without authentication).\n\nRun `kubectl cluster-info` to get this information.\n\n3. `kube-node-lease`\n\nIt holds information about the heartbeats of nodes. Each node has associated lease object in namespace which contains information about that node's availability.\n\n4 `default`\n\nThis is the namespace that is referenced by default for every Kubernetes command, and where every Kubernetes resource is located by default. Until new namespaces are created, the entire cluster resides in ‘default’.\n\n### Create your own namespace\n\nRun `kubectl create namespace <name-of-namespace>`\n\nOR\n\nUse namespace configuration file to create a namespace(recommended because you can integrate version control).\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/zubayr/image/upload/v1656236351/wiki/vahcacuyv9fjezvza8e4.png)\n\n### When yo use namespace\n\nTo avoid your default namespace to get filled with different components that you might use. It can get difficult to manage as you’d have no overview of your resources.\n\nResources can be ground using namespaces. A way of logically grouping your resources inside the cluster.\n\nFor example:\n\n- A namespace for your DBses and required resources.\n- A namespace for monitoring, where you can deploy [[devlog.Prometheus]] and all the stuff it needs.\n- A namespace for [[devlog.elastic stack]], where the [[devlog.ElasticSearch]], [[devlog.kibana]] resources go.\n- A namespace for ngnix-ingress resources.\n\nThey should be avoided if the project is not that large or doesn’t have that many users(as per official guide) but you can do it anyway instead of throwing everything in the default namespace.\n\n**Conflicts**\n\nNamespaces are also useful if you’ve multiple teams.\nTo avoid conflicts such as deploying of the same application in a single namespace and having it overwritten by the other teams. You can use namespaces for different projects inside your cluster.\n\n**Resource sharing**\n\nLets say you’ve one cluster and you want to host both staging and development environment in the same cluster(to utilize common resources without having to redeploy them for different environments).\n\n**Blue/Green deployment**\n\nYou can have two different versions of production application that share common resources.\n\n**Limit Access and Resources**\n\nYou can limit access and resources to namespaces when working with multiple teams. Minimizing the risk of one team accidentally interfering with the other. Each team will have their own secure, isolated environment.\n\nYou can limit the resources each namespace consumes. You can allot each team a share of resources for their applications.\n\n### Characteristics of Namespace\n\nYou can’t access most resources from another namespace.\n\n**Each NS must define it’s own configmap**. Eg: You’ll need to create a configmap for your namespace that is referencing a DB, you cannot use other namespace’s configmap. The same applies for secrets(credentials of a shared service).\n\nWhat you can access from another NS is a **service**.\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/zubayr/image/upload/v1656237672/wiki/ijk9q4etvplakbc2gfc0.png)\n\nWhere yellow is namespace and white is the service being referred in a configmap.\n\n**Components that cannot be namespaced**\n\nThese components live globally in a cluster, you cannot isolate them in a NS.\nEg: Persistent Volumes, Nodes.\n\nList resources that are not bound to namespace\n\n`kubectl api-resources --namespaced=false`\n\nList resources that are bound to namespace\n\n`kubectl api-resources --namespaced=true`\n\n### Create resource in a namespace\n\nRun `kubectl apply -f mysql-configmap.yaml --namespace=my-namespace`\n\nOR include the destination namespace in the configmap itself\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/zubayr/image/upload/v1656238019/wiki/jwpagppds4pc1qjvsa2p.png)\n\n### Get component created in a specific NS\n\n`kubectl get configmap -n my-namespace`\n\nBecause by default **it’ll only the default namespace** if you don’t specify.\n\n### Change active NS\n\nSwitch the default NS to your choice of NS\n\n`kubectl` doesn’t have an solution for this but `kubens` does!\n\nInstall `kubectx` which will install `kubens` as well.\n\n`kubens` ran without options will return all the NSes and highlights active NS.\n\n`kubens my-namespace` will switch the active NS to `my-namespace`\n\n## etcd\n\n## Taints\n\n## Sidecar containers\n\n- https://www.magalix.com/blog/the-sidecar-pattern\n\n## Resources\n\n- [Kube by Example Homepage](https://kubebyexample.com/)\n- [Concepts | Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/_print/)\n- [An Ultimate Kubernetes Hands-on Labs and Tutorials | kubelabs](https://collabnix.github.io/kubelabs/)\n","n":0.02}}},{"i":952,"$":{"0":{"v":"killall","n":1},"1":{"v":"\n- Areas: [[devlog.linux]]\n\n---\n\n`killall` is used for killing any or all running process on the system based on a given name.

After creating a cluster, you can use the usual kubectl CLI to manage resources.\n\nTo quote the documentation:\n\n> kops will not only help you create, destroy, upgrade and maintain production-grade, highly available, Kubernetes cluster, but it will also provision the necessary cloud infrastructure.\n\nKey features of Kops:\n\n- Kops simplifies Kubernetes cluster setup and management, especially in comparison to the amount of effort needed to manually set up master and worker nodes.\n- It automates the provisioning of Highly Available Kubernetes clusters.\n- The tool manages Route53, AutoScaling Groups, ELBs for many different tasks from master and node bootstrapping to the API server and rolling updates to your cluster.\n- It’s multi-architecture ready and supports ARM64.\n- It supports multiple cloud platforms, which makes it a better choice if you’re afraid of getting locked into a specific Kubernetes offering.\n- It’s an open-source tool, so you can use it for free. However, you still need to pay for and maintain the underlying infrastructure created by Kops to manage your cluster.\n\nVia - [AWS EKS vs. ECS vs. Fargate vs. Kops: Where to Manage Your Kubernetes in 2022? - CAST AI – Kubernetes Automation Platform](https://cast.ai/blog/aws-eks-vs-ecs-vs-fargate-where-to-manage-your-kubernetes/)\n\nKops does the job much faster. It’s a CLI tool you need to install on your local machine together with kubectl. To get a cluster running, use the Kops create cluster command. The great thing about Kops is that it manages most of the AWS resources you need for your Kubernetes cluster.\n\nContrary to EKS, Kops creates master nodes as EC2 instances – you can always access them directly to make modifications around the networking layer, size, etc. You can monitor these nodes directly too.\n\nKops lets you create a cluster really fast, but managing it is more complicated. There’s much groundwork to cover for upgrading and replacing master nodes for new Kubernetes versions. Creating a new cluster in a new VPC with Kops might be easier than that.\nWhen it comes to maintenance tasks like adding, replacing, and upgrading worker nodes, Kops performs quite similarly to [[devlog.AWS EKS]].

Install required plugin on Jenkins\n\n   - This approach can be limited to the input fields provided\n   - ![](https://res.cloudinary.com/zubayr/image/upload/v1654762016/wiki/yoxzochqrzziu0oxoisw.png)\n   - ![](https://res.cloudinary.com/zubayr/image/upload/v1654762087/wiki/war7fpncaxvvo0mooc8k.png)\n   - If a plugin is not available on “Global Tool Configuration” page it can be installed from “Manage Plugins” page\n   - ![](https://res.cloudinary.com/zubayr/image/upload/v1654762206/wiki/mjbfwr6itejojmx7hbs6.png)\n\n2. Install those tools directly on the server(where Jenkins is running)\n   - This approach is more flexible (scripting is easier)\n   - If your Jenkins is running as a [[devlog.docker]] container\n   - `docker exec -u 0 -it container-id bash`\n   - Install the tool inside the container based on the distro you’re using(`cat /etc/issue`)\n\n## Create a freestyle job\n\nNote: Freestyle jobs can be limiting because it can result in chaining freestyle jobs. The configuration is based on UI not scripting. It is not suitable for complex workflows. Plugins are limiting because of input field provided.\nUsing freestyle jobs for multiple tasks can create chaining of freestyle jobs and its bad. They're for one singular step. You'll need multiple plugins managing them can be tedious.\n\nSelect your type of job from “New Item” page\nNote: In prod, you’ll usually be dealing with a “Pipeline” job type\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/zubayr/image/upload/v1654762490/wiki/okcheuvfts7fmczc1lzf.png)\n\nConfigure your freestyle job\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/zubayr/image/upload/v1654762596/wiki/y8a6hducx3kizheoeqov.png)\n\nOn “Build” tab, write your shell commands to be executed.\nNote: You cannot use commands of plugins you’ve installed, only the programs you’ve installed directly on the server where Jenkins is running.\n**You can however “Invoke” the said plugin as a “Build step”**\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/zubayr/image/upload/v1654762838/wiki/t541ooixskhpr6xr6pbg.png)\n\nOn Jenkins main view, you’ll find your list of jobs.\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/zubayr/image/upload/v1654762908/wiki/tevepvm7fv4ewkdfhxfj.png)\n\nYou can also preview a build.\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/zubayr/image/upload/v1654762944/wiki/cpktacrn5nmocouewzza.png)\n\n## Configuring a [[devlog.Git]] repository\n\nUnder “Source Code Management” tab\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/zubayr/image/upload/v1654763672/wiki/wpg46yorlqlkp1isdzyc.png)\n\nUse “Jenkins Credentials Provider“ to add credentials\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/zubayr/image/upload/v1654763750/wiki/nsidkaihilnbheepedbp.png)\n\nWhenever you run a job, Jenkins will checkout the code locally for latest commits and then it’ll run the job(test, build) against it.\n\n## Docker in Jenkins\n\nMaking Docker available inside Jenkins\n\nAttaching a volume to Jenkins from the host. Currently our Jenkins is running on a server(where Docker commands are available), we can mount Docker runtime directory from the host into the container as a volume.\n\nStop and start Jenkins docker container with additional volumes.\n\n- `docker stop container-id`\n- Move the old Jenkins config to the new container using the existing volume (`jenkins_home`)\n\n```\ndocker run -p 8080:8080 -p 50000:50000 -d \\\n-v jenkins_home:/var/jenkins_home \\\n-v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \\\n-v $(which docker):/usr/bin/docker jenkins/jenkins:lts\n```\n\n- `docker exec -it container-id bash`\n- Run `docker` to check if it’s available\n- However, you’ll not be allowed to pull any images, because the Jenkins service user doesn’t have permissions for the docker file(which was mounted from host)\n  - `ls -l /var/run/docker.sock`\n  - Add permissions for the Jenkins user by logging in as root user on the container\n  - `docker exec -u 0 -it container-id bash`\n  - `chmod 666 /var/run/docker.sock`\n  - Once done, you’ll be able to use docker commands inside the the Jenkins container while as the Jenkins service user.\n\nAs part of our freestyle job, you can add shell commands to make an image out of the generated `.jar` and you can also push it to a docker repository(DockerHub).\n\nFor pushing the image to the DockerHub repository, you will need to add credentials to Jenkins.\n\nAnd to use the credentials(insecure):\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/zubayr/image/upload/v1654765785/wiki/wcul2oihla4vtmu0mido.png)\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/zubayr/image/upload/v1654765883/wiki/zwd5847ew0gf4mhffq5v.png)\n\nTag the image using the repository name.\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/zubayr/image/upload/v1654765934/wiki/oklywlv24wee6ytbcbvv.png)\n\nIf you were using a private repository other than DockerHub, you’d have to specify repository host name as an additional parameter for the `docker login` command\n\nA more secure way of passing the password is using standard input\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/zubayr/image/upload/v1654766232/wiki/ktmvbbujpr4c8hj0h9on.png)\n\n## Push Docker image to [[devlog.nexus]] repository\n\n- Before you can do this, you’ll need to register the Nexus repository’s IP and port explicitly by running `vim /etc/docker/daemon.conf` on the Nexus host.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"insecure-registries\": [\"nexus-docker-repo-ip-address:port\"]\n}\n```\n\n- Restart docker `systemctl restart docker\n- Start Jenkins container\n- Add the permissions for the Jenkins user to use docker commands(scroll up to “Docker in Jenkins”)\n- Create credentials for Nexus Docker repository\n- Putting it all together will look something like\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/zubayr/image/upload/v1654768504/wiki/yxpknd7sgvmkbysemwjj.png)\n\nNotice the Nexus [[devlog.ip address]] and port substituted for repository location/name and for `docker login` the host is mentioned.\n\n## Pipeline jobs\n\n- Pipeline jobs are more suited for [[CI/CD|devlog.CI⁄CD pipeline]], you can do scripting - pipeline as code.\n- To write a new script, go to the “Pipeline” tab after selecting “New item” → “Pipeline job”\n- - A pipeline job is recommended when you want to execute 2 tasks in parallel, or when you need user input if you want to programmatically use conditional statements in your pipeline script or even setting variables.\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/zubayr/image/upload/v1654774358/wiki/jvj6p0ekwiv96sauhtte.png)\n\n- Scripting is done in [[devlog.groovy]]\n- Groovy sandbox means you can execute a limited no. of Groovy functions, for which you don’t need approval from a Jenkins admin.\n- Inline pipleline scripts are fine for small pipelines but best practice is having the pipeline script in a git repository.\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/zubayr/image/upload/v1654775265/wiki/fg0pusq07odw4l2etqbw.png)\n\n- The script should be written inside “Jenkinsfile” as the standard.\n\n## Pipeline Syntax\n\n- Scripted\n  - First syntax, allows usage of Groovy.\n  - Advanced scripting capabilities, high flexibility.\n  - Difficult to start.\n- Declarative\n  - Was added recently, make it easier to get started\n  - Predefined structure\n- Required fields (for declarative )\n  - “pipeline” must be top level\n  - “agent” where to execute(relevant for Jenkins cluster)\n  - “stages” where the “work” happens\n  - You can have multiple stages within which you will have “steps” which is where the actual commands go.\n- Required field (for scripted)\n  - You simply need “node”\n\nAn example script after running will look something like\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/zubayr/image/upload/v1654776281/wiki/nawyrptgirflydj5n0ij.png)\n\n## Jenkinsfile Syntax\n\n`#!/usr/bin/env groovy` is at the top of the file to let your editor know that you're working with a Groovy script.\nWhenever there is a variable inside a string, it has to use double quotes `\"\"`.\n\n### `post` attribute\n\nExecutes some logic after all the stages have been executed. It can have conditions with keywords like, `always` that will run regardless of the outcome of the stages. `success` will only run if all the stages have succeeded. `failure` will only run if any of the stages have failed. It basically defines build status or build state changes.\n\n```groovy\npost {\n  always {\n    echo \"This will always run\"\n  }\n  success {\n    echo \"This will only run if all the stages have succeeded\"\n  }\n  failure {\n    echo \"This will only run if any of the stages have failed\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIn Jenkinsfile, you can define conditionals for each stage.\n\n```groovy\npipeline {\n  agent any\n  stages {\n    stage('Stage 1') {\n      when {\n        expression {\n          BRANCH_NAME == \"dev\" || BRANCH_NAME == \"master\"\n        }\n      }\n      steps {\n        echo \"Will only run if branch is dev or master\"\n      }\n    }\n    stage('Stage 2') {\n      steps {\n        echo \"Stage 2\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Environmental variables\n\nYou can use environmental variables in your Jenkinsfile which Jenkins has provided out of the box such as `BRANCH_NAME`. To find the list of available environmental variables, you can see `/env-vars.html`.\n\nYou can define your own environmental variables in Jenkinsfile. They will be available for all the stages.\n\n```groovy\npipeline {\n  agent any\n  environment {\n    NEW_VERSION = \"1.0.0\"\n  }\n\n  stages {\n    stage('Build') {\n      steps {\n        echo \"Building new version: ${NEW_VERSION}\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nUsing credentials in Jenkinsfile. You will first have to define them in Jenkins GUI and then bind them to the env variable. For which you'll need \"Credentials Binding\" plugin.\n\n```groovy\npipeline {\n  agent any\n  environment {\n    SERVER_CREDENTIALS = credentials('server-credentials')\n  }\n\n  stages {\n    stage('Deploy') {\n      steps {\n        sh \"${SERVER_CREDENTIALS}\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n\n  stages {\n    stage('Deploy') {\n      steps {\n        echo \"deploying the application\"\n        withCredentials([\n          usernamePassword(credentials: 'server-credentials', usernameVariable: USER, passwordVariable: PWD)\n        ]) {\n          sh \"echo ${USER} ${PWD}\"\n        }\n        }\n      }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIf you need the credentials only for one stage you can use a wrapper and define it inside the stage.\n\n### `tools` attribute\n\nBasically provides you build tools for your pipeline to build you project. It has to be preconfigured in Jenkins.\n\n```groovy\npipeline {\n  agent any\n  tools {\n    maven 'Maven'\n  }\n\n  stages {\n    stage('Build') {\n      steps {\n        echo \"Building...\"\n        sh 'mvn install'\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### `parameters` attribute\n\nTo parameterize your build.\n\nType of parameters:\n\n- string (name, defaultvalue, description)\n- choice (name, choice, description)\n- booleanParam (name, defaultvalue, description)\n\n```groovy\npipeline {\n  agent any\n  parameters {\n   // string(name: 'VERSION', defaultValue: '', description: 'Version to be deployed on production')\n    choices(name: 'VERSION', choice: ['1.1.0', '1.2.0'], description: 'Version to be deployed on production')\n    booleanParam(name: 'executeTests', defaultValue: true, description: '')\n  }\n\n  stages {\n    stage('test') {\n      when {\n        expression{\n          params.executeTests\n        }\n      }\n      steps {\n        echo \"testing...\"\n      }\n    }\n\n    stage('Deploy') {\n      steps {\n          echo \"Deploying application....\"\n          echo \"Version number: ${params.VERSION}\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nNext time you run the job, it'll pull the latest changes from the Jenkinsfile and you'll be able to \"Build with Parameters\".\n\nYou can use external scripts inside your groovy script. You can also write groovy code inside `script` attribute in your `steps`.\n\n```groovy\n// groovy script\ndef build() {\n  echo \"building application\"\n}\n\ndef test() {\n  echo \"testing application\"\n}\n\ndef deploy() {\n  echo \"deploying application\"\n}\n\nreturn this\n```\n\n```groovy\ndef gv\n// making gv global\npipeline {\n  agent any\n  stages {\n    stage('init') {\n      steps {\n        script {\n          gv = load \"external-script.groovy\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n\n  stage ('build') {\n    steps {\n      script {\n        gv.build()\n      }\n    }\n  }\n\n  stage ('test') {\n    steps {\n      script {\n        gv.test()\n      }\n    }\n  }\n\n  stage ('deploy') {\n    steps {\n      script {\n        gv.deploy()\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAll environment variables from Jenkinsfile are available in the groovy script.\n\n### Input Parameters in Jenkinsfile\n\nUser can input values for the parameters while running the job.\n\n```groovy\npipeline {\n  agent any\n  stages{\n    stage('Deploy') {\n      input {\n        message: \"Select the environment to deploy to\"\n        ok \"Done\"\n        parameters {\n            choices(name: 'ENV', choice: ['dev', 'staging', 'production'], description: 'Version to be deployed on production')\n            // this is a scoped parameter, it is not global\n            // you can also use script block but the syntax for input differs\n        }\n      }\n      steps {\n        echo \"Deploying application....\"\n        echo \"Deploying to ${ENV}\"\n        script {\n          env.ENV = input message: \"Select environment to deploy to\", ok: \"Done\", parameters: [choices(name: 'ENV', choice: ['dev', 'staging', 'production'], description: 'Version to be deployed on production')]\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Multibranch Pipeline\n\nSingle branch pipeline would look something like:\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/zubayr/image/upload/v1654854298/wiki/nsj9vutzvbdblniztxus.png)\n\nTypically, you’ll run tests on all the branches but you’d execute deployment only on Master branch. Other branches are merged into the Master branch and then the build, deploy jobs are triggered.\n\nWhy do you need pipelines for all the branches? So that we can run tests to see everything is working properly on non-Master branches before merge.\nWe also need different behaviour based on branch. For example: “If branch is master, run test, build and deploy” and “if branch isn’t master, run test and build skip deploy” etc.\n\nPipelines need to be created dynamically in a Multibranch Pipeline.\n\nSelect “Multibranch Pipeline” from the “New Item” page\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/zubayr/image/upload/v1654854883/wiki/qbxeuoaytkq6wprkwais.png)\n\nHere, we can use regular expression to filter what branches to include. In this jobs, we’re choosing all the branches on the given repository. The rest of the build configuration will be made in the Jenkinsfile.\n\n## Jenkins credentials\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/zubayr/image/upload/v1654858019/wiki/s6tnlznggh5akynpvajl.png)\n\nThe credentials feature is thanks to a plugin. There are different credentials plugins that add more options(kinds of credentials).\n\nThere are three scopes for credentials, System and Global credentials can be added on “Manage Credentials” view and Project specific credentials can be added from inside the job. System wide credentials will not be accessible inside the project.\n\n## Jenkins Shared Library\n\nLets say we're working with a lot of micro services that contribute to one whole application. In Jenkins we'd use multi branch pipelines for each of that microservice. We'd build each of the microservice as a separate application; meaning you'd have multiple projects with multiple Jenkinsfiles for building those pipelines. Most of the logic in the Jenkinsfile would be same for all the applications in this case. Building `.jar`, building Docker images, pushing to Nexus repository...all these steps will be same for all the applications. To keep this aligned with DRY and to make this process efficient we use **Jenkins Shared Library**.\n\n- It is an extension to Pipelines.\n- It is it's own repository written in Groovy(just like Jenkinsfile).\n- We can write all the logic that is going to be shared across many different applications in a Shared Library and reference that logic in the Jenkinsfile in each project. (Basically, function calls in the Jenkinsfile).\n\n- It can also be used with different projects(with different teams).\n- If not all the steps are same in the Jenkinsfile across those different projects, whatever logic is common among those projects can be referenced from Shared Library instead of repeating the logic across multiple Jenkinsfile. E.g.\n  - Company wide Nexus repository.\n  - Company wide slack channel.\n\n### Create a Shared Library\n\n1. Init a git repository.\n2. Create a Groovy project in Maven and write the functions.\n3. Make the Shared Library available throughout Jenkins/or specific pipeline.\n4. Use the Shared Library in Jenkinsfile to extend the Pipeline.\n\n### Structure of Shared Library\n\n- Create a Groovy project in Maven.\n- Main folder `vars` contains all the functions that we're going to call from a Jenkinsfile.\n- Each function/execution step will be in its own Groovy script(inside `vars`).\n- `src` folder contains helper logic(utility code etc).\n- `resources` folder is where you'll keep your non-Groovy code(SQL scripts, external libraries, Powershell scripts, JSON files etc).\n\n```groovy\n#!/usr/bin/env groovy\n\n// vars/buildJar.groovy; functions(execution steps) are referenced by their filename\n\ndef call(){\n  // here is where the logic goes\n  echo \"Building the application\"\n  sh \"mvn package\"\n}\n\n```\n\n- Commit and push the code the git repository.\n- Make shared library available globally.\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/zubayr/image/upload/v1658158197/wiki/h0ffz078kfggwfsddytc.png)\n\nDefault version can either be a branch name, a commit hash or a tag. Having a fixed version is a good idea(to avoid breaking changes stopping a pipeline).\n\n- To use Shared Library in your Jenkinsfile:\n  - You'll need to import the Library in your Jenkinsfile.\n  - `@Library(\"jenkins-shared-library\")_` you'll need to add an underscore at the end of the `@Library` call if you don't have any variable/function definitions/calls and have `pipeline{}` directly after.\n\n```groovy\n#!/usr/bin/env groovy\n@Library(\"jenkins-shared-library\") // defined in Global Pipeline Libraries\n\ndef gv\n\npipeline{\n  agent any\n  tools{\n    maven 'Maven'\n  }\n  stages{\n    stage(\"init\")\n    ...\n    stage(\"build jar\"){\n      steps{\n        script{\n          buildJar()\n        }\n      }\n    }\n    stage(\"build images\"){\n      steps{\n        script{\n          buildImage()\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n- Commit/push the changes to remote repo of the Jenkinsfile.\n\n### Passing Parameters to Methods\n\n```groovy\n#!/usr/bin/env groovy\n\ndef call(String imageName){\n  sh \"docker build -t $imageName .\"\n  sh \"docker push $imageName\"\n}\n```\n\nWe can access global variables. We've all the environmental variables available in the Jenkinsfile also available in the Shared Library.\n\n**To extract logic into Groovy classes**:\n\nWe can add a function's logic to a standalone file inside the `src` folder inside a class in a `package`.\n\nHowever, unlike the Shared Library, we do NOT have access to the global/environmental variables when we use separate classes. To make pipeline syntax available we use `script` keyword as parameter to the class's function.\n\n```groovy\n// Docker.groovy\n#!/usr/bin/env groovy\n\npackage com.example\n\nclass Docker implements Serializable{\n  // `implements Serializable` to support saving the state of the execution if the pipeline is paused and then resumed.\n  def script\n\n  Docker(script){\n    this.script = script\n  }\n\n  def buildDockerImage(String imageName) {\n        script.echo \"building the docker image...\"\n        script.sh \"docker build -t $imageName .\"\n    }\n\n    def dockerLogin() {\n        script.withCredentials([script.usernamePassword(credentialsId: 'docker-hub-repo', passwordVariable: 'PASS', usernameVariable: 'USER')]) {\n            script.sh \"echo $script.PASS | docker login -u $script.USER --password-stdin\"\n        }\n    }\n\n    def dockerPush(String imageName) {\n        script.sh \"docker push $imageName\"\n    }\n\n}\n```\n\nTo call this function inside the `vars`'s groovy scripts\n\n**Note**: You can actually just call these class function directly to your Jenkinsfile instead of calling it in `vars` folder. But it is a best practice to call them in `vars` folder as an interface.\n\nThese are just making calls to different function in a single class.\n\n```groovy\n// buildImage.groovy\n#!/usr/bin/env groovy\n\nimport com.example.Docker\ndef call (String imageName){\n  // passing context from this function to the Docker class using `this` keyword\n  return new Docker(this).buildDockerImage(imageName)\n}\n```\n\n```groovy\n// dockerLogin.groovy\n#!/usr/bin/env groovy\n\nimport com.example.Docker\n\ndef call() {\n    return new Docker(this).dockerLogin()\n}\n```\n\n```groovy\n// dockerPush.groovy\n#!/usr/bin/env groovy\n\nimport com.example.Docker\n\ndef call(String imageName) {\n    return new Docker(this).dockerPush(imageName)\n}\n```\n\nYou will call these function in your `Jenkinsfile`\n\nAn alternative to having a Globally imported Shared Library, we can reference the library directly in the Jenkinsfile.\n\nInstead of using `@Library(jenkins-shared-library@master)...` use:\n\n```\nlibrary identifier: 'jenkins-shared-library@master', retriever: modernSCM(\n    [$class: 'GitSCMSource',\n    remote: 'https://gitlab.com/user/shared-library.git',\n    credentialsID: 'gitlab-credentials'\n    ]\n  )\n```\n\n## Webhooks\n\n## Code source\n\n- [nanuchi/jenkins-shared-library · GitLab](https://gitlab.com/nanuchi/jenkins-shared-library)\n","n":0.019}}},{"i":960,"$":{"0":{"v":"Javascript","n":1}}},{"i":961,"$":{"0":{"v":"Java","n":1},"1":{"v":"\n- Areas: [[areas.programming]]\n\n---\n\n- Java is a platform independent language.\n  - They brought a layer on top of operating systems known as the [[JVM]].\n  - Java was originally designed to write programs for things like refrigrator, cars etc.\n\n### To print a string out to the console\n\n`System.out.println(\"Hello world!\");`\n\n### Declaring integers\n\n`int variableName = value;`\n\n### Adding variables and printing them to the console\n\n    int x = 5;\n    int y = 6;\n    int sum = x + y;\n    System.out.printlt(sum);\n\n### String concatenation\n\n    System.out.println(\"sum = \" + sum)\n\n### `if` statement\n\n    if(y > x){\n        System.out.println(\"y is greater than x\")\n    }\n\n### `else` statement\n\n    if(y > x){\n        System.out.println(\"y is greater than x\");\n    }else if(y == x){\n        System.out.println(\"y is equal to x\");\n    }else{\n        System.out.println(\"y is less than x\");\n    }\n\n### Arithmetic operators\n\n- `+`- Addition\n- `-` - Subtraction\n- `*` - Multiplication\n- `/` - Division\n- `%` - Modulo Operation (Remainder after division\n- `++` - Increment\n- `--` - Decrement\n- `+=` - Addition Assignment\n- `-=` - Subtraction Assignment\n- `*=` - Multiplication Assignment\n- `/=` - Divison Assignment\n- `%=` - Modulus Assignment\n\n### Relational operators\n\n- `==` - Is Equal To\n- `=` - Assignment\n- `!=` - Not Equal To\n- `>` - Greater Than\n- `<` - Less Than\n- `>=` - Greater Than Or Equal To\n- `<=` - Less Than Or Equal To\n\n### Syntactic rules\n\n- Any complete statement will end in a semi colon (`;`)\n\n### `for` loop\n\n    // for(initial value; condition; increment/decrement), i++ is like writing i=i+1 or i += 1\n    for(int i = 0; i <= 10; i++){\n        System.out.println(\"i = \" + i);\n    }\n\n### `while` loop\n\n    int x = -10;\n\n    while(x <= 0){\n        System.out.println(\"x = \" + x);\n        x++;\n    }\n\n### `do` `while` loop\n\n    // most important difference from the while loop is that a do while loop will run at least once\n\n    int x = 10;\n\n    do{\n        System.out.println(\"x = \" + x);\n        x--;\n    }while(x > 0);\n\n### And `&&` Or `||`\n\n    int x, y;\n    x = 10;\n    y = -10;\n\n    if (x > 0 && y > 0){\n        System.out.println(\"Both integers are +ve\");\n    }else if (x > 0 || y > 0){\n        System.out.println(\"At least one integer is +ve\");\n    }else{\n        System.out.println(\"Both integers are -ve\")\n    }\n\n`&` \\<– verifies both operands,\n`&&` \\<– stops evaluating if the first operand evaluates to false since the result will be false, used in [[bitwise operations]]\n\n### `switch` `case` statement\n\n    int j = 2;\n\n    switch(j){\n        case 0:\n            System.out.println(\"Value is 0\");\n            break;\n        case 1:\n            System.out.println(\"Value is 1\")\n            break;\n        case 2:\n            System.out.println(\"Value is 2\")\n            break;\n        case 3:\n            System.out.println(\"Value is 3\")\n            break;\n        default:\n            System.out.println(\"No Value\")\n            break;\n\n    }\n\n- Wrapper classes such as Integer\n- Arrays, empty arrays\n- Two Dimensional Arrays, empty two dim arrays\n- Enhanced For loop\n- String\n  - Is not a primitive data type.

You can also omit the `show` command as it is the default.\n- If you want to display only [[devlog.IPv4]] or [[devlog.IPv6]] addresses:\n  - `ip -4 address` and `ip -6 address`\n- To get info about specific network inteface:\n  - `ip addr show dev enp0s3` or `ip a s dev enp0s3`\n- To get [[devlog.default gateway]]:\n  - `ip route show`\n- To turn an interface off/on:\n  - `ip link set enp0s3 down`\n  - The interface will be down(disabled) and to display it:\n    - `ip link dev enp0s3`\n  - `ip link set enp0s3 up` to enable it\n- To assign a new [[devlog.ip address]]:\n  - Remove existing IP Address from the interface: `ip address del 192.168.0.111/24 dev enp0s3`\n  - Add the needed IP Address: `ip address add 192.168.0.222/24 dev enp0s3`\n- To change default gateway;\n  - Removing existing default gateway: `ip route del default`\n  - Add a new default gateway: `ip route add default via 192.168.0.2`\n- To change the [[devlog.MAC]] Address:\n  - `ip link set dev enp0s3 address 08:00:27:51:05:01`\n","n":0.054}}},{"i":974,"$":{"0":{"v":"IP Address","n":0.707},"1":{"v":"\nRelated: [[devlog.subnet]]\n\n---\n\nIP Address is basically how computers(servers) talk to each other on the internet. IP Address is provided by a Network Interface of a computer, these are public IP Addresses. IP Address are made user friendly by using a [[devlog.dns]]that converts a domain name to an IP Address.\n\n**IP Address Components:**\n\nLike other network layer protocols, the IP addressing scheme is integral to the process of routing IP data through an internetwork.\n\nEach host on a TCP/IP network is assigned a unique 32-bit logical address. The IP address is divided into two main parts; the Network Number and the Host Number.\n\nThe network number identifies the network and must be assigned by the Internet Network Information Center (InterNIC) if the network is to be part of the Internet.\n\nThe host number identifies a host in the network and is assigned by the local network administrator.\n\n**IP Address Format:**\n\nThe 32-bit IP address is grouped 8 bits at a time, each group of 8 bits is an octet. Each of the four octets are separated by a dot, and represented in decimal format, this is known as dotted decimal notation. Each bit in an octet has a binary weight (128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1). The minimum value for an octet is 0 (all bits set to 0), and the maximum value for an octet is 255 (all bits set to 1).\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/zubayr/image/upload/v1655735910/wiki/wtzdd2lbx2pixujmqqx0.png)\n\n**IP Address Classes:**\n\nIP addressing supports three different commercial address classes; Class A, Class B, and Class C.\n\nIn a class A address, the first octet is the network portion, so the class A address of, 10.1.25.1, has a major network address of 10. Octets 2, 3, and 4 (the next 24 bits) are for the hosts. Class A addresses are used for networks that have more than 65,536 hosts (actually, up to 16,581,375 hosts!).\n\nIn a class B address, the first two octets are the network portion, so the class B address of, 172.16.122.204, has a major network address of 172.16. Octets 3 and 4 (the next 16 bits) are for the hosts. Class B addresses are used for networks that have between 256 and 65,536 hosts.\n\nIn a class C address, the first three octets are the network portion. The class C address of, 193.18.9.45, has a major network address of 193.18.9. Octet 4 (the last 8 bits) is for hosts. Class C addresses are used for networks with less than 254 hosts.\n\nVia — [Basic IP Addressing and Troubleshooting Guide](http://penta2.ufrgs.br/trouble/ts_ip.htm)\n\n---\n\n## Structure of an IP Address\n\nIP Addresses are written in decimal dotted notation.\n\n`192.168.0.1`\n\nEach part of the IP address is a binary octet.\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/zubayr/image/upload/v1656322930/wiki/gruxal4tsobjfhxdkw00.png)\n\nThis is important for [[devlog.subnet]]ting.\n\n## Networks and Hosts\n\nEvery IP address has a Network ID and a Host ID\n\nNetwork ID will remain same for every computer on this network.\n\nHost ID will be unique for every computer on this network.\n\nSubnet masks tells us which part is the Network ID and which is Host ID.\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/zubayr/image/upload/v1656323194/wiki/glrh3blvpzga1d4itquu.png)\n\nWhen we have `255` (all the 8 bits are 1) is where we essentially have a bit that is a `1`. It represents a Network ID.\n\nLast octet in the orange box is the Host ID, every bit in a subnet mask that is a `0` means there are values that can be assigned to host.\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/zubayr/image/upload/v1656323419/wiki/vsvc0stwao9rrbyuib2e.png)\n\nLets say you’ve a network with several computers, they each will have different host IDs but same network ID.\n\n## Classes of IPv4 Address\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/zubayr/image/upload/v1656323639/wiki/gnfsubay6bnavdg3spkv.png)\n\n**Private IP address range**\n\nReserved for private/internal use in an organization according to IETF RFC-1918.\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/zubayr/image/upload/v1656323694/wiki/piorhozhal6mgghcyo24.png)\n\n![[devlog.cidr]]\n\n---\n\n## How is an [[devlog.ip address]] assigned?\n\nApparently using some [[devlog.dhcp]] magic, [[devlog.router]] assigns an [[devlog.IP address]] to any computer/thing that connects to it.\n\nWhy is that most of the IP address start from `192.168.1.204` when they each of the octet can be anywhere between 0.255?\n\nIt is because of subnet mask. If your subnet mask is `255.255.255.0` it'll match one on one with `192.168.1.204` the first three of the IP address will always remain the same IN YOUR NETWORK.\n\nThe last octet or the number in subnet if it is 0 - it basically tells us that the last octet can be whatever you want (as long as it is between 0-255)\n\nThe first three octets are NETWORK ID - the last octet is HOST ID\n\nHOST ID will change based on the device connected.\n\nWhen a networks wants to talk to something that is not on the same network - it takes the help of Default Gateway aka Router.\n\nYou cannot use `192.168.1.0` it is the NETWORK ADDRESS.\n\nOR\n\nYou cannot use `192.168.1.255` it is the BROADCAST ADDRESS. When you send something to last IP Address in a network, it tells it to everyone in the network.\n\nOR\n\nYou cannot use `192.168.1.1` because it's the Router's address(Default Gateway)\n\nIn total you can `253` addresses.\n\n---\n\nYour IP Address is the size of 32 bits, 4 bytes(8 bits = 1 byte). Hence four binary octets.\n\nPowers of 2 chart is utilized to convert binary to decimal.\n\n8 Bit Octet Chart\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/zubayr/image/upload/v1656331702/wiki/npacf0svnom9sisa86sd.png)\n\n## Resources\n\n- [what is an IP Address? // You SUCK at Subnetting // EP 1 - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WfiTHiU4x8)\n","n":0.035}}},{"i":975,"$":{"0":{"v":"IoT","n":1},"1":{"v":"\nInternet of things can be anything, such as a refrigrator that is connected to the internet using a wireless connection, its part of the IoT, a NEST thermostat, a Smart TV, Smart Phones.\n\n- 802.11 or [[devlog.Wi-Fi]], wireless networks that can operate in infrastructure or ad hoc modes.\n- [[devlog.Bluetooth]], low-energy, which allows for a mesh network.\n- [[RFID]], uses electromagnetic fields to read data stored in embedded tags.\n- [[devlog.NFC]], enables two electronic devices to communicate within a 4-cm range.\n- [[IR]], operates wtih line of sight such as remote for a TV\n- [[Z-wave]], used primarily for home automation.

Partitioning is based on a column that is repeated in the dataset and involves grouping data by a particular value of the partition column. While bucketing organizes data by a range of values, mainly involving primary key or non-repeated values in a dataset.\n\nPartitioning is most effective for low volume data, as it carries the possibility of too many small partition creations and too many directories. And since bucketing results in equal volumes of data in each partition, joins at Map side will be quicker.\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zubayrrr/twiki/main/bin/image.8a2a68hilaj.png)\n\nA table can have both partitions and bucketing info in it; in that case, the files within each partition will have bucketed files in it. For example, if the above example is modified to include partitioning on a column, and that results in 100 partitioned folders, each partition would have the same exact number of bucket files – 20 in this case – resulting in a total of 2,000 files across all partitions.\n\n> via - <https://www.okera.com/blogs/using-apache-hive-bucketing-with-okera/>\n","n":0.046}}},{"i":1000,"$":{"0":{"v":"Hostname & Subdomains","n":0.577},"1":{"v":"\n- Areas: [[areas.networking]]\n\n---\n\nThe hostname is what a device is called on a network. Alternative terms for this are computer name and site name. The hostname is used to distinguish devices within a local network. In addition, computers can be found by others through the hostname, which enables data exchange within a network, for example. Hostnames are used on the internet as part of the fully qualified domain name.\n\nDifferentiation between hostname, domain and fully qualified domain name\n\nThe hostname is a freely selectable name for a host. For example, you could call a server in a company network responsible for the central administration of emails “mail” or “mail123”.\n\nHowever, if a computer needs to be available over the internet as well as locally, the hostname needs to be supplemented by information that indicates what part of the internet the computer is located in. In the internet, computers can be uniquely assigned using a combination of hostname and domain. These uniquely identifiable name chains are known as a “Fully Qualified Domain Name“ (FQDN). An example of an FQDN would be:\n\nmail123.example.com.\n\nIf you read the terms of the hierarchy from right to left, you can recognize the components of the FQDN in the following order: root label (empty), top level domain (.com), second level domain (example) and hostname (mail123).\n\nAn FQDN is a human-readable form of addressing. Unlike humans, computers work with numerical IP addresses to uniquely identify computers on the internet. Within the framework of a website visit, an intermediate step is necessary so that the alphanumeric domain can be translated into a numeric IP address.\n\nThe domain name system (DNS) is responsible for this name resolution. The entered domain is assigned to the corresponding IP address and then the searched-for page is called up. The purpose of this system is so that humans do not have to enter the IP address every time they visit a website, but can use a name that will be easier to remember instead.\n\nDo not confuse the hostname with a subdomain. This is also located to the left of the top-level domain, but does not designate a computer or server, just the domain area. The hostname is still far on the left. Example: In the FQDN www.example.ionos.com, “IONOS” denotes a domain name, “example” denotes a subdomain and www is the hostname.\n\n— via [What is a Hostname? Meaning, Example & how to check - IONOS](https://www.ionos.com/digitalguide/hosting/technical-matters/hostname/)\n\n## Hostname vs Subdomain\n\nBasically, \"domain\" and \"subdomain\" are the same entities, except that the \"sub\" prefix indicates a relationship between two domains. So you can basically talk of a \"subdomain\" only in relationship to another domain. For example `google.com` and `corp.google.com` both are domains, but `corp.google.com` is a subdomain of `google.com`. `google.com` itself is also a subdomain, a subdomain of top level domain (TLD) `com`.\n\nTLDs are the only domains that you can't talk of as \"subdomains\", because they don't have any higher-level domain above them.\n\nIt's similar to how a file system on a computer is organized: `/usr` and `/usr/bin` are both folders, but `/usr/bin` is a subfolder of `/usr`. `/usr` is a subfolder of the root folder (`/`). The root folder is the only folder that isn't a subfolder of anything.\n\nTechnically, any domain should have one or more **NS records** in the DNS, specifying the name server(s) serving that domain. It is possible to define a domain without it's own NS record, but this is considered trickery. One shouldn't set up DNS like that.\n\nHostname - as said in the other answer - is just an individual name assigned to a computer. If you combine hostname with domain, you get a Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN), that identifies a particular computer in the DNS. Any FQDN should translate to an **A record** in the DNS, specifying the IP address assigned to that FQDN (or AAAA record in case of IPv6 addresses).\n\nOne computer can have multiple hostnames and/or multiple FQDNs (even in different domains) which may be assigned either to the same IP address or to different IP addresses - this is fully flexible.\n\nFor example, `ns1.google.com` is a FQDN of one of the Google's name servers. `ns1` is a hostname here (we sometimes call it a **hostname part of the FQDN**), and `google.com` is a domain (similarly, a **domain part of the FQDN**).\n\nNote that the domain name itself may also be considered a FQDN, especially when the domain itself is also assigned an A record, as it is common nowadays (see below).\n\n`www` is just a specific hostname that is customarily used to identify the main web server for the given domain. So `www.google.com` is FQDN of Google's main web server. It is common nowadays to configure DNS so that the domain itself also has A record that refers to the same IP address that the `www` hostname, so typing for example `https://google.com` and `https://www.google.com` brings you to the same website.\n\nOf course hostnames/FQDNs are not used only for webservers; any computer in the network can have a hostname/FQDN. For example, Gmail's incoming and outgoing mail servers have FQDNS `imap.gmail.com` and `smtp.gmail.com`. You don't type these FQDNs into the web browser, because there's no web service on these machines; but you use them eg. when configuring your mail client to use Gmail.\n\n— via [Difference between Subdomain, hostname, host and www in a DNS system? - Super User](https://superuser.com/questions/1644463/difference-between-subdomain-hostname-host-and-www-in-a-dns-system)\n\n## Resources\n\n- [Why Do Some Websites Start With WWW1?

It resides on top of Hadoop to summarize Big Data, and makes querying and analyzing easy.\n  - Initially Hive was developed by Facebook, later the Apache Software Foundation took it up and developed it further as an open source under the name Apache Hive. It is used by different companies. For example, Amazon uses it in Amazon Elastic MapReduce.\n- It stores schema in a database and processed data into HDFS.\n- It is designed for OLAP.\n- Good for batch processing.\n- It provides SQL type language for querying called HiveQL or [[HQL]].\n- It is familiar, fast, scalable, and extensible.\n- Parallel computing(since it uses HDFS).\n- Supports partitions.\n- Supports bucketing.\n\n[[devlog.hadoop]] = [[devlog.hdfs]] + [[devlog.mapreduce]]\n\n[[devlog.hdfs]] - where your data gets distributed and [[devlog.mapreduce]] is where you write transformation jobs using java and MR will do distributed processing by reading the data from HDFS.\n\nIn MR you cannot write any SQL, you'll have to use Java for queries\n\nA SQL layer was introduced to communicate with MR\n\nHive is a query engine, it is not a DB. It doesn't have it's own storage to store data, Hive uses HDFS to store data.\n\nIt runs on Engine MR, often called as an Abstraction of MR.\nInternally it uses MR engine to process queries.\n\nHive replaces the Java part that was required to write SQL in MR.\n\nHive can also run on Spark Engine not just MapReduce(MR)\n\n---\n\nSend a request to Hive Server, create table test. hive stores metadata; all the table information. This metadata is different from what is stored on Master node.\n\nHive metadata is stored in an RDBMS(Oracle, MySQL etc) known as Remote meta store , the data is stored in HDFS.\n\nWhen you request hive to load or insert data, it'll get the metadata info about the table and based on that schema it'll store data on HDFS.\n\nWhen you request hive to select, hive will first query the metadata info and then get the data from HDFS and display's data in tables.\n\nThey decoupled the metadata from hive and use RDBMS for it.\n\nWhen there is no RDBMS provided for Hive, it in that case the metadata will be stored on an embedded RDBMS known as `Derby`, it comes along with Hive, doesn't have to be installed separately. Derby cannot be replaced. Embedded meta store, remote meta store.\n\nRemote meta store uses separate instance of RDBMS to store data, it is the most common in the real world. The embedded meta store will create problem when you have multiple machines(a cluster) running instances of Hive, multiple embedded meta store on nodes will create synchronization problems. You cannot make a distributed request. Hence a remote meta store is used.\n\nAll the nodes(that are running Hive) will refer to a node that is running an RDBMS. The configuration file(s, on each Hive node), derby will be removed automatically once you select RDBMS on the config file.\n\nEmbedded meta store is good for practicing on a single node,\n\na [[JDBC]] connection can also be made.\n\nHive can also be used with S3.\n\n### Limitations\n\n- It is not an OLTP system.\n- Not for real-time processing\n- Doesn't support full fledged [[devlog.sql]] queries (such as some joins, triggers)\n","n":0.043}}},{"i":1002,"$":{"0":{"v":"Hive Installation","n":0.707},"1":{"v":"\n### Installing [[devlog.hive]]\n\nTaken from:\n<https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1XdPbyAc9iWml0fPPNX91Yq3BRwkZAG2M>\n\n    Steps for hive installation\n    Download and Unzip Hive\n    Edit .bashrc file\n    Edit hive-config.sh file\n    Create Hive directories in HDFS\n    Initiate Derby database\n    Configure hive-site.xml file\n\n    download and unzip Hive\n    =============================\n    wget https://downloads.apache.org/hive/hive-3.1.2/apache-hive-3.1.2-bin.tar.gz\n    tar xzf apache-hive-3.1.2-bin.tar.gz\n\n    Edit .bashrc file\n    ========================\n    sudo nano .bashrc\n    export HIVE_HOME= /home/hdoop/apache-hive-3.1.2-bin\n\n    export PATH=$PATH:$HIVE_HOME/bin\n    source ~/.bashrc\n    Edit hive-config.sh file\n    ====================================\n    sudo nano $HIVE_HOME/bin/hive-config.sh\n    export HADOOP_HOME=/home/hdoop/hadoop-3.2.1\n    Create Hive directories in HDFS\n    ===================================\n    hdfs dfs -mkdir /tmp\n    hdfs dfs -chmod g+w /tmp\n    hdfs dfs -mkdir -p /user/hive/warehouse\n    hdfs dfs -chmod g+w /user/hive/warehouse\n\n    Fixing guava problem – Additional step\n    =================\n\n    rm $HIVE_HOME/lib/guava-19.0.jar\n    cp $HADOOP_HOME/share/hadoop/hdfs/lib/guava-27.0-jre.jar $HIVE_HOME/lib/\n\n    Initialize Derby and hive\n    ============================\n    schematool -initSchema -dbType derby\n\n\n    hive\n\n    optional Step – Edit hive-site.xml\n    ===========\n    cd $HIVE_HOME/conf\n    cp hive-default.xml.template hive-site.xml\n    sudo nano hive-site.xml – change metastore location to above created hdfs path(/user/hive/warehouse)\n","n":0.087}}},{"i":1003,"$":{"0":{"v":"Here Document","n":0.707},"1":{"v":"\n- Areas: [[devlog.linux]]\n\n---\n\nIn computing, a here document (here-document, here-text, heredoc, hereis, here-string or here-script) is a file literal or input stream literal: it is a section of a source code file that is treated as if it were a separate file.\n","n":0.156}}},{"i":1004,"$":{"0":{"v":"Helm","n":1},"1":{"v":"\nHelm is a Kubernetes deployment tool for automating creation, packaging, configuration, and deployment of applications and services to Kubernetes clusters.\n\n[[devlog.Kubernetes]] is a powerful container-orchestration system for application deployment.

The charts contain all pre-configured application resources along with all the versions into one easily manageable package.\n\nHelm streamlines installing, upgrading, fetching dependencies, and configuring deployments on Kubernetes with simple CLI commands. Software packages are found in repositories or are created.\n\nUnlike Homebrew or Aptitude desktop package managers, or Azure Resource Manager templates (ARMs) / Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) that are run on a single server, Helm charts are built atop Kubernetes and benefit from its cluster architecture. The main benefit of this approach is the ability to consider scalability from the start. The charts of all the images used by Helm are stored in a registry called Helm Workspace, so the DevOps teams can search them and add to their projects with ease.\n\nKubernetes objects are challenging to manage. With helpful tools, the Kubernetes learning curve becomes smooth and manageable.

By default, the owner is the user who creates the file and the group is the primary group of that user\n- The ownership of a file or a directory can be changed only by root using the [[devlog.chown]] and `chgrp` commands\n\n### For each file the permissions are assigned to three different categories of users:\n\n1.  The File owner\n2.  The Group owner\n3.  Others (anyone else or the whole world)\n\n### There are three file permissions types that apply to each category:\n\n- The read permission (r)\n- The write permission (w)\n- The execute permission (x)\n\n### To view the files permissions run: [[devlog.ls]] -l or [[devlog.stat]]\n\n- `-` indicates the absence of a permission\n- The order of permissions is `FileType` denoted with `d`, `l`, `-` etc followed by permissions for the user in the format `rwx` followed by permissions for the group followed by permissions for other users\n- `root` user can always `rwx` because permissions are always only for non-privileged users.\n- `x` all Linux commands or shell scripts have the `x` permission set. If a file that represents a command doesn't have `x` permission it cannot be executed.\n\n### Combining Find and Chmod Commands Together\n\nTo recursively set permissions for all files to a specific value, you should exclude the directories in the path otherwise the directories will have same permissions as the files, see: [[devlog.The Effect of Permissions on Directories]]\n\nTo mitigate this, we can combine [[devlog.find]] and [[devlog.chmod]] commands together\n\nExample\n\n- `find ~ -type f -exec chmod 640 {} \\;` for all files\n- `find ~ -type d -exec chmod 750 {} \\;` for all directories\n\n### Changing File Ownership\n\n- In Linux, all files are associated with an owner and a group owner\n- The [[devlog.chown]] and `chgrp` commands are used to change the files owner and group\n- Only root can change the file owner\n- Normal users can change the group of the file if they own the file and only to a group of which they are member of root can change the group ownership of all files.\n\n---\n\n### Special Permissions\n\n- Besides `r`, `w` and `x` for the owner, group and others there are 3 extra special permissions for each file or directory:\n  - [[devlog.suid]] or Set User ID\n  - [[devlog.SGID]] or Set Group ID\n  - [[devlog.Sticky Bit]]\n- These special permissions are for the file or directory overall, not just for a user category.\n\n### Special Permission - [[devlog.suid]]\n\n- **When an execuatable file with [[devlog.suid]] is executed then the resulting process will have the permissions of the owner of the command, not the permissions of the user who executes the command**.\n- Sometimes it is necessary for a system to temporarily treat a user as root which is where [[devlog.suid]] comes into play.\n  - [[devlog.passwd]] command has SUID set by default so that even nonpriviledged users can change their password.\n- Absolute Mode: `chmod 4xxx file`\n- Relative Mode: `chmod u+s file`\n- `ls -l /usr/bin/passwd`\n  - `-rwsr-xr-x 1 root root 68208 apr 16 15:36` /usr/bin/passwd\n\nFor example:\n\n`cat` will only be able to read a file if the user has the permissions to read the file.\n\n`ls -l /usr/bin/cat` the owner of the executable is `root` but it'll be run as per the privileges of the user that invokes the command.\n\nIn case of `/etc/shadow` file, `cat` will not be able to read the contents because it doesn't yet have the [[devlog.suid]] `s` set for it, so its not able to inherit the permissions of the `root`, even though `root` is the owner of the command `cat` but since [[devlog.suid]] is not set, it is inherting the permissions of the nonprivileged user.\n\nIf there is a `0` before the numeric value for \"Access\" when you run [[devlog.stat]] on a file, it means there are no special permissions set for that file.\n\n### Setting up SUID\n\n`sudo chmod 4755 /usr/bin/cat` using [[devlog.chmod]] setting the [[devlog.suid]] and checking with `ls -l /usr/bin/cat` will return `-rwsr-xr-x` with /usr/bin/cat in red(or different) color.\n\nIf you check with [[devlog.stat]] command you'll find \"Access\" with the value: `4755`\n\nSometimes you'll find an uppercase `S` instead of a lowercase `s` denoting that there are no `x` executable permissions for that file.\n\n#### SUID with symbolic mode\n\n`sudo chmod u+s /usr/bin/cat`\n\n### Finding all the commands with the SUID set\n\n`find /usr/bin -perm -4000` [[devlog.find]]\n\n### Special Permission - [[devlog.SGID]]\n\n- SGID or Set Group ID\n- SGID is set mainly to directories\n- If you set SGID on directories, all files or directories created inside that directory will be owned by the same group owner of the directory where SGID was configured.\n- This is useful in creating shared directories, which are directories that are writable at the group level.\n- Absolute Mode: `chmod 2xxx directory`\n- Relative Mode: `chmod g+s directory`\n- `ls -ld /programming/`\n  - `drwxrws---2 pr1 programmers 4096 iul 14 13:15 /programming/`\n\nFor example:\n\n- `sudo su`\n- `groupadd programmers`\n- `useradd -s /bin/bash pr1`\n- `useradd -s /bin/bash pr2`\n- `usermod -aG programmers pr1`\n- `usermod -aG programmers pr2`\n- `mkdir /programming/`\n- `chown pr1:programmers /programming/`\n- `chmod 770 /programming/`\n- `su pr1`\n- `cd /programming/`\n- `touch source1.cpp`\n\nAt this point the <span class=\"underline\">group owner of the file is the primary group of the creator</span> and the other users in the `programmers` group will not be able to change the file or work on it, we can give individual permissions to the other users but it can be a security issue.\n\n### Setting up SGID\n\n`chmod 2770 /programming` or `chmod g+s /programming`\n\nVerify with `ls -ld /programming` or `stat /programming`\n\nThere will be an additional `s` letter added to the permissions, if there is an uppercase `S` it means there are not execution permissions set for that directory.\n\n- `su pr2`\n- `cd /programming`\n- `touch source2.cpp`\n- `mkdir goland python`\n  -

applications.\n- Traditionally done in \"batches\" (every hour, day, week, mins or other intervals).\n- ETL is known as batch oriented data flow process.\n- When data is first brought in, it is in raw form(at); errors and all.\n- Land in data warehouse staging layer.\n\n### Transform\n\n- \"Apples to apples\"\n- Prepare for uniform data in user access layer\n- It can be very complex\n\n### Load\n\n- Final stop along the data pathway\n- Store uniform data in user access layer\n\n### Challenges with traditional ETL\n\n- Significant business analysis before storing data\n- Significant data modeling before storing data\n\n### ELT\n\n- \"Blast\" data into [[devlog.Big Data]] environment.\n- Bring in data in raw form in [[devlog.hadoop]], [[devlog.hdfs]], AWS S3, etc.\n- Use big data environment computing power to transform when needed.\n- \"Schema on read\" (ETL) vs \"Schema on write\" (ELT)\n- Mostly used when creating a [[Data Lake]] or hybrid data lakes.\n\n---\n\nThere are two types of ETL: _Initial_ Incremental\n\n### Initial ETL\n\n- Normally one time only\n- Right before the data warehouse goes live\n- All relevant data necessary for BI and analytics\n- Redo if data warehouse \"blows up\"\n\n### Incremental ETL\n\n- Incrementally \"refreshes\" the data warehouse\n- New data: employees, customers, products ...\n- Modified data: employee promotions, product price, change..\n- Special handling for deleted data: customer drops from a subscription plan...(not actually deleting)\n- Four major incremental ETL patterns\n  - Append\n  - In-place update (going into existing rows of data and updating them)\n  - Complete replacement\n  - Rolling append(maintaing a certain duration of history and wiping old data)\n- Most Incremental ETL done today is comprised only of:\n  - Append\n  - In-place update\n\n### Common transformation models\n\n- Data value unification\n- Data type and size unification\n- De-duplication\n- Dropping Columns(vertical slicing)\n-

were many different network technologies competing for a portion of the market share\n- Ethernet, Token Ring, FDDI and others fought for dominance\n- Currently, Ethernet is dominant for Layer 1\n\n### Origins of Ethernet\n\n- Was first run over [[devlog.Coax]] cables (10Base5, 10Base2), using vampire taps, BNC connectors.\n- Ethernet has changed to using [[devlog.Twisted Pair]] cables using [[devlog.UTP]], [[devlog.STP]]\n- 10BASE-T is [[devlog.UTP]] - max speed 10 Mbps and max distance 100 meters, this is clearly not enough\n\n### How should devices access the network?\n\n- Deterministic\n  - Very organized and orderly\n  - Need an electronic token to transmit\n  - For example: Token Ring\n- Contention-based\n  - Very chaotic\n  - Transmit (almost) whenever you want\n  - For example: [[devlog.Ethernet]]\n\n---\n\n### CSMA/CD\n\n- [[devlog.Ethernet]] devices transmit based on a principle called Carrier Sense Multiple Access/Collision Detect or CSMA/CD\n- Carrier Sense\n  - Listen to the wire, verify it is not busy\n- Multiple Access\n  - All devices have access at any time\n- Collision Detect\n  - If two deviecs transmit at the same time, a collision occurs\n  - Back off, wait a random time and try again\n\n---\n\n### Collision Domains\n\n- Comprised of all devices on shared [[devlog.Ethernet]] segment (everything on same cable or [[devlog.Hub]])\n- Devices operate at half-duplex when connected to a [[devlog.Hub]] (Layer 1 Device)\n- Devices must listen before they transmit to avoid collisions when operating as `CSMA/CD`\n- The larger the Collision Domain, the more chaos in the network.\n- Collision Domains need to broken down into smaller chunks for more efficiency\n\n---\n\n### Collision Domains on [[devlog.Switch]]es\n\n- [[devlog.Ethernet]] [[devlog.Switch]]es increase scalability of the network by creating multiple collision domains\n- Each port on a switch is a Collision Domain, no chance of collisions and increases speed\n- Switches can operate in full-duplex mode\n\n---\n\n### Collision Domains on [[devlog.Hub]]s\n\n- [[devlog.Hub]]s were used to connect multiple network segments together\n- Each [[devlog.LAN]] segment becomes a separate [[devlog.Collision Domains]]\n- As the network gets larger in which a [[devlog.Hub]] is being utilized to connect all the machines, the network will get more chaotic as [[devlog.Hub]] don't break up [[devlog.Collision Domains]], it'll be treated as one large collision domain.\n- To deal with this issue a [[devlog.Bridge]] needs to be introduced to the network.\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zubayrrr/twiki/main/bin/image.cqfqt7rooe6.png)\n\n---\n\n### Speed Limitations\n\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr class=\"header\">\n<th style=\"text-align:

Therefore, containers are dependent on images and use them to construct a run-time environment and run an application.\n\nThe two concepts exist as essential components (or rather phases) in the process of running a Docker container. Having a running container is the final “phase” of that process, indicating it is dependent on previous steps and components. That is why docker images essentially govern and shape containers.\n\nContainer is the running environment for(of) an image. Container has application image, a port binded to it(makes it possible for it to talk to the application running inside it), Containers has virtual FS.\n\nSee also: [[devlog.containers & images]]\n\n## Docker cli\n\n- Run `docker info`, `docker --version` or `docker version` to check it's version and if the client is able to communicate with the server.\n- The new way of running docker commands is:\n\n  - First comes the `docker` command followed by a `management command` and then a `sub command` with options\n  - Run `docker help` to find all commands, sub commands\n\n- To test docker run the `hello-world` container\n  - `docker container run hello-world`\n- To search for an image on docker hub\n  - `docker search mongo`\n- To pull an image\n  - `docker image pull redis` is same as `docker image pull redis:latest`\n  - `docker image pull redis:5.0.10` `:tag`(optional)\n- To list all images\n  - `docker images` or `docker image ls`\n- To run an container from(of) an image\n  - `docker container run redis`\n- To pull an image and run container\n  - `docker container run -P httpd` (`-P` to publish all exposed ports to random ports)\n- The above command executed in two steps\n\n  - `docker container create -p 80:80 httpd`\n  - `docker container start CONTAINER_ID`\n\n- To get a shell inside docker\n  - `docker container run -it centos`(if you run it without passing any commands it'll simply exit, `-it` is required for shell access of the container)\n- Get terminal of the container\n\n  - `docker exec -it CONTAINER_ID /bin/bash`\n  - `docker exec -it CONTAINER_ID /bin/sh`\n\n- To give your container a custom name(default is random)\n\n  - `docker run -d -p 6001:6379 --name redis-olderv redis:4.0`\n\n- To list all running docker containers\n  - `docker ps` or `docker container ls`\n  - `ps` stands for process status\n- To list all docker containers\n  - `docker ps -a` or `docker container ls -a`\n- To filter by status run\n  - `docker container ls -a -f status=exited`\n- To list only container IDs\n\n  - `docker container ls -a -f status=exited -q` -q comes from quiet\n\n- To remove image and the container\n  - First stop and then remove the container\n  - `docker container stop CONTAINER_ID`\n  - You don't have to write the entire container ID, the first few digits as long as they're unique\n  - `docker container rm CONTAINER_ID` to remove the container\n- To remove a running container `docker container rm -f CONTAINER_ID`\n- To remove using filter use command substitution\n  - `docker container rm $(docker container ls -a -f status=exited -q)`\n- To remove an image\n\n  - `docker rmi` or `docker image rm IMAGE_NAME` (`-f` to forcefully remove a still running container's image)\n  - If you try to remove an image that is stopped or running, it'll throw an error, you'll need to remove the container before removing it's image.\n\n- To view logs of a container(useful for debugging):\n  - `docker container logs CONTAINER_ID`\n  - `docker container logs -f CONTAINER_NAME` (`-f` to view them in realtime)\n- To view all the process running inside a container:\n  - `docker container top CONTAINER_NAME`\n  - `docker container top CONTAINER_ID`\n  - You can look for the same processes running on the host machine(even the process IDs are same)\n- To display realtime info about running containers:\n  - `docker container stats`\n  - `docker container stats CONTAINER_NAME` (for info about specific container)\n- To view more info about containers\n\n  - `docker container inspect CONTAINER_NAME/ID`\n  - Filter using [[devlog.grep]]\n  - `docker container inspect CONTAINER_NAME/ID | grep -i ipaddress`\n\n- To commit changes to a container's image:\n  - `docker commit -m \"commit message\" -a \"author name\" CONTAINER_ID repo_name/image_name:latest`\n  - You can now use the newly created image with your committed changes.\n- To add a custom tag to an existing image(**doesn't** create a new image, will point towards the image with the same ID):\n  - `docker image tag image_name repo_name/image_name:new_tag`\n  - `docker image tag repo_name/image_name:old_tag repo_name/image_name:new_tag`\n- To push the image to docker hub:\n  - The repo name used must match the username on docker hub\n  - `docker login`\n  - `docker image push repo_name/image_name:tag`\n- To rename an image (makes a copy, points to the same image ID)\n  - `docker tag my-app:1.0 new-my-app:1.1.0`\n\n## Docker Hub\n\nImage name follows the convention of `repository/image_name:tag` but official images don't follow this structure as they're at the root level.\n\nImage ID is used to identify docker images, a single image can have multiple tags pointing to the same image.\nDocker Image ID is a digest which contains the [[devlog.sha256]] hash of the image.\n\n## Dangling Images\n\n- Docker images consist of multiple layers. Dangling images are layers that have no relationship to any tagged images.\n- To delete dangling images, stopped containers and networks not used by at least one container run:\n  - `docker system prune`\n- `docker system prune -a` to remove unused images as well\n- An image consists of multiple layers. They're read-only and each has an ID.\n- A layer is saved only once and can be used by more than one image. (This saves disk space and time when pulling images.)\n- They layers are stacked on top of each other.\n- When you run a container from an image, a new writeable layer is added on top of the image layers.\n- This writeable layer is often called \"Container Layer\" and allows you to make changes to the container since the lower layers on the image are read-only.\n- When we remove a container, we're in fact only removing the writeable layer.\n- To write data to the writeable layer of the container, docker uses \"Storage Drivers\"\n- `overlay2` is the default and recommended driver.\n- To view the layers of an image:\n  - `docker image inspect image_name`\n  - On disk, the layers are located at `/var/lib/docker/overlay2`\n- There are two different values under \"SIZE\" when `docker container ls` is run\n  - The first value represents the amount of data used for the writeable layer of each container.\n  - The \"Virtual\" size represents the amount of data for the read-only image layers plus the container's writeable layer's size\n- Multiple containers may share some or all read-only image data, and two containers started from same image share 100% of the read-only data.\n\n## Image ID\n\nA Docker image's ID is a digest, which contains an SHA256 hash of the image's JSON configuration object.\n\n## Container\n\n- A container when it starts executes a default command, as long as the container's default command is running it'll stay up. Once the command finishes execution, the container will also exit.\n- To get access to a shell of a container use `-it` flags, `i` for interactive and `t` for [[devlog.tty]].\n- To escape from a running container without stopping the container use `CTRL + P + Q`\n- To execute commands on a running container:\n  - `docker container exec -it CONTAINER_ID bash` or\n  - `docker container exec CONTAINER_ID cat /etc/shadow`\n\n## Persistent Data / Docker Volumes\n\nContainers have Virtual FS inside them.\n\nBy default, all files created inside a container are stored on the writeable container layer. The data doesn't persist when the container no longer exists(stops, removed, restarted) and it can be difficult to get the data out of the container if another process needs it.\n\nDocker provides two options for the container to store data in the host machine, to make data persist.\n\n1. Volumes\n2. Bind Mounts\n\nVolumes are preferred over Bind Mounts. While **Bind Mounts** are dependent on the directory structure and the OS of the host machine. Volumes are completely managed by Docker. **A Volume is a persistent directory of a container. Its a mapping between a directory on the docker host and a directory on a container.** To create a volume you mount a physical folder from the host into the virtual file system of Docker. Data is written on the host dir.\n\nThere are different ways of creating Docker Volumes:\n\n- We can create volume by defining it in the Dockerfile using the `VOLUME` instruction.\n- By using `-v` flag when starting(`docker run`) a container and mapping a host dir to a to a dir in the container. These are called **Host Volumes**\n- You don't specify which host dir should be mounted, its created by Docker itself inside `/var/lib/docker/volumes`. These are called **Anonymous Volumes**. For each container a folder is generated that gets mounted. Anonymous Volumes will have a hash as a name.\n- You can specify a name for an autogenerated volume by `docker run -v name:/var/lib/mysql/data`. There are called **Named Volumes**.\n- You can also create them when using `docker-compose` using the `volumes` definition under a declared container. You can also define a list of volumes you want that `docker-compose` file to create so you can reference the same volume on different containers.\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/zubayr/image/upload/v1657894394/wiki/cwwndvvg1gypnj1wx3p7.png)\n\nWhen you mount a volume, they can be named or anonymous. Anonymous volumes are not given an explicit name when they're first mounted into a container; docker gives them a random name that is guaranteed to be unique within a given docker host.\n\n- `docker volume create volumeName`\n- `docker volume ls` - to list all volumes\n- `docker volume inspect volumeName` - info about a volume, like where the data on the volume is physically located on the drive.\n- `docker volume rm volumeName`\n- `docker volume prune` (will remove all unused volumes)\n\nThe directory on the host that is being used as the mount point can be found at `/var/lib/docker/volumes/`\n\n- Starting a container with a volume.\n\n`docker container run -d --name mywebapp -p 80:80 -v mysite:/usr/share/ngnix/html nginx`\n\nYour website's html is copied TO the container's `/usr/share/ngnix/html` (in the above example) for it to be served.\n\n## Docker Layers\n\n- Docker format gives assets unique identifiers called Docker Layers\n- Docker Layers == Assets\n- Assets can be **reused** for different components\n  - E.g. if two Docker Images use same layers, you’d have 2 components that share the layer as an asset.\n- A Docker Layer can be specific OS, referenced by multiple Docker Images.\n\n## Container Port VS Host Port\n\nMultiple containers(even same images) can run on your host machine. Host machine has certain ports that can be opened.\n\nA binding needs to be created between your host machine and the container.\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/zubayr/image/upload/v1657823871/wiki/geibagpoa2uvx95wwaxg.png)\n\nYou can specify the binding of the port along with the run command.\n\n`docker run -p HostPort:ContainerPort image`\n\n`docker run -p 6000:6379 redis`\n\n## Docker Network\n\nDocker creates it’s own isolated Docker Network where the containers are running. When you deploy two containers in the same Docker Network, they can talk to each other using the Container name.\n\nApplications outside of the Docker Network connect using localhost and port number.\n\nIn production, this application running/developed outside of the Network is also added to the Network.\n\n`docker network ls` list networks (some are autogenerated)\n\n`docker network create mongo-network` to create a new network\n\nMake a container run inside a Network\n\n`docker run -p 27017:27017 -d mongo`\n\n## Docker Compose\n\nDocker Compose file is basically a bunch of docker commands structured nicely so you don’t have to run each of those docker run commands one by one.\n\n`docker-compose` is a `yaml` file.\n\nDocker compose creates a common network for all the containers mentioned inside it.\n\n```yaml\nversion:'3' # version of docker-compose\nservices: # here goes the containers\n\tmongodb: # name of a container\n\t\timage: mongo # name of the image\n\t\tports:\n\t\t\t- 27017:27017 # HOST:CONTAINER\n\t\tenvironment: # env variables\n\t\t\t- MONGO_USERNAME=admin\n\t\t\t- ...\n\tmongo-express:\n\t\timage: mongo-express\n\t\tports:\n\t\t\t- 8080:8080\n\t\tenvironment:\n\t\t\t- ME_CONFIG:value\n```\n\nStart Docker container using docker-compose file.\n\n`docker-compose -f mongo.yaml up`\n\n## Dockerfile\n\n- It is a text file that contains all the instructions needed to create an image. A recipe for creating docker images.\n- The syntax it uses is from Docker platform and uses statements to generate docker images.\n- It also runs bash commands (single line which uses `&&` to append commands and `\\` backslash for a newline.)\n- To use a Dockerfile for a custom image, copy paste the instructions from an existing Dockerfile locally and remove the `COPY` instructions to adapt it for your custom image with your own instructions.\n- To build an image from the custom Dockerfile:\n  - `docker image build -t myimage:1.0 .`\n  - You should have a Dockerfile in the current working dir.\n\nThe specific commands you can use in a dockerfile are:\n\nFROM, PULL, RUN, and CMD\n\n- FROM - Creates a layer from the ubuntu:18.04\n- PULL - Adds files from your Docker repository\n- RUN - Builds your container(you can use multiple of these)\n- CMD - Specifies what command to run within the container (entrypoint, only one)\n- ENV - to define environment variables\n\n## Private Docker Repository\n\n- Creating a private docker repository on [[devlog.AWS ECR]]\n\n## Misc\n\nDocker for Mac creates a Linux VM and stores data there.\n\n## Examples\n\n- [[devlog.Running a Web Server in a Docker Container]]\n- [[devlog.Connecting a Nodejs application to a MongoDB Docker container]]\n- [[devlog.Docker repository on Nexus]]\n- [[devlog.Nexus as Docker container]]\n\n## Resources\n\n- [Play with Docker](https://labs.play-with-docker.com/)\n- [Docker Networking Security Basics | dockerlabs](https://dockerlabs.collabnix.com/advanced/security/networking/)\n- [Docker Compose Cheatsheet – Collabnix](https://collabnix.com/docker-compose-cheatsheet/)\n- [Docker Cheatsheet – Collabnix](https://collabnix.com/docker-cheatsheet/)\n","n":0.021}}},{"i":1083,"$":{"0":{"v":"Docker Swarm","n":0.707}}},{"i":1084,"$":{"0":{"v":"DNS","n":1},"1":{"v":"\n- Areas: [[areas.networking]],[[devlog.linux]]\n\n---\n\n- Domain Name Service operates on [[Port 53]]\n- Hierarchical decentralized naming system for computers, services, or other resources connected to the internet or a private network.\n- Converts domain names to [[devlog.ip address]]es\n\n- On the latest version of Ubuntu, the DNS is under the control of [[systemd-resolve]] [[devlog.daemon]].\n- A service that provides DNS name resolution to local services and applications and can be configured with [[devlog.netplan]], the default network management tool on Ubuntu.\n- To display the DNS server used by the system:\n  - `systemd-resolve --status`\n\n---\n\nThe Domain Name System (DNS) turns domain names into IP addresses, which browsers use to load internet pages. Every device connected to the internet has its own IP address, which is used by other devices to locate the device.\n\nIn the first step DNS resolver, also called recursive resolver designed to receive DNS queries from a web browser and other applications. The resolver receives a hostname, for example, **www.example.com**, and is responsible for tracking down the IP addresses for that hostname.\n\nAfter that root server is translating human-readable hostname into IP addresses. There are 13 logical root servers worldwide, denoted by letter A through M controlled by Cogen, the University of Maryland, and the U.S arm lab. The TLD nameserver takes the domain provided in the query and provides the IP of an authoritative name server. The authoritative name server takes the domain name and subdomain, and it returns the correct IP address to the DNS resolver.\n\n## DNS Records\n\n- [Why Do Some Websites Start With WWW1?

A fleet can launch multiple instance(mixed set) types across multiple Availability Zones using On-Demand Instance, Reserved Instance and Spot Instance purchasing options together.\n\nIn the configuration you can define:\n\n- Separate capacity targets and maximum amount you're willing to pay per hour for On-Demand, Spot instances.\n- Specify the instance types that work best for your applications.\n- Specify how EC2 should distribute your fleet capacity within each purchasing options.\n\nThe instance fleet configuration for [[devlog.AWS EMR]] lets you select wide variety of provisioning options for Amazon EC2 instances and helps you develop a flexible and elastic resourcing strategy for each node type in your cluster.\n\n5. **How do you pass “message” for your git commit**\n\nUse the flag `-m [message]` for your [[devlog.git]] commit. Although you can commit without passing a message.\n\n`git commit -m \"🔥 commit message\"`\n\n6. **What application server are you familiar with?**\n\n[[devlog.web server & application server]]\n\nFor Java applications, we have [[devlog.tomcat]] but there are different application servers for applications based on different technologies.\n\n7. **How to check logs of a Docker container/filter last 200 lines from the logs.**\n\n`docker container logs <container_name>`\n`docker container logs --tail 200 <container_name>`\n\n8. **What happens to container logs if it is restarted?**\n\nYou won’t lose any logs for restarting a container but since containers are stateless, you will lose the logs if a container is **deleted**. If you want to persist logs you can use external persistent storage. You can also push the container logs to something like [[devlog.AWS CloudTrail]] or [[devlog.splunk]]\n\n9. **Horizontal Scaling VS Vertical Scaling**\n\n**Horizontal scaling** means scaling by adding more machines to your pool of resources (also described as “scaling out”); something like [[devlog.AWS Auto Scaling Group]], creating replicas(think [[devlog.kubernetes]]). If you are hosting an application on a server and find that it no longer has the capacity or capabilities to handle traffic, adding a server may be your solution.\n\nWhereas **vertical scaling** refers to scaling by adding more power (e.g. CPU, RAM) to an existing machine (also described as “scaling up”). For instance, if your server requires more processing power, vertical scaling would mean upgrading the CPUs. You can also vertically scale the memory, storage, or network speed.\n\nSee: [Horizontal Vs. Vertical Scaling: How Do They Compare?](https://www.cloudzero.com/blog/horizontal-vs-vertical-scaling)\n\n10. **ReplicationController in Kubernetes**\n\nA ReplicationController is responsible for running the specified number of pod copies(replicas) across the cluster.\n\nReplicationController is not auto scale.\n\n```yaml\napiVersion: v1\nkind: ReplicationController\nmetadata:\n  name: nginx\nspec:\n  replicas: 3\n  selector:\n    app: nginx\n  template:\n    metadata:\n      name: nginx\n      labels:\n        app: nginx\n    spec:\n      containers:\n        - name: nginx\n          image: nginx\n          ports:\n            - containerPort: 80\n```\n\n11. **What is helm?**\n\n![[devlog.helm]]\n\n12. **Which Python module would you use to write a simple program to test API code?**\n\nThe code should just check if the API endpoint is working or not.\n\n**Answer:**\n\nI would use the **request** module in [[devlog.python]]. It has the `get()` function wherein you'd pass pass the API endpoint and fetch status/http code `.status_code`.\n\nIf it returns `200` - API endpoint is working fine.\n\n13. **Which HTTP responses would you monitor and for which would you trigger alerts?**\n\nExample of API endpoints:\n\n```\n/this-is-an-endpoint\n/another/endpoint\n/some/other/endpoint\n/login\n/accounts\n/cart/items\n```\n\nHTTP response status codes indicate whether a specific HTTP request has been successfully completed. Responses are grouped in five classes:\n\n- Informational responses (100–199)\n- Successful responses (200–299)\n- Redirection messages (300–399)\n- Client error responses (400–499)\n- Server error responses (500–599)\n\n- If HTTP response is in the 400 or 500 range we'll trigger an alert by writing a script of setting up a monitoring service.\n\n14. **Can we run a Jenkins agent inside a docker container along with our test?**\n\n- Running Jenkins agent inside a [[devlog.Docker]] container is (one of) the standard way of implementing pipelines.\n- This question is focusing on isolation of pipeline steps.\n- Here the code is expected to run inside a docker container which can use a custom test image if required.\n- This is the best way to perform testing without having every [[devlog.Jenkins]] agent needing to have packages installed.\n- To use any kind of Docker containers, I'd add it as a part of the agent. We can call any kind of images(from DockerHub or Custom), whatever stages and test steps we mention as part of our pipeline will run inside that docker container. Multi node Jenkins setup.\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/zubayr/image/upload/v1655971387/wiki/m9mcgppau59fyaewl0uw.png)\n\n15. **What are some of the ways of setting up alerts?**\n\nIt is not feasible to have multiple alerting methods in one org. Alerts notifications can be Emails, Phone calls, Slack messages, etc. This ties into the [[devlog.on-call]] management.\n\nSome of the open source methods:\n\n- [[devlog.prometheus]] -> Alertmanager\n- [[devlog.AWS CloudWatch]] -> SNS\n- Nagios -> Alerting\n\n16. **Help repository to store/access helm charts**\n\nHelm repositories are a common practice to store helm charts, which can be access by our [[devlog.kubernetes]] cluster as part of a deployment. This helps with versioning our helm charts, rollbacks, upgrade etc.\n\n- Cloudsmith\n- Jfrog Artifactory\n- [[devlog.AWS S3]]\n- Google Cloud Storage\n- Artifact Hub(Open Source)\n\n17. **Jenkins multi-node setup, how to add new slave/follower to master?**\n\nHaving only one node is usually not enough(availability) for any organization so a multi-node setup is required for scaling. You can add a slave/follower for a master on \"Manage [[devlog.Jekins]]\" page and the option \"Manage Nodes and Clouds\". You will provide node info such as the IP Address, username, password etc and get it registered. We can also add slaves dynamically, you'd need an auto scaling group by your Cloud Provider.\n\n18. **How do you block an IAM user from accessing a specific S3 bucket?**\n\nIt is difficult to manage bucket level policies using IAM policy. We can achieve this using [[devlog.AWS S3]] bucket policy, you'd use the IAM user's ARN and “deny” the user.\n\n19. **Is a large docker image a cause of concern? How would you tackle it?**\n\nApplications can be large if they're complex and do a lot of things but if it is a simple application...large size is not warranted and can be mitigated.\n\n- Bigger docker image would result in longer build time.\n- Docker image downloaded(from DockerHub) may throw errors or cause API rate limit issues.\n- Application will be bulkier and harder to debug and scale.\n\nTo resolve this:\n\n- Smaller Base Image(Alpine images).\n- Introduce Multi-stage build - from the Base image you build up your image and discard your previous image builds.\n- Remove package binaries after installing and don't install packages that are not necessary.\n- Lock your package/dependencies versions.\n\n20. **Are you aware of AWS IAM policies/can you read them?**\n\nPolicy evaluation logic\n\nExample\n\n```json\n{\n  \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\", // version is fixed\n  \"Statement\": [\n    {\n      \"Sid\": \"AllowS3ListRead\", // high level ALLOW action\n      \"Effect\": \"Allow\",\n      \"Action\": [\n        \"s3:GetBucketLocation\", // explicitly defining what actions are allowed\n        \"s3:GetAccountPublicAccessBlock\",\n        \"s3:ListAccessPoints\",\n        \"s3:ListAllMyBuckets\"\n      ],\n      \"Resource\": \"arn:aws:s3:::*\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"Sid\": \"AllowS3Self\", // high level ALLOW action\n      \"Effect\": \"Allow\",\n      \"Action\": \"s3:*\", // everything is allowed but only limited to the below two buckets\n      \"Resource\": [\"arn:aws:s3:::carlossalazar/*\", \"arn:aws:s3:::carlossalazar\"]\n    },\n    {\n      \"Sid\": \"DenyS3Logs\", // high level DENY action\n      \"Effect\": \"Deny\",\n      \"Action\": \"s3:*\", // everything is denied for any bucket with the suffix \"logs\"\n      \"Resource\": \"arn:aws:s3:::*log*\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nExample via - [Policy evaluation logic - AWS Identity and Access Management](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_evaluation-logic.html)\n\n21. **What role does `pv` and `pvc` play in Kubernetes?**\n\nPV stands for PersistentVolume\nPVC stands for PersistentVolumeClaim\n\nPod gets it's storage using PVC which would in turn get hold of PV which will utilize an NFS or [[devlog.AWS EBS]] volume.\n\nPVC will define what kind of volume and the storage amount it needs and it will search of PVs(which you'd have provisioned) and choose from those.\n\nPV can exist independently from a Pod, you don't need to have a Pod for a PV to be created.\n\n22. **When creating RDS using Terraform, how do you save DB username and password securely?**\n\nSince DB username and password are considered secrets, they cannot be saved in plaintext on a repository along with the Terraform code.\n\nYou can use Hashicorp's Vault, store your secrets on your Vault.\n\nIntegrate it with Terraform. In your `main.tf` you can reference it as a Data Block. Mention Vault provider in the Provider section.\n\nYou can also use other secret stores/managers like [[devlog.AWS Secrets Manager]] etc. Or you can also use environment variables.\n\n23. **Have you support any DBs?**\n\nYou don't need to be a DB expert but you have to have clear understanding of different kinds of DBs used, their use cases and pick one based on your experience and profile.\n\n- Key-value DB\n  - [[devlog.Redis]], etcd\n- Column DB\n  - Cassandra\n- NoSQL/Document/Schemaless DB\n  - [[devlog.mongoDB]]\n  - [[devlog.AWS DynamoDB]]\n- Relational DB\n  - [[devlog.mysql]]\n  - [[devlog.AWS Aurora]]\n  - [[devlog.PostgreSQL]]\n\n24. **How do you ensure certain packages are installed on all your EC2 instances and are persisted?**\n\nHashiCorp's [[devlog.Packer]] is the solution. Packer is an open source tool that enables you to create identical machine images for multiple platforms from a single source template which can be written in JSON. You can use it in your multi-cloud setup or On-prem infra too.\n\nA common use case is creating \"Golden Images\" that teams across an organization can use in cloud infrastructure.\n\nWe could also use custom [[devlog.AWS AMI]] images too but is limited to Cloud.\n\n25. **Differentiate Managed, Customer Managed and Inline IAM policies.**\n\n- Managed: Created and maintained by AWS.\n- Customer Managed: Created and maintained by customer. Custom policies created by an organization using [[devlog.terraform]]. It can be attached to multiple users or groups.\n- Inline: Created and attached directly to IAM User, Group or Role. It is created for that specific Role, User, Group ...if the Role, User or Group is destroyed, the policy is also deleted.\n\n26. **What build tools are you familiar with?**\n\n![[devlog.build automation# Building-Java-Applications:# Publishing-build-artifacts]]\n\n26. **Ingress and Egress**\n\n[[archive.ingress]] and [[archive.egress]]\n\nIn IT they refer to:\n\nIngress: Incoming/Inbound traffic\nEgress: Outgoing/Outbound traffic\n\nThey're mostly associated with security groups([[devlog.firewall]]). They're also associated with VPCs and subnets where we control the incoming traffic from the internet and routing the traffic between subnets.\n\nEg: Allowing or denying ports for certain traffic([[devlog.ssh]], [[devlog.http]]). In prod, you'd usually lock it in the VPC IP Range.\n\n27. **Differentiate Docker Image and Docker Layer.**\n\n- Docker Layers are not separate components, you cannot have a single Docker Layer and use it. They're a subcomponent of a Docker Image.\n- But an Image can consist of a single Layer(that's often the case when running `squash` command)\n- Each Layer is an Image by itself.\n- They're generated when you run `docker container` commands.\n- Each Layer stores the changes compared to the image it's based on `docker history` can fetch you info on it's Layers.\n- Each instruction in a Dockerfile results in a layer.\n\n28. **What is bastion host or gateway server and what roles do they play?**\n\n![[devlog.bastion host]]\n\n29. **How do you troubleshoot an Auto Scaling Group that is facing issues provisioning new nodes(it is using spot instances)?**\n\nHaving an [[devlog.AWS Auto Scaling Group]] full of only spot instances is not a good idea unless the application can bear a little bit of downtime or have a back up ASG.\n\nThere could be two of many causes for this:\n\n- Increase in spot price\n- EC2 quota limit\n\nSpot instances an be taken away from you if there is a change in bid price. Bidding high doesn't guarantee yous spot instances.\n\nThere is a soft limit set of every account on how many EC2 instances you can spin up. It can be mitigated by going to AWS Support and raise a ticket for increasing quota limit.\n\n30. **Troubleshoot a Pod that is unable to access a volume due to access error.**\n\nVolumes are handled/provisioned in Kubernetes as a part of PVs.\n\nAccessMode of volume - see that your PVC or your volume supports `ReadWriteMany` permission for multi-pod access.\n\nThe access modes are:\n\n- `ReadWriteOnce` the volume can be mounted as read-write by a single node. ReadWriteOnce access mode can still allow multiple pods to access the volume when the pods are running on the same node.\n- `ReadOnlyMany` the volume can be mounted as read-only by many nodes.\n- `ReadWriteMany` the volume can be mounted as read-write by many nodes.\n- `ReadWriteOncePod` the volume can be mounted as read-write by a single Pod. Use ReadWriteOncePod access mode if you want to ensure that only one pod across whole cluster can read that PVC or write to it. This is only supported for CSI volumes and Kubernetes version 1.22+.\n\n- [[devlog.NFS]] allows `ReadWriteMany`.\n- [[devlog.AWS EBS]] only allows `ReadWriteOnce`.\n\n31. **How to setup K8s in AWS?**\n\nYou can set them up directly on [[devlog.AWS EC2]]. Using either `kops` commands or `kubeadmin`. Or you can go with [[devlog.AWS EKS]].\n\nIf you want to set it up locally you'd go for `minicube`.\n\nIn prod we look for stability of our environment, hence the safest bet would be to go with a managed service such as EKS. For development you can go with [kOps](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops) clusters.\n\nCode deployment should be taken care by [[devlog.helm]].\n\n32. **Explain Load Balancers in AWS.**\n\n![[devlog.load balancer]]\n\n![[devlog.AWS ELB]]\n\n33. **Have you used sonarqube?**\n\n![[devlog.sonarqube]]\n\n34. **Best practices for Incident Management.**\n\nApplications expose metrics, metrics are collected using monitoring system, we have alert rules to trigger a phone call, Slack notification or email to the [[devlog.on-call]] engineer.\n\nThe organization should have a proper:\n\n- Monitoring system\n  - [[devlog.AWS CloudWatch]]\n  - [[devlog.prometheus]]\n- Alerting system\n  - SNS\n  - AlertManager\n\nPostmortem: Understand what went wrong and how to mitigate in the future.\n\n35. **How to validate variables during terraform plan time, for example format of the variable?**\n\nIn [[devlog.terraform]] you can define a `validation` block and specify a condition for the variable.\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/zubayr/image/upload/v1656067537/wiki/heqtzp8ccvxdlfsaqsbx.png)\n\nScenario: String may not contain a /.\n\n```json\nvariable \"string_may_not_contain\" {\n  type = string\n  default = \"test\"\n\n  validation {\n    error_message = \"Value cannot contain a \\\"/\\\".\"\n    condition = !can(regex(\"/\", var.string_may_not_contain))\n  }\n}\n```\n\nExample via - [Terraform: Variable validation with samples](https://dev.to/drewmullen/terraform-variable-validation-with-samples-1ank)\n\n36. **Explain/Differentiate `CMD` and `ENTRYPOINT` in Docker.**\n\nThe CMD command​ specifies the instruction that is to be executed when a Docker container starts. This CMD command is not really necessary for the container to work, as the echo command can be called in a RUN statement as well. The main purpose of the CMD command is to launch the software required in a container.\n\nCMD commands are ignored by Daemon when there are parameters stated within the docker run command.\n\nCMD. Sets default parameters that can be overridden from the Docker Command Line Interface (CLI) when a container is running.\n\nYou can pass input from CMD to ENTRYPOINT.\n\n```bash\n# CMD\nFROM ubuntu:latest\nCMD[\"echo\", \"Hello World!\"]\n```\n\nENTRYPOINT\n\nIt is a directive or instruction that is used to specify the executable which should run when a container is started from a Docker image. It has two forms, the first one is the ‘exec’ form and the second one is the ‘shell’ form. If there is no entrypoint or CMD specified in the Docker image, it starts and exits at the same time that means container stops automatically so, we must have to specify entrypoint or CMD so that when we will start the container it should execute or it'll stop.\n\nWe can override the ENTRYPOINT instruction while starting the container using the ‘–entrypoint’ flag. Also if we have multiple ENTRYPOINT instructions mentioned in Dockerfile then the last ENTRYPOINT will have an effect.\n\nYou can run shell scripts using ENTRYPOINT and pass it's output to CMD\n\n```bash\nFROM ubuntu\nRUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y nginx\nENTRYPOINT [\"nginx\", \"-g\", \"daemon off;\"]\n```\n\nBoth run during docker container runtime. Using either one of them is best practice but they can be combined too.\n\n37. **Troubleshoot EC2 instance in an ASG that are getting terminated.**\n\nIf EC2 quota and pricing is not the issue:\n\nEC2 instances get terminated if they're unhealthy.EC2 instances can become unhealthy if:\n\n- Disk space being full.\n- High CPU usage.\n- No memory left.\n\nTo debug\n\n- Run [[devlog.top]] command to see CPU utilization, check what process/application is using up the resources. Take this up with your developer.\n- Disk space EBS volume could be full and and OS might be running out of all disk space.\n- Run [[devlog.free]] command to check if any swap memory is left or not, you might want to increase it.\n\nSee: [[devlog.create and use swap file on linux]]\n\n38. **How to control of deployment of pods on nodes that are going to be used explicitly for those pods?**\n\n- We can achieve this by using **Taints and Tolerance** in K8's.\n- A taint when attached to a node, will ripple pods from getting provisioned or getting accepted.\n- We can add a taint to a pod `kubectl taint nodes nodex key=value:Effect`\n- Taints are properties of nodes that push pods away if they don't tolerate this taint.\n- Like labels, one or more Taints can be applied to a node. The node must not accept any pod that doesn't tolerate all of these taints.\n\n40. **You've 2 different servers with different ports and usernames, how do you use ansible runbook/playbook on both of the servers?**\n\nIn our `ansible.conf` we can define different `ansible_user` and `ansible_port` in the hostfile.\n\n```conf\n[webservers]\n10.4.20.90 ansible_port=4000 ansible_user=roger\n39.12.3.23 ansible_port=8001 ansible_user=liam\n```\n\n41. **What is Terraform state lock?**\n\nIf supported by your backend, [[devlog.Terraform]] will lock your state for all operations that could write state. This prevents others from acquiring the lock and potentially corrupting your state. State locking happens automatically on all operations that could write state.\n\nYou won't see any logs of when/as this happens. If state locking fails, Terraform will continue.\n\nYou can disable state locking for most commands with the `-lock` flag but it is not recommended. If acquiring the lock is taking longer than expected, Terraform will output a status message. If Terraform doesn't output a message, state locking is still occurring if your backend supports it.\n\n42. **How do you setup slack notifications on Jekins?**\n\nYou can leverage Jenkins plugins, you can use the Jenkins - Slack plugin and use Slack webhook URL.\nWhenever a pipeline job fails:\n`slackSend color: \"failure\", message: \"Pipeline failed, critical.\"\n\n43. **How do you see your trajectory as a DevOps Engineer?**\n\nThere is always something to learn. You could mention some of the tools/technologies that you want to learn - some you want to better understand. Show them that you are someone who is looking to constantly improve himself/herself(themselves).\n\nYou'd want to collaborate with your senior engineers to learn from them directly. Maybe you want to take up more responsibility in the organization etc.\n\n44. **How to ignore a certain part of our ansible playbook that might fail and cause our playbook to exit?**\n\nWe can achieve this using `ignore_errors` sub arguments.\n\n```yaml\n- name: Do not count this as a failure\n  ansible.builtin.command: /bin/false\n    ignore_errors: yes\n```\n\n45. **When making a change to existing code what is a `git` best practice?**\n\nGit clone the repo, checkout the respective branch. Make your change and commit your changes. To understand the motivation behind the change and the history, you can use `git blame`.\n\nThe git blame command is used to examine the contents of a file line by line and see when each line was last modified and who the author of the modifications was. Basically gives you the history and the author of the file.\n\n46. **At a high level, create an shell script to automatically push certain logs to S3 at a particular time.**\n\nThis is a Whiteboard design question.\n\n- Firstly, we'd make sure what we're using, IAM role or access keys.\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\n\n# assign path-to-logs to a variable\n\n# use aws CLI commands to copy files to S3\n\n# aws s3 cp <path-to-logs> <s3-bucket>\n\n# use cron job to execute the script at a particular time\n```\n\n47. **What is a package in Python?**\n\nThe module is a simple Python file that contains collections of functions and global variables and with having a .py extension file.

The more data sources, the more complex the data warehouse.\n- Data is copied, not moved.(Copies of data is sent into the warehouse)\n\n### It is more than just a storage for data:\n\n- A datawarehouse is an integrated environment; data from a number of sources is sent into a data warehouse.\n- Data warehouse should be subject oriented, regardless of how many systems the data is coming from.\n- Time variant\n  - Data warehouse should contain historical data and not just current data.\n- Non volatile\n  - Traditionally, we periodically bring in data into our data warehouse, we do it in batches.\n  - Our data warehouse should remain stable during and between these refreshes and updates.\n\n### Reasons why we build a data warehouse:\n\n- Making data-driven decisions\n  -

Data Warehousing\n  - Data Virtualization\n\n### Data Virtualization\n\n- Read-only (vs. read-write) DDBMS\n- In-place data access\n- Unlike a Data Warehouse, we do not duplicate the data, instead we access the data from it's source when we need it.\n- Many names over the years:\n  - Virtual Data Warehousing\n  - Enterprise Information Integration(EII)\n  - Enterprise Data Access (EDA)\n- Data Virtualization use cases\n  - Simple transformations\n  - Smaller number of data sources\n  -

The swapon command is better in this regard.\n\n```\nswapon --show\n```\n\n### Step 1: Make a new swap file\n\nFirst thing first, create a file with the size of swap space you want. Let’s say that I want to add 1 GB of swap space to my system. Use the fallocate command to create a file of size 1 GB.\n\n```\nsudo fallocate -l 1G /swapfile\n```\n\nIt is recommended to allow only root to read and write to the swap file. You’ll even see warning like “insecure permissions 0644, 0600 suggested” when you try to use this file for swap area.\n\n```\nsudo chmod 600 /swapfile\n```\n\nDo note that the name of the swap file could be anything. If you need multiple swap spaces, you can give it any appropriate name like swap_file_1, swap_file_2 etc. It’s just a file with a predefined size.\n\n### Step 2: Mark the new file as swap space\n\nYour need to tell the Linux system that this file will be used as swap space. You can do that with [mkswap](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/mkswap.8.html) tool.\n\n```\nsudo mkswap /swapfile\n```\n\nYou should see an output like this:\n\n```\nSetting up swapspace version 1, size = 1024 MiB (1073737728 bytes)\nno label, UUID=7e1faacb-ea93-4c49-a53d-fb40f3ce016a\n```\n\n### Step 3: Enable the swap file\n\nNow your system knows that the file swapfile can be used as swap space. But it is not done yet. You need to enable the swap file so that your system can start using this file as swap.\n\n```\nsudo swapon /swapfile\n```\n\nNow if you check the swap space, you should see that your Linux system recognizes and uses it as the swap area:\n\n```\nswapon --show\nNAME       TYPE   SIZE USED PRIO\n/swapfile  file 1024M   0B   -2\n```\n\n### Step 4: Make the changes permanent\n\nWhatever you have done so far is temporary. Reboot your system and all the changes will disappear.\n\nYou can make the changes permanent by adding the newly created swap file to /etc/fstab file.\n\nIt’s always a good idea to make a backup before you make any changes to the /etc/fstab file.\n\n```\nsudo cp /etc/fstab /etc/fstab.back\n```\n\nNow you can add the following line to the end of /etc/fstab file:\n\n```\n/swapfile none swap sw 0 0\n```\n\nYou can do it manually using a [command line text editor](https://itsfoss.com/command-line-text-editors-linux/) or you just use the following command:\n\n```\necho '/swapfile none swap sw 0 0' | sudo tee -a /etc/fstab\n```\n\nNow you have everything in place.

It is a portable artifact that can be easily shared and moved around. [[devlog.docker]], [[devlog.containerd]], [[devlog.cri-o]] are some examples of container technologies. Containers have existed before Docker.\n\nContainerized applications are applications that run in isolated runtime environments called containers. Containers encapsulate an application with all its dependencies, including system libraries, binaries, and configuration files.\n\nAn application packaged together with its dependencies that runs on top of an OS in an isolated instance and uses the kernel from the host OS.\n\n> Containers are often referred to as “lightweight,” meaning they share the machine’s operating system kernel and do not require the overhead of associating an operating system within each application. Containers are inherently smaller in capacity than a [[devlog.VM]] and require less start-up time, allowing far more containers to run on the same compute capacity as a single VM. This drives higher server efficiencies and, in turn, reduces server and licensing costs.\n\nPut simply, containerization allows applications to be “written once and run anywhere.” This portability is important in terms of the development process and vendor compatibility. It also offers other notable benefits, like fault isolation, ease of management and security, to name a few. — via [Containerization Explained - India | IBM](https://www.ibm.com/in-en/cloud/learn/containerization)\n\n## Where do containers live?\n\n?\nThey're stored in a container repository. Public or Private repositories. DockerHub is a public repository. You can use [[devlog.nexus]] as a private repository.\n\n## Container VS Image\n\n?\nTechnically, a container is made up of images, layers of images stacked on top of each other.\nAt the base of the image, you'd usually have a Linux as the Base Image. It could be `alpine` or any other distro of Linux, it is important for these Base Images to be small to make sure container stays small in size.\n\nThe application image is usually the top layer.\n\n- An image is a standalone, isolated, lightweight and executable package that contains\n  all the required components (code, runtime, system tools, libraries, settings, etc)\n  necessary to run an application. An image is the actual, moveable artifact.\n- The container is the runtime instance of the image. From the same image, you can launch more containers.\n  Images for many applications can be found on https://hub.docker.com\n- An image \"becomes\" a container when we actually start an image. It creates a container environment.\n\n## Containers VS VM\n\n?\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/zubayr/image/upload/v1657820046/wiki/rbvrr2wexsbxl8yuddgp.png)\n\nDocker virtualizes applications layer. Cannot run Linux based images on Windows kernel(which can be mitigated by install Docker Toolbox to abstract away the kernel layer).\n\nVM virtualizes both applications and OS kernel layer(entire OS). Can run on any host OS.\n\n## Docker Images\n\n**Docker image** is an immutable (unchangeable) file that contains the source code, libraries, dependencies, tools, and other files needed for an application to run.\n\nDue to their **read-only** quality, these images are sometimes referred to as snapshots. They represent an application and its virtual environment at a specific point in time. This consistency is one of the great features of Docker. It allows developers to test and experiment software in stable, uniform conditions.\n\nSince images are, in a way, just **templates**, you cannot start or run them. What you can do is use that template as a base to build a container. A container is, ultimately, just a running image. Once you create a container, it adds a writable layer on top of the immutable image, meaning you can now modify it.\n\nThe image-base on which you create a container exists separately and cannot be altered. When you run a containerized environment, you essentially create a **read-write copy** of that filesystem (docker image) inside the container. This adds a **container layer** which allows modifications of the entire copy of the image.\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/zubayr/image/upload/v1657821563/wiki/pshjskltg9vpslfynuvj.png)\n\nYou can create an unlimited number of Docker images from one **image base**. Each time you change the initial state of an image and save the existing state, you create a new template with an additional layer on top of it.\n\nDocker images can, therefore, consist of a **series of layers**, each differing but also originating from the previous one. Image layers represent read-only files to which a container layer is added once you use it to start up a virtual environment.\n\n## Docker Container\n\nA Docker container is a virtualized run-time environment where users can isolate applications from the underlying system. These containers are compact, portable units in which you can start up an application quickly and easily.\n\nA valuable feature is the standardization of the computing environment running inside the container. Not only does it ensure your application is working in identical circumstances, but it also simplifies sharing with other teammates.\n\nAs containers are autonomous, they provide strong isolation, ensuring they do not interrupt other running containers, as well as the server that supports them. Docker claims that these units “provide the strongest isolation capabilities in the industry”. Therefore, you won’t have to worry about keeping your machine secure while developing an application.\n\nUnlike virtual machines (VMs) where virtualization happens at the hardware level, containers virtualize at the app layer. They can utilize one machine, share its kernel, and virtualize the operating system to run isolated processes. This makes containers extremely lightweight, allowing you to retain valuable resources.\n\n![Containers and Virtual Machines Together](/assets/images/containers%20and%20vms.png)\nSource ~ [What is a Container? - Docker](https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container/)\n\n## Resources\n\n- [Docker Image VS Container: What is the difference?](https://phoenixnap.com/kb/docker-image-vs-container)\n","n":0.034}}},{"i":1127,"$":{"0":{"v":"Consul","n":1}}},{"i":1128,"$":{"0":{"v":"Console","n":1},"1":{"v":"\n- Areas: [[devlog.linux]]\n\n---\n\n> A console is generally a terminal in the physical sense that is by some definition the primary terminal directly connected to a machine.

Interdomain Routing (CIDR)\n\nCIDR is a notation for describing blocks of IP addresses and is used heavily in various networking configurations. IP addresses contain 4 octets, each consisting of 8 bits giving values between 0 and 255. The decimal value that comes after the slash is the number of bits consisting of the routing prefix. This in turn can be translated into a netmask, and also designates how many available addresses are in the block.\n\nSometimes we want to vary the length of our subnet masks and we don’t want to stick to the standard classes so we use CIDR. It helps optimize the IP space. It uses variable length subnet mask(VLSM).\n\nCIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) -- also known as supernetting -- is a method of assigning Internet Protocol (IP) addresses that improves the efficiency of address distribution and replaces the previous system based on Class A, Class B and Class C networks.\n\n## Resources\n\n- [CIDR.xyz](https://cidr.xyz/)\n- [IPv4, CIDR, and VPC Subnets Made Simple! - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z07HTSzzp3o&t=216s)\n","n":0.078}}},{"i":1154,"$":{"0":{"v":"chown","n":1},"1":{"v":"\n- Areas: [[devlog.linux]]\n\n---\n\nThe `chown` command allows you to change the user and/or group ownership of a given file, directory, or symbolic link. `chown` is root only command.\n\n- It is not possible to disown a file\n- Even the owner cannot change the ownership of the file, only root can\n- The numeric user ID can also be used instead of the username(`cat /etc/passwd`)\n\n### Examples\n\n`sudo chown userName fileName.txt`\n\n`sudo chown userName file1.txt file2.txt folder`\n\n`sudo chown +userID file.txt` to avoid mistransfer using user ID prefix the userID with a `+` plus sign\n\n`sudo chown userName:groupName file.txt` to change both owner and group, you can also use a `.` to separate user and group, `userName.groupName`\n\nTo only change the group of a file, use `chgrp` or `sudo chown :groupName file.txt`\n\nUse `-R` to recursively change ownership of files inside a dir\n\n`sudo chown -R userName:groupName folder`\n","n":0.086}}},{"i":1155,"$":{"0":{"v":"chmod","n":1},"1":{"v":"\n- Areas: [[devlog.linux]]\n\n---\n\n- `chmod` is the command used to change the permissions of a file or a directory using either the symbolic or the numeric notation ([[devlog.Octal Notation]]).\n- Only the root, or the file's owner can change the file's permissions.\n\n### Syntax:\n\n`chmod [who][OPERATION][permissions] filename`\n\n### `who`\n\n- `u` the **user** that owns the file\n- `g` the **group** that the file belongs to\n- `o` the **other** users\n- `a` for **all**\n\n### OPERATION flags\n\n- `-` a hyphen means remove the specified permissions\n- `+` the plus sign means add the specified permissions\n- `=` the equals sign means change the current permissions to the specified permissions\n\nThe permissions are specified using the letters `r`, `w` and `x`\n\n### Examples\n\n- Removing `w` permissions\n  - `chmod u-w file.txt`\n- Adding permissions\n  - `chmod u+rwx file.txt`\n- `chmod -v u-x,g+w,o-rwx file.txt`\n- `chmod ug-r,u+x,o-rwx file.txt`\n- `chmod a+r,a-wx file.txt`\n- `chmod ug=rw,o= file.txt`\n\n### Absolute changing mode\n\nSetting permission for all users, groups, others at the same time\n\n- `chmod 644 file.txt`\n- `chmod 777 file.txt`\n- `chmod 400 file.txt`\n- `-R` for recursively assigning permissions\n- `chmod -R 750 dirName.txt` (not recommended since the permissions for files have a different effect as permissions for directories) [[devlog.The Effect of Permissions on Directories]]\n\n### Inherit permissions from a file\n\n- `chmod --reference=refFile.txt file.txt`\n","n":0.072}}},{"i":1156,"$":{"0":{"v":"chgrp","n":1},"1":{"v":"\n- Areas: [[devlog.linux]]\n\n---\n\n`chgrp` command in Linux is used to change the group ownership of a file or directory.

We’ll build this code depending on the language they’re using; we’ll compile or transpile the code to generate an executable or simply a docker image.\n\nBuild automation is one of the processes in a [[devlog.CI⁄CD pipeline]]\n\nThere are many tools that can help us with build automation such as: [[devlog.jenkins]]\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/zubayr/image/upload/v1654367652/wiki/kvbyhogruh45cxytkvrx.png)\n\nAn example pipeline would look something like:\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/zubayr/image/upload/v1654707436/wiki/yu0yqhx2kwkjwdbg7ieg.png)\n\n## What do build and package manager tools do?\n\nThey help with:\n\n- Compiling\n- Compressing\n- Transforming code from hundreds to a single file\n- Keep artifact in storage, in an artifact repository([[devlog.nexus]]).\n- To deploy it multiple times(on different environments), make backups etc.\n\n---\n\n## Artifacts\n\n- Artifacts are apps built into a single, shareable, portable file.\n- Building Java applications produce a special artifact file such as a `.jar` or a `.war`.\n- Apps built from other programming languages may result in different artifact files such as a zip or a tarball.\n\nSee also: [[devlog.Artifact Repository]]\n\n## Building Java Applications\n\n- Install IntelliJ IDEA.\n- Install Java(or use IDEA to Download SDK).\n- Setup JDK, SDK (make sure Java executable is added to [[$PATH|devlog.path]] or `%PATH%`, respectively.)\n- Set `JAVA_HOME` as an [[environment variable|devlog.environment variable]] (Maven prerequisite).\n- Use SCM to clone(`git clone`) your Java application's repository.\n\n- Build a [[devlog.maven]] project.\n\n  - Open source code of your Java application in IntelliJ IDEA.\n  - Wait for IDEA to index the source code.\n  - IDEA will automatically detect the `pom.xml` and resolve all the dependencies.\n  - Run the application(preview in the \"Run\" tab).\n  - Download [Maven](https://maven.apache.org) and add it's `/bin`'s path to `$PATH` or `%PATH%`.\n  - Use `mvn` commands and profit!\n  - After building, `.jar` or `.war` files can be found in the `./target` folder.\n\n- Build a [[devlog.gradle]] project.\n\n  - Open source code of your Java application in IntelliJ IDEA\n  - If it has a gradle wrapper(folder) inside the repo, you don't need to install gradle\n  - Make sure the JVM configured is compatible with gradle wrapper's version.(`JAVA_HOME`)\n  - Run the application to check if everything is working fine\n  - Build with `./gradlew build`\n  - After building, `.jar` or `.war` files can be found in the `./build` folder.\n\nTo run a `.jar`: `java -jar name-of-the-app-SNAPSHOT.jar`\n\n## Managing Java dependencies\n\n- Build tools(Maven, Gradle, NPM) are required even for local development of the application.\n- Dependencies file is what keeps track of all the dependencies used in the application. Refer to `pom.xml` for a Maven project and `build.gradle` for a Gradle project.\n- All the dependencies for both kind of projects are fetched from [mvnrepository.com](https://mvnrepository.com), they're downloaded locally from the remote repository.\n\n## Building [[devlog.javascript]] / [[devlog.nodejs]] project.\n\n- Install Node.js, run `npm` to check if everything is working correctly.\n- Alternatively to `npm` you can also use `yarn` to manage dependencies and to run build commands.\n- Use the build commands from `package.json` to build it.\n- Unlike Java applications, after building a JavaScript will result in `.zip` or `.tgz` file.\n- Both `npm` and `yarn` are **package managers not build tools**, they're used for managing dependencies not for transpiling JS code.\n- Use `npm pack` to pack.\n- The resulting zip or tar doesn't contain dependencies; only the application code.\n- To run the application, you first need to install the dependencies.\n- Unpack the zip/tar.\n- Run the app.\n\n- Package frontend JS code.\n  - Separate `package.json` for frontend and backend.\n  - or have a common `package.json` for both frontend and backend.\n  - React code needs to be transpiled since it uses `jsx` syntax.\n  - Compress and minify.\n- Build tools in the JavaScript world as also known as Bundlers.\n- Most popular bundler is [[devlog.webpack]]\n- Webpack will transpile, minify, bundles, compresses(removes whitespaces etc).\n\n## Publishing build artifacts\n\n- All build tools have commands for publishing the artifacts to artifact repositories.\n- When you need the artifact, it can be [[devlog.curl]]ed or [[devlog.wget]]ed when needed.\n\n## Enter [[devlog.Docker]]\n\n- With Docker in the picture, we don't really need multiple artifact repositories. We simply need a docker image repo.\n- Furthermore, we don't need to build and move different artifact types.\n- We also don't need to install dependencies on the server, we can simply execute commands inside the docker image.\n- You still need to build the apps and then create the docker images.\n- A single `dockerfile` can be used to make all the above steps seamless.\n\n**All of this is still part of the larger [[CI/CD Pipeline|devlog.CI⁄CD pipeline]]**\n\nSee also: [[devlog.nexus]]\n","n":0.037}}},{"i":1168,"$":{"0":{"v":"Buffering","n":1},"1":{"v":"\n- Areas: [[areas.networking]]\n\n---\n\n- Devices, such as [[devlog.router]]s, allocate memory to store segments if bandwidth isn't readily available.\n- When available, it transmits the connects to the buffer.\n- If the buffer overflows, segments will be dropped.\n","n":0.171}}},{"i":1169,"$":{"0":{"v":"Bridge","n":1},"1":{"v":"\n- Bridges analyze _source_ [[devlog.MAC]] addresses in frames entering the bridge and populate an internal MAC address table\n- Making intelligent forwarding decisions based on _destination_ MAC address in the frames\n- It is utilized to deal with [[Collision Domains on Hub]]\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zubayrrr/twiki/main/bin/image.xrrpxvie95.png)\n\n### Bridge Icon\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zubayrrr/twiki/main/bin/image.x6amy3rq6kf.png)\n","n":0.154}}},{"i":1170,"$":{"0":{"v":"Boto","n":1},"1":{"v":"\n- Areas: [[devlog.aws]], [[devlog.python]]\n\n---\n\nBoto3 is the name of the Python SDK for AWS.

(**response**) (**response datatype**)\n\n**`client` VS `resource`**\n\n- Client is more low-level API.\n- Client provides one-to-one mapping to the underlying HTTP API operations.\n\n- Resource provides resource objects to access attributes and perform actions.\n- Resource is like a wrapper around Client that makes it a higher-level API and object-oriented.\n- Resource returns a `Resource Object`, we can use for subsequent calls.\n\n**Terraform VS Python**\n\n- [[devlog.terraform]] manages state of the infrastructure. It creates and configures.\n- Since Terraform knows the current state, it also knows the different between current state and desired state. It takes care of all the decision/steps to be made.\n- Terraform is idempotent(no surprises).\n- If you delete the code block of a resource declaration and do `terraform apply` it'll delete the resource as it knows that you no longer want those resource based on your TF configuration file.\n\n- Python is not idempotent, it'll create infrastructure every time you run the script. You're not \"declaring\" how many \"resources\" you want in your infra. Basically, it doesn't have state.\n- You need to explicitly delete your resources. Not easy because of specific policies(like of a VPC). Requires a lot of code to make it happen.\n\n**Use cases of Boto**\n\n- More complex logic, since Python is a full fledged programming language allowing you to use conditional statements etc.\n- Boto allows far more things than Terraform offers because of it's low-level API.\n- Boto is an AWS library - it offers far more information than Terraform. Allowing you to do things like backups, monitoring, scheduled tasks etc.\n- You can use other libraries in your program to extend functionality.\n- You can even add a web interface to your program. A UI.\n\n## Labs\n\n- [[devlog.ec2 server status check]]\n- [[devlog.add env tags to  ec2 servers]]\n- [[devlog.EKS cluster information]]\n- [[devlog.Automate Data Backup of EC2 instances]]\n- [[devlog.Automate cleanup of old Snapshots]]\n- [[devlog.Restore volume from a snapshot of EC2 instance]]\n\n## Resources\n\n- [Boto3 documentation](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/index.html)\n","n":0.047}}},{"i":1171,"$":{"0":{"v":"Bit","n":1},"1":{"v":"\n- Areas: [[areas.Computer Science]]\n\n---\n","n":0.5}}},{"i":1172,"$":{"0":{"v":"BIOS","n":1},"1":{"v":"\nNewer version of BIOS is [[devlog.uefi]]\n\nBIOS is the firmware on the [[devlog.Motherboard]], firmware instruction set of a motherboard, it can be upgraded, it is burned into the chip of the motherboard.\n\nWe can configure things such as:\n\n- Power on password\n- Driver encryption\n- Secure boot(that makes sure OS hasn't been tampered with) Secure boot is specific to [[devlog.uefi]]\n","n":0.134}}},{"i":1173,"$":{"0":{"v":"Biology","n":1}}},{"i":1174,"$":{"0":{"v":"Big Data","n":0.707},"1":{"v":"\n- Areas: [[devlog.Data Engineering]]\n\n---\n\nBig Data is a term for collections of data sets so large and complex that it becomes difficult to process them using in-hand database management tools or traditional data processing applications.\n\n### 5 Vs of Big Data\n\n- Volume - Storing and processing huge data sets\n- Variety - Storing and processing different types of data\n- Velocity - The speed at which data is being generated\n- Value - Finding meaning out of data, making sense of data\n- Veracity - Uncertainty and inconsistencies in the data\n\n### Use cases:\n\n- Web and E-tailing\n  - Recommendation Engines\n  - Ad Targeting\n  - Search Quality\n- Telecommunications\n  - Abuse and Click Fraud Detection\n  - Customer Churn Prevention\n  - Network Performance Optimization\n  - Calling Data Record(CDR) Analysis\n  - Analyzing Network to Predict Failure\n- Banks and Financial Services\n  - Modeling True Risk\n  - Threat Analysis\n  - Fraud Detection\n  - Trade Surveillance\n  - Credit Scoring and Analysis\n- Retail\n  - Point of Sales Transaction Analysis\n  - Customer Churn Analysis\n  - Sentiment Analysis\n- Government\n  - Fraud Detection and Cybersecurity\n  - Welfare Schemes\n  - Justice\n- Healthcare and Life Sciences\n  - Health Information Exchange\n  - Gene Sequencing\n  - Serialization\n  - Healthcare Service Quality Improvements\n  - Drug Safety\n  - See [PoweredBy](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/HADOOP2/poweredby) for companies that are these technologies for Big Data\n- Semi-structured data\n- Unstructured data\n- Structured data\n- Large amount of data cannot fit on a single machine that needs processing is processed using distributed machines.\n- A distributed process has access to the computational resources across a number of machines connected through a network.\n- After a certain point, it is easier to scale out to many lower [[CPU]] machines, than to try to scale up to a single machine with a high CPU.\n- Distributed machines also have the advanteage of easily scaling, you can just add more machines.\n- They also include fault tolerance, if one machines fails, the whole network can still go on.\n\n### [[devlog.hadoop]]\n\n- Hadoop is a way to distribute very large files across multiple machines.\n- It uses the Hadoop Distributed File System [[devlog.hdfs]]\n- HDFS allows a user to work with large data sets\n- HDFS also duplicates blocks of data for fault tolerance\n- It also then uses [[devlog.mapreduce]]\n- MapReduce allows computations on that data\n- You've a NameNode(Master) and that connects to multiple DataNode(s)(Slave)\n\nHadoop really only comes with HDFS and MapReduce and all the other technologies are addons, developed separately by different individuals.\n\nJava is highly preferable for MR\n\n- Pig was invented by Yahoo, PigLatin is the language, it a scripting language that was brought about to replace SQL/Java in MR. Internally it runs on MR and converts the code to Java. Most stuff that can be done on Hive can be done on Pig.\n- Sqoop was invented by a group, to bring data from RDBMS to Hadoop you write code in MapReduce, to avoid this, they brought about sqoop, sqoop doesn't use a programming language but commands to bring in data to Hadoop. sqoop also allows you to send data back to RDBMS from Hadoop. Import and Export. Used for Datapipeline, sqoop internally runs on Java.\n- Oozie was invented by Yahoo, its like an XML file, its a scheduler, used for automating, scheduling jobs, like running queries on a specific time. Big Data tech stack may include non Big Data specific schedulers. It runs on Java internally.\n\nAll of above technologies discussed are abstractions of MapReduce.\n\nBig Data tech stack don't only consist of Big Data tools/technologies, MySQL for example is not a Big Data specific tool/technologies.\n\n### [HBase](#HBase)\n\nStorage part, Database for Hadoop but NoSQL, invented by Facebook, HBase shell commands, works on top of Hadoop, all the modern databases are NoSQL database.\nIt is different from Hive.\n\n### Mahoot\n\nFramework for Data Science\n\n### Flume\n\nSimilar to sqoop, used in datapipelines, flume can retrieve data in realtime. Messaging queue. sqoop is only for RDBMS unlike Flume which can be used for a fetching data from many other sources.(like twitter). Flume only retrieves data to Hadoop but cannot send it back to any other targets, only incoming.\n\nThere are other MQs such as Kafka, Scribe.\n\nHadoop is a losely couple framework, you can swap out/in components like oozie and it would still work, unlike tightly coupled frameworks(like .NET frameworks)\n\nIntegrations - Hadoop can be integrated well with Spark or any other Big Data frameworks.\n\nHadoop can also be connected with non Big Data components like [[devlog.MySQL]] or other RDBMSes.\n\n### [[devlog.hdfs]]\n\n- HDFS will use blocks of data, with a size of 128 MB by default.\n- Each of these blocks is replicated 3 times.\n- The blocks are distributed in a way to support fault tolerance.\n- Smaller blocks provide more parallelization during processing.\n- Multiple copies of a block prevents loss of data due to a failure of a node.\n\n### MapReduce\n\n- MapReduce is a way of splitting a computation task to a distributed set of files (such as HDFS).\n- It consists of a Job Tracker and multiple Task Trackers.\n- The Job Tracker sends code to run on the Task Trackers.\n- The Task Trackers allocate CPU and memory for the tasks and monitor the tasks on the worker nodes.\n\n### Spark\n\n- One of the latest and open source technologies built to quickly and easily handle Big Data.\n- It is a Framework for dealing with large data, distributing it and doing calculations across distributed network. It is written in Scala. Scala gets the Spark's latest features, Scala is written in Java so Java can also be used for Spark's lastest features.\n- Created at AMPLab at UC Berkeley, first released in Feb of 2013.\n- It is a flexible alternative to MapReduce. (doesn't necessarily replaces Hadoop but MapReduce)\n- Spark can use data stored in a variety of formats\n  - Cassandra\n  - AWS S3\n  - [[devlog.hdfs]] and more\n\n### [[devlog.apache spark]] VS [[devlog.mapreduce]]\n\n- MapReduce requires files to be stored in HDFS, Spark does not\\!\n- Spark also can perform operations up to 100x faster than MapReduce.\n- It is not really Hadoop VS MapReduce, people sometime make it as such because MapReduce uses HDFS.\n- MapReduce writes most data to disk after each Map and Reduce operation.\n- Spark keeps most of the data in memory something like RAM after each Transformation. Spark can spill over to [[HDD]] if you don't have enough [[RAM]].\n\n### Spark RDDs\n\n- At the core of Spark is the idea of a Resilient Distributed Dataset(RDD).\n- Resilient Distributed Dataset (RDD) has 4 main features:\n  - Distrbuted Collections of Data\n  - Fault-tolerant\n  - Parallel operation - ability to be partitioned\n  - Ability to use many data sources\n\nAt the abstract level it looks like:\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zubayrrr/twiki/main/bin/image.ewfeqm3kqzs.png)\n\nAt physical level:\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zubayrrr/twiki/main/bin/image.3f0c49iwkep.png)\n\n- [[devlog.rdd]]s are immutable, lazily evaluated and cacheable\n- There are two types of Spark operations:\n  - Transformations\n  - Actions\n- Transformations are basically a recipe to follow.\n- Actions actually perform what the recipe says to do and returns something back.\n- This behavior carries over to the syntax when coding.\n- A lot of times you will write a method call off of a [[DataFrame]] you won't see anything as a result until you call the action.\n- This makes sense because with a large dataset, you don't want to calculate all the transformations until you are sure you want to perform them\\!\n- When discussing Spark syntax you'll often see RDD versus DataFrame syntax show up.\n- With the release of Spark 2.0, Spark is moving towards a DataFrame based syntax, but keep in mind that the way files are being distributed can still be thought of as RDDs(it is still happening in RDD at the pyhsical level), it is just the typed out syntax that is changing.\n\n### Spark [[DataFrame]]s\n\n- Spark DataFrames are also now the standard way of using Spark's Machine Learning capabilities.\n- Spark DataFrame documentation is still pretty new and can be sparse, it can be found on [spark.apache.org](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/)\n\n### Python and Spark\n\n- Realistically Spark won't be running on a single machine, it will run on a cluster on a service, like [[AWS]].\n- These cluster services will pretty much always be a [[devlog.linux]]) based system.\n\n---\n\n## Miscellaneous Notes\n\n### Scalable Cluster Computing\n\nScalable Cluster Computing is a method of combining discrete computing resources(e.g servers) to increase the performance of a single application.\n\nDoes not work for applications\\! (i.e., not all applications \"scale\")\n\n### Of Servers, Nodes and Daemons\n\n#### Server/Node\n\nA Cluster is a collection of servers working together on one problem.\n\n- Servers come with cores, memory, storage and network\n- Servers can be called a \"**NODE**\" in a cluster of servers\n\n#### Daemon\n\nA daemon is a program that is constantly running and responding to requests (e.g., web server)\n\n- Servers can have one or multiple daemons running on them\n- Daemons can communicate with other daemons and form a network within and between servers\n- Each daemon can also be called a \"**NODE**\"\n\n### Scalable Behaviour\n\nof Scalable Systems:\nThe ability to apply resources (servers, VM instances) to a problem as a means to increase performance(green line) over a single server(red line).\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zubayrrr/twiki/main/bin/image.t6kfn1dy0om.png)\n\nBut, initially performance may lag due to overhead(the setup of our infrastructure).\n","n":0.026}}},{"i":1175,"$":{"0":{"v":"bg","n":1},"1":{"v":"\n- Areas: [[devlog.linux]]\n\n---\n\n`bg` is a job control command.

First released in 1989, it has been used as the default login shell for most Linux distributions. Bash was one of the first programs [[resources.people.Linus Torvalds]] ported to Linux, alongside GCC.\n\n## Bash Aliases\n\n![[devlog.aliases]]\n\n---\n\n## Introduction\n\n- To check what shell was started use `echo $0`\n- List all installed shells `cat /etc/shells`\n- Check each user's default shell `cat /etc/passwd` last column\n\nA shell script is an executable text file that contains commands, variables, functions, loops and so on that are executed sequentially.\n\nIt is widely used for automating repetitive tasks, customize administrative tasks, create your own powertools or small applications. Other examples of scripting can be found in: monitoring the system, data backup/restore, email based alert system, security auditing.\n\n## The Shebang\n\nThe Shebang is made of `#!` is followed by the path of the interpreter.\n\n`#!/bin/bash`\n\nFor executable scripts the system expects The Shebang in the first line of the script that indicates which program to run as the interpreter with the script file as the argument.\nBasically, to indicate what program will run the file whether bash, python, php or other interpreters.\n\nIf you execute a script without the shebang the interpreter will use the default shell.\n\nRun `which bash` `which -a bash` to find the location of the interpreter.\n\nWhen using Python as the interpreter for a script\n\n`#!/usr/bin/python3` will be the first line of the script(with the python code)\n\n## Comments\n\nBash will ignore everything written after the `#` symbol. The only exception being The Shebang\nBash doesn't support multi line commenting. See [[devlog.here document]]\n\n## Running Bash Scripts\n\n- Make it executable\n  - `chmod +x script.sh`\n- Run it with its relative path using `./script.sh`\n- Or run it with its absolute path\n\n  - The script will run in a sub shell\n\n- You can also pass the name of the interpreter before the script(this will make the script work even if you don't explicity give it execution permission) such as:\n\n  - `bash script.sh`\n  - `python3 script.py`\n\n- `source script.sh` or `. script.sh`\n  - Will make the script run in the current shell.\n\n## Variables\n\nVariable is a name of a memory location where a value which can be manipulated is stored.\n\n- `foo=bar` space before and after `=` assignment operator is not allowed.\n- If the value of the variable is a string that contains spaces, enclose it with `\" \"` double quotes.\n- Bash is a weakly typed langauge and doesn't require you to define any data type at variable declaration.\n- There are no floating point numbers in bash. Only integers.\n- Variable names cannot start with a number nor can they have special characters in them.\n- It can contain an underscore or different case.\n- Giving a value to a variable is called assigning variable a value.\n- Retrieving a value stored in a variable is called referencing.\n- Preceed a variable with `$` to access it's value.\n- Variable name is not referenced if single quotes are used (such as in an echo statement).\n- Use backslash to escape a reserved character's role such as `\\$PATH`.\n- A variable can reference value from an existing variable `newVar=\"$oldVar\"`\n\nUse `set` command to retrieve value to get all shell variables and functions.\n\n![[devlog.environment variable]]\n\n![[devlog.shell variables]]\n\n## Constants\n\nDeclare constants(variables whose values doesn't change) using `declare -r constName=\"constVal\"`\n\nYou cannnot `unset` or delete a read-only variable.\n\n## Create Your First Bash Script\n\n1. `vim first_script.sh`\n   - some people consider giving extensions to an executable as a bad practice.\n2. complete the script\n\n```bash\nmkdir -p new_dir\necho \"yay! first script\" > new_dir/file.txt\nls -l new_dir\ncat new_dir/file.txt\n```\n\n3. Save and exit\n4. Give permissions for execution\n\n`chmod 700 first_script.sh`\n\n5. Execute it using relative path\n\n`./first_script.sh`\n\nIf you don't use relative path, shell will throw an error because it would be looking for commands and scripts from the [[$PATH|devlog.path]] variable.\n\n## User Input\n\n- `read` is responsible for collecting user input - it'll stop a program until the user has given an input and has returned the input with the RETURN or ENTER Key\n\n- Create a new variable with some prompt\n\n`read -p \"some prompt for user: \" $varName`\n\n- Create a new variable that doesn't display the input (like entering password)\n\n`read -s -p \"safely enter value: \" $varName`\n\n## Special Variables and Positional Arguments\n\nLets take the following command for example\n\n`./script filename1 dir1 10.0.0.1`\n\nThere are predefined variables available such:\n\n`$0` is the name of the script itself (`./script.sh`)\n`$1` is the first positional argument (`filename`)\n`$2` is the second positional argument (`dir1`)\n`$3` is the third positional argument (`10.0.0.1`)\n`$9` would be the ninth and after it arguments must be enclosed in `{}` curly braces such as `${10}` for the tenth\n\n`$#` is the number of the positional arguments\n`\"$*\"` is the string representation of all positional arguments: `$1` `$2` `$3` ...\n`$?` is the most recent foreground command exit status\n\n## If, Elif and Else Statements\n\n```bash\nif [some condition is true]\nthen\n    // execute this code\nelif [some other condition is true]\nthen\n    // execute this code\nelse\n    // execute this code\nfi\n```\n\n## `[]` vs `[[]]`\n\n`[]` is the old way used for testing conditions.\n\n`[[]]` is the new way of testing conditions and is considered to be safer. Double square brackets prevent word splitting or string variables that contain spaces, you don't need to double qoute string variables even though its a good practice. It also have features like [[devlog.regular expression]] matching.\n\n## Testing Conditions For Numbers\n\nRun `man test` to list all available testing (comparison operators for integer comparison)\n\n## Multiple Conditions and Nested If Statements\n\nUsing local operators allow you to use multiple conditions in the if statement.\n\n`&&` is the AND operator\n`||` is the OR operator\n\n## Command Subsitution\n\nIn the following example, the `date` command was executed and the output is stored inside the variable `now`.\n\n```bash\nnow=`date`\n```\n\nIf the output is going to be a string, it is recommended to enclose it inside double quotes.\n\n```bash\nnow=\"`date`\"\n```\n\nThe other way of doing command subsitution is:\n\n```bash\nuser=`$(who)`\n\n# this is same as:\n\nuser=\"`who`\"\n```\n\nYou can substitute the entire command line, which can be multiple commands piped together.\n\n`ps -ef | grep bash`\n\n`output=\"$(ps -ef | grep bash)\"`\n\n## Comparing Strings in If Statements\n\nTwo strings are equal if their length is same and contains the same sequence of characters in the same order.\n\n- The comparsion operator is a single `=` sign when using if statement with `[]` single square brackets and its `==` when using double square brackets `[[]]`\n\n- The inequality operator is `!=`\n\nOne of the approach to check for substring inside a string is to surround the substring with asterisk `*` to make it match all the characters.\n\n```bash\nstr1=\"Linux is amazing\"\nif [[ \"str1\" == *\"Linux\"*]]\n```\n\n- `-n` returns true if the string length is NON zero and `-z` returns true if the string length is zero.\n\n## For Loop\n\n```bash\nfor item in LIST\ndo\n  commands\ndone\n```\n\n### Examples\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\n\nfor os in Ubuntu CentOS \"MX Linux\" Kali Manjaro\ndo\n  echo \"os is $os\"\ndone\n```\n\n---\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\nfor num in {3..7}\ndo\n  echo \"num is $num\"\ndone\n```\n\n---\n\nDefining increment for a range\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\n\nfor num in {10..100..5}\ndo\n  echo \"num is $num\"\ndone\n```\n\n---\n\nGoing through the current directory, displaying the contents of the files\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\n\nfor item in ./*\ndo\n  if [[ -f \"$item\" ]]\n  then\n      echo \"Displaying the contents of $item\"\n      sleep 1\n      cat $item\n      echo \"##########\"\n  fi\ndone\n```\n\n---\n\nRename all files in the current directory ending in `.txt` extension by adding a string at the start of the file name\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\n\nfor file in *.txt\ndo\n  mv \"$file\" \"renamed_$file\"\ndone\n```\n\n### For Loops Like In Programming Langauges\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\n\nfor ((i=0;i<=50;i++))\ndo\n  echo \"i = $i\"\ndone\n```\n\n## While Loops\n\nIt is used to execute a set of commands as long as the given condition evaluates to true.\n\n```bash\nwhile CONDITION\ndo\n  COMMANDS\ndone\n```\n\nUse `:` to always return true\n\n```bash\nwhile :\ndo\n  output=\"$(pgrep -l $1)\"\n  if [[ -n \"$output\" ]]\n  then\n      echo \"The process  \\\"$1\"\\ is running.\n  else\n      echo \"The process  \\\"$1\"\\ is NOT running.\n  fi\n  sleep 3\ndone\n```\n\n### Examples\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\n\ni=0\n\nwhile [[ $i -lt 10]]\ndo\n  echo \"i: $i\"\n  ((i++)) # let i = i++\ndone\n```\n\n## Case Statements\n\nThe case construct allows us to test string and numbers and is infact a simpler form of bash if, elif, else statement.\n\nCase is similar to Switch statements in other programming languages.\n\nIt is not a loop, it doesn't execute a block of code `n` number of times. Instead, bash shell checks the conditions and controls the flow of the program.\n\n```bash\ncase EXPRESSION in\n  PATTERN_1)\n    STATEMENTS\n    ;;\n  PATTERN_2)\n   STATEMENTS\n    ;;\n  PATTERN_3)\n    STATEMENTS\n    ;;\n  PATTERN_N)\n    STATEMENTS\n    ;;\n    *)\n    STATEMENTS\n    ;;\nesac\n```\n\n### Examples\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\n\necho -n \"Enter your favourite pet: \"\nread PET\n\ncase \"$PET\" in\n    dog)\n        echo \"Your favourite pet is dog\"\n        ;;\n    cat||CAT)\n        echo \"You like cats\"\n        ;;\n    fist||\"African turtle\")\n        echo \"Fish or turtles are great\"\n        ;;\n    *)\n        echo \"Your favourite pet is unknown\"\nesac\n```\n\n---\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\n\nif [[ $# -ne 2 ]]\nthen\n    echo \"Run the script with 2 arguments: Signal and PID\"\n    exit\nfi\ncase \"$1\" in\n      1)\n        echo \"Sending the SIGHUP signal to $2\"\n        kill -SIGHUP $2\n        ;;\n      2)\n        echo \"Sending the SIGINT signal to $2\"\n        kill -SIGINT $2\n        ;;\n      15)\n        echo \"Sending the SIGTERM signal to $2\"\n        kill -15 $2\n        ;;\n      *)\n        echo \"Signal number $1 will not be delivered\"\n        ;;\nesac\n```\n\n## Functions\n\nThere are two different formats for declaring a function.\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\n\nfunction print_something () {\n  echo \"I am a function\"\n}\n```\n\n```bash\ndisplay_something () {\n  echo \"Hello world!\"\n}\n```\n\nTo call a function just write it's name without any paranethesis `display_something`\n\n### Arguments\n\nIn bash you cannot pass arguments through the paranthesis, they're only for decoration.\nTo pass any information to the function use arguments like they're passed to a command.\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\n\ncreate_files () {\n  echo \"Creating $1\"\n  touch $1\n  chmod 400 $1\n  echo \"Creating $2\"\n  touch $2\n  chmod 600 $2\n}\n\ncreate_files file1.txt file2.txt\n```\n\n### Returns\n\nBash doesn't allow you to return a value of a function, doing so using the return keyword, we're setting the status of the command executed or of the function. $? contains the status of previously run command or function.\n\nTypically, a value of `0` means everything went successfully and a non zero value means something did not went succesfully.\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\n\ncreate_files () {\n  echo \"Creating $1\"\n  touch $1\n  chmod 400 $1\n  return 10\n}\n\ncreate_files file1.txt\n```\n\nTo get a real \"return\" value like in other programming languages, you can try command substitution.\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\n\nfunction lines_in_file () {\n  grep -c \"$1\" \"$2\"\n}\n\nn=$(lines_in_file \"usb\" \"/var/log/dmesg\")\necho $n\n```\n\n## Variable Scope in Functions\n\nScope refers to which part of a script the variable is \"visible\". In bash, all variables by default are global; they're visible everywhere inside a script.\n\nIf you want to define a local variable within the function body, use the `local` keyword before declaring variable.\nIt is considered a good practice to use local variables in order to contain everything inside a function.\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\n\nvar1=\"AA\"\nvar2=\"BB\"\n\nfunction func1 () {\n  var1=\"XX\"\n  local var2=\"YY\"\n  echo \"Inside func1: var1=$var1 and var2=v$var2\"\n}\nfunc1\necho \"After calling func1: var1=$var1 and var2=v$var2\"\n```\n\n## Select\n\n```bash\nselect ITEM in LIST\ndo\n  commands\ndone\n```\n\n- ITEM is a user defined variable and the LIST is a series of strings, numbers or output of commands.\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\n\nselect COUNTRY in Germany India \"United Kingdom\"\ndo\n  echo \"Country is $COUNTRY\"\n  echo \"Your choice is $REPLY\"\ndone\n```\n\nUse `PS3` to define a prompt\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\n\nPS3=\"Choose your country: \"\nselect COUNTRY in Germany India \"United Kingdom\"\ndo\n  echo \"Country is $COUNTRY\"\n  echo \"Your choice is $REPLY\"\ndone\n```\n\n- You can use `select` with `case` and `if` statements\n\n## Examples\n\n- [[devlog.connection testing]]\n- [[devlog.Dropping a List of IP addresses Using a For Loop]]\n- [[devlog.System Administration Script using Menus]]\n\n## Resources\n\n- [Developing Console Applications with Bash | Linux Journal](https://www.linuxjournal.com/content/developing-console-applications-bash)\n","n":0.024}}},{"i":1179,"$":{"0":{"v":"Barcode","n":1},"1":{"v":"\nBarcodes are a series of bars that have different width, they're used for scanning codes from merchandise, tickets.\n","n":0.236}}},{"i":1180,"$":{"0":{"v":"background process","n":0.707},"1":{"v":"\n- Areas: [[devlog.linux]]\n\n---\n\nBackground processes are non interactive and are started by the system services or by the users.

Since it is written in Java, it takes more time to execute.\n- hadoop supports [[Kerberos]] authentication, which is difficult to manage.\n\nSpark\n\n- Spark processes data 100 times faster than MapReduce as it is done in-memory (like [[Tez]]).\n- Performs both batch processing and real-time processing of data, most use cases are around real-time processing.\n- Spark hs fewer lines of code as it is implemented in [[devlog.scala]].\n- Spark supports authentication via a shared secret. It can also run on [[devlog.yarn]] leveraging the capability of [[Kerberos]].\n\n### Spark Features\n\nFast processing\n\n- Spark contains [[devlog.rdd]]s which saves time taken in reading and writing operations and hence, it runs almost ten to hundred times faster than hadoop.\n- In-memory computing - In Spark data is stored in the RAM, so it can access the data quickly and accelerate the speed of analytics.\n  - Caching is different from In-memory computing, caching is mainly to support \"read ahead\" mechanism, where you have your data preloaded so that it can benefit further queries.\n  - In-memory computing is more about lazy evaluation, data being loaded in memory only and only if a specific action is invoked.\n- Flexible - polyglot\n- Fault tolerance - Spark contains [[devlog.rdd]]s (execution logic, temporary datasets which initially do not have any data loaded and data will only be loaded into RDDs when an execution is made) that are designed to handle the failure of any worker node in the cluster. Thus, it ensures that the loss of data reduces to zero.\n  - Distributed\n- Better analytics - Spark has a rich set of SQL queries, machine learning algorithms, complex analytics etc.\n\n### Spark Misconceptions\n\nSpark is not concerned with data sources\n\nSpark is not part of [[devlog.hadoop]], it interacts with Hadoop and HDFS well but it is it's own thing.\n\n## Components of Apache Spark\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zubayrrr/twiki/main/bin/image.cct1xwxfey9.png)\n\n[[Spark Core]]\n\n- Contains [[devlog.rdd]]s; core engine that takes care of processing\n\nSee also: [[DAG]]\n\n[[Spark SQL]]\n\n- For working with structured data or data that can be structurized.\n- Has internal features such as Dataframes, datasets used to process structued data in much faster way.\n\n[[Spark Streaming]]\n\n- Allows you to create Spark Streaming applications which not only works on data that is being streamed/generated in but also transform the data and analyze it as it comes in.\n\n[[Spark MLlib]]\n\n- For building machine learning algorithms, predictive analytics, perscriptive, descriptive, preemptive, recommendation systems.\n\n[[GraphX]]\n\n- Data naturally has a network kind of flow, data that be represented with graphs(not really pie charts) but network related data, some kind of relationships, twitter, fb, linkedin etc.\n\n## Spark Architecture\n\nApache Spark uses a master-slave(technically, although it can also run in standalone mode) architecture that consists of a driver, that runs on a master node and multiple executors which run across the worker nodes in the cluster.\n\nIt can work with different clustering technologies such as Apache Mesos, [[devlog.yarn]]. It can also work as standalone.\n\nMaster Node has a driver program; this driver program internally has SparkContext.\n\nThe Spark code behaves as a driver program and creates a SparkContext, which is gateway to all the Spark functionalities.\n\nDriver program interacts with cluster manager(SparkContext, the entry point, takes the request to the cluster manager).\n\nCluster manager in terms of YARN is the `ResourceManager`\n\nSpark application runs as independent set of processes on a cluster.\n\nThe driver program and SparkContext takes care of the job execution within the cluster.\n\nA job is split into multiple tasks that are distributed over the worker node.\n\nWhen an [[devlog.rdd]] is created in SparkContext, it can be distributed across various nodes.\n\nWorker nodes are slaves that run different tasks.\n\n---\n\nSpark Architecture is based on 2 important abstractions:\n\n### [[devlog.rdd]]\n\nResilient Distributed Datasets\n\nSpark Core is embedded with RDDs, an immutable fault-tolerant(like files in [[devlog.hdfs]]), distributed collection of objects that can be operated on in parallel.\n\nIt where the data will be loaded(or existing for processing), it can exist for shorter amount of time.\n\n- RDDs are the fundamental units of data in Apache Spark that are split into partitions and can be executed on different nodes of a cluster. Implicit, lazy in nature, created whenever you use a method of SparkContext or when you do a transformation on an existing RDD or a dataset.\n- Each dataset in an RDD is divided into logical memory partitions that may be computed on different nodes of a cluster.\n- By default every RDD has 2 partitions, which can be customized while creating RDDs.\n- The more partitions you've the better the parallel processing.\n- RDDs are automatically split into partitions and can be executed upon different nodes by different taks in parallel, in-memory.\n\nThere are mainly two operations that can be peformed on an RDD\n\n### Transformation\n\n- These are operations (such as map, filter, join, union) that are peformed on an RDD that yields as new RDD containing the result.\n- They return a pointer to a new RDD. The original RDD cannot be changed. Spark is \"lazy\" and nothing will be executed unless an action is invoked.\n- It isn't necessarily reproducing a new set of data or RDD, but is a new \"state\". Think of it as step(s) in a program telling Spark how to get new data and what to do with it.\n- **Resilience** is the ability to retrace steps from the beginning.\n\n### Actions\n\n- These are operations (reduce, first, count, collect, count, take save-as) that return a value after running a computation on an RDD.\n- They return values and force the transformations to actually take place.\n\nSee also: [[DAG]]\n\n### [[DAG]]\n\nDirected Acyclic Graph\n\nSpark has a DAG scheduler in the background which is tracking the transformations and steps which is part of your applications.\n\nIt is the scheduling layer of the Spark Architecture that implements stage-oriented scheduling and eliminates that hadoop [[devlog.mapreduce]] multistage execution model.\n\nIf you're processing data using Spark applications in a Spark platform(whether standalone or in a hadoop cluster), for every step you do as part of your application, it creates an [[devlog.rdd]], it becomes part of your DAG.

and the information about the structure of the data is applied to the DataFrame in the form of a Schema\n\nSchema = description of fields aka columns and their type\n\nSpark types, they spark at runtime rather than compile time.\n\n---\n\n### How DataFrames Work\n\nDistributed spreadsheets with rows and columns, like a table that is split between multiple nodes in a Spark cluster, the information each Spark node recieves is the schema of the DataFrame anda few of the rows that compose the DataFrame.\n\nDistributed collections of Rows conforming to a schema\n\nDataFrames are:\n\n- Immutable\n  - Can't be changed once created\n  - If you want to modify them you will have to create new DataFrames using transformations\n\nSchema = list describing the column names and types\n\n- Types are known to Spark when the DataFrame is being used, not at compile time(to make them available at compile time with Type safe Datasets)\n- Schema can hold arbitrary number of columns\n- All rows have the same structure\n- Rows do not have schema but they conform to the same structure\n\n<!-- end list -->\n\n    val carsSchema = StructType(Array(\n        StructField(\"Name\", StringType),\n        StructField(\"HorsePower\", IntegerType),\n        StructField(\"Acceleration\", DoubleType)\n    ))\n\n### Need to be distributed\n\nThese collections of rows need to be distributed, because either the data is too big for a single computer or it takes too long to process entier data on a single CPU.\n\n### Partitioning\n\n- Splits the data into files, distributed between nodes in the cluster\n- Impacts the processing parallelism\n- More partitions may mean more parallelism but if you have 1000 partitions (1000 small files that compose your DataFrame) and a single node to process them all, parallelism will still be one because you only have one node to process all that data.\n- Inversely, if you have 1 partition and many nodes in your Spark cluster, only one node will have access to that partition and the parallelism would still be one.\n\n### Transformations\n\n- Narrow = one input partition contributes to at most one output partition(e.g map), partitioning is not changed in a DataFrame.\n  - If you do a map, that would transform data row by row and so the partitioning is not changed, whereas\n- Wide = input partitions(one or more) create many output partitions, so the partitioning of the DataFrame is changed.\n  - If you do a sort, that will involve exchanging data between partitions in between nodes in the cluster.\n- These operations are known as Shuffle = data exchange between cluster nodes.\n  - Shuffling occurs in Wide transformations and its a massive performance topic, it can impact the time it takes for your jobs by orders of magnitude.\n\n### Computing DataFrames\n\nHow DataFrames work at runtime\n\nLazy evaluation\n\n- Spark mechanism to wait until the last moment to execute the DF transformations\n\nPlanning\n\n- Spark compiles the DF transformations and dependencies into a graph before running any code, Spark will know before hand every single step that it will have to take including data exchanges between nodes before it actually starts loading or running any code.\n- Logical plan = DF dependency graph + narrow/wide transformations sequence\n- Physical plan = optimized seqence of steps(and it will know which node will execute which part of transformations) for nodes in the cluster.\n- Optimizations such as: avoiding multiple passes over the data or pushing down predecates in SQL or chaining multiple predecates or where clauses into one and so on.\n\n### Transformations vs Actions\n\n- A transformation descibes how new DFs are obtained (e.g map)\n- Action actually starts executing Spark code (e.g show, count)\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zubayrrr/twiki/main/bin/image.rv3o8j0t3m.png)\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zubayrrr/twiki/main/bin/image.mymxbbtheoj.png)\n\n## Joins\n\nCombine data from multiple DataFrames\n\n- one(or more) columns from table 1 (left) is compared with one(or more) columns from table 2 (right)\n- if the condition passes, rows are combined\n- non-matching rows are distracted\n\nIn Spark, Joins are Wide transformations(read: expensive\\!)\nIn order to compute a join, Spark scans the entire DFs from the entire clusters and the data is going to be moved around in between nodes, this involves shuffling which is expensive (in terms of performance).\n","n":0.022}}},{"i":1193,"$":{"0":{"v":"Ansible","n":1},"1":{"v":"\n- Areas: [[areas.devops]]\n- Related: [[devlog.puppet]], [[devlog.chef]]\n\n---\n\n- Ansible is a configuration management system used to configure, automate,monitor, and troubleshoot devices in large networks.\n- It is written in [[devlog.python]] and is open source under GPL License.\n- There is a control node and many managed nodes (network devices we manage with Ansible). Windows OS is not supported as a control node at this moment (only [[devlog.WSL]]);\n- Ansible uses an agentless architecture. No application is installed on the managed nodes and no daemon, process or agent is running;\n- Ansible uses for device configuration. Any system that can be configured using [[devlog.SSH]] can also be configured using Ansible;\n- When managing Windows it users native PowerShell remote support instead of SSH;\n- It is also known as an orchestration engine, used in large networks with many devices that need to be configured, maintained and troubleshooted in an automated way.\n- Ansible uses Modules which are scripts or units of work that do the actual job.\n- Theres no process that runs continuously on neither the controlling machine or the managed machine(s)\n- The controlling node doesn't have be a privileged user, it can simply ssh into the managed node.\n\n## Ansible Components\n\n- Inventory is a list of managed nodes. An inventory file is also sometimes called a \"host file\". The inventory can specify information such as IP address, hostname or domain-name for each managed node. Default location: `/etc/ansible/hosts` (or use the `-i` flag to use a custom file). An inventory file can be formatted as an INI or YAML file.\n- Modules are the units of code ansible executes. Each module has a particular use, from administering users on a specific type of database to managing VLAN interfaces on a specific type of network device or to installing, configuring and starting a specific server like for example Apache2 on a Linux distribution.\n- Tasks are units of action in Ansible. You can execute a single task once with an Ad-Hoc command or multiple tasks in a playbook.\n- Playbooks are ordered lists of tasks. We can run those tasks in that order repeatedly.\n- Playbooks are written in YAML and are easy to read, write, share and understand.\n\n## Inventory File\n\nWithin the inventory file, we can organize our server into different groups, this will help us keep the host in order and permit us to use group variables. A host can be part of multiple groups.\n\n```ini\n[servers]\n\nvps1 ansible_host=207.154.254.221\nvps2 ansible_host=167.122.186.63\nvps3 ansible_host=139.59.155.232\n```\n\n- `ansible_host` is a predefined variable that holds the value of the managed hosts.\n- To parse the inventory file and list all the hosts defined in the inventory file:\n  - `ansible -i ./hosts --list-hosts all`\n- To check if ansible is able to communicate with the hosts\n  - `ansible -i ./hosts vps1 -m ping -u userName -k` (to test for the whole group, use the group name such as: `servers` instead of `vps1`)\n  - `-m` is for \"module\" in this case we're using the `ping` module - it checks the ssh authentication for the each node.\n  - `-u` defines the username that will connect to the remote hosts.\n  - `-k` to prompt for password.\n    - `sshpass` module must be installed on the controlling machine\n    - Edit `/etc/ansible/ansible.cfg` to uncomment `host_key_checking = False`\n    - If you want to test ssh communication for all the hosts in the inventory file, use option \"all\" instead of a group or a specific host\n- To get setup info\n  - `ansible -i ./hosts servers -m setup -u student -k`\n- To setup ssh authentication\n- You can omit the `-u` and `-k` option you can declare them in the inventory file.\n\n```ini\n[servers]\n\nvps1 ansible_host=207.154.254.221\nvps2 ansible_host=167.122.186.63\nvps3 ansible_host=139.59.155.232\n\n[servers:vars]\nansible_user=student\nansible_ssh_pass=clearPW123\nansible_become_pass=sudoPWroot\nansible_port=22\n```\n\n- You should use a vault to securely pass your credentials instead of hardcoding it.\n- To overwrite variables for a specific host, such as using a different user to authenticate\n\n```ini\n[servers]\n\nvps1 ansible_host=207.154.254.221 ansible_user=student2\nvps2 ansible_host=167.122.186.63\nvps3 ansible_host=139.59.155.232\n\n[servers:vars]\nansible_user=student\nansible_ssh_pass=clearPW123\nansible_port=22\n```\n\n## Ad-Hoc Commands VS Playbooks\n\n- Ad-Hoc commands can be used to do quick and simple things like checking the logs, checking if a process is running, or installing a package on a list of servers.\n- Playbooks are used for big deployments, orchestration or system configuration. We use the `ansible` command to run an Ad-Hoc command and the `ansible-playbook` command to run a playbook.\n- `ansible` is used to run Ad-Hoc commands. These commands are quick and easy but are not reusable. You don't save them for later, they demonstrate the simplicity and power of ansible.\n  - Some examples are rebooting servers, updating servers, copy files, manage package, users.\n- Playbooks are scripts written in [[devlog.YAML]] and are composed of one or more play in an ordered list and each play executes one or more tasks using ansible modules.\n- Both Ad-Hoc commands and Playbooks use modules to perform different tasks. Modules are units of code that do the actual work in Ansible.\n\n## Ad-Hoc Commands\n\n### The Shell Module\n\nThe general syntax of running an Ad-Hoc command is:\n\n`ansible -i [path-to-invetory-file] [group-to-connect-to] -m [module] -a [module-arguments] -u [user] -k`\n`ansible -i ./hosts servers -m shell -a \"df -h\" -u user1 -k`\n\nBy default ansible uses multi-threading, with 5 threads as the default. If you've more than 5 hosts, you can increase the threads using the `-f` option.\n\nExample:\n\n`ansible -i ./hosts servers -m shell -a \"ip address show dev eth0 | grep ether | cut -d ' ' -f6 | grep -v \">>\"`\n\n### The Script Module\n\n- This module can be used to run a local shell script on a remote system.\n- The classical method of doing something like this would be to first copy the script to the remote machines using [[devlog.scp]], connect to it and run the script.\n- Using the script module, the controlling machine's script is run on each host(in fact the local script is transferred to remote node and then executed).\n- This module is also supported for Windows targets.\n\nExample:\n\n`ansible -i ./hosts servers -m scripts -a \"./backsup.sh\" --become -K`\n\n`--become` to run the script as [[devlog.root]] on the host machines\n`-K` to prompt for [[devlog.sudo]] password (you can omit this if you've already declared it inside the inventory file)\n\n### The APT Module\n\n- This module automates software installation, removal and update.\n- It allows you to manage packages on Ubuntu(Debian) Distributions.\n- If you use other distros, use the corresponding package managers.\n\nExample:\n\nInstall a specific software on all the hosts.\n\nThe `state` option indicates the desired state of a package.\n\n`ansible -i ./hosts severs -m apt -a \"name=nmap state=present update_cache=true\" -u [user] -k --become -K`\n\n- Remove a specific software on all the hosts.\n\n`ansible -i ./hosts severs -m apt -a \"name=nmap state=absent purge=yes update_cache=true\" --become`\n\n- To perform a full system update on all the hosts.\n\n`ansible -i ./hosts servers -m apt \"upgrade=full\" --become`\n\n- To remove dependencies that are no longer required.\n\n`ansible -i ./hosts servers -m apt \"autoremove=yes autoclean=yes\" --become`\n\n### The Service Module\n\nThis module is used to control the services running on the host nodes.\n\nExamples:\n\n- To start a service on all the hosts.\n\n`ansible -i ./hosts servers -m service -a \"name=ngnix state=started\" --become`\n\n- To reload a service on all the hosts.\n\n`ansible -i ./hosts servers -m service -a \"name=ngnix state=restarted\" --become`\n\n- To stop a service on all the hosts.\n\n`ansible -i ./hosts servers -m service -a \"name=ngnix state=stopped\" --become`\n\n- Set a service to start on boot on all the hosts.\n\n`ansible -i ./hosts servers -m service -a \"name=ngnix enabled=yes\" --become`\n\n### The User & Group Module\n\n- This module is used to manage groups, user accounts and user attributes.\n\nExamples:\n\n- Creating a new group on all remote hosts\n\n`ansible -i ./hosts servers -m group -a \"name=developers state=present\" --become`\n\n- Removing an existing group from all remote hosts\n\n`ansible -i ./hosts servers -m group -a \"name=developers state=absent\" --become`\n\n- Adding a new user to all remote hosts\n  - You can give comma separated values if you want to add the user to multiple groups\n  - The last three options are optional\n    `ansible -i ./hosts servers -m user -a \"name=johndoe state=present groups=developers create_home=yes comment=\\\"new user\\\" shell=/bin/bash generate_ssh_key=yes ssh_key_bits=2048\" --become`\n\n## Resources\n\n- [geerlingguy/ansible-for-devops: Ansible for DevOps examples.](https://github.com/geerlingguy/ansible-for-devops)\n","n":0.028}}},{"i":1194,"$":{"0":{"v":"Android OS was originally meant to improve the operating systems of digital cameras.","n":0.277},"1":{"v":"\nAndroid began in 2003 as a project of the American technology company Android Inc., to develop an operating system for digital cameras. ...

An API is frequently a portal to the rest of the world for developer teams.\n\nA REST API is a set of HTTP-based standards that control how different applications communicate with one another. There are 4 basic methods, which are also referred to as CRUD operations:\n\n- POST: Create a record.\n- GET: Read a record.\n- PUT: Update a record.\n- DELETE: Delete a record.\n\nREST APIs add no new capability to [[devlog.HTTP API]]s. But it is an architectural style that was created in tandem with HTTP and most typically employs HTTP as its application layer protocol. However, REST isn’t always linked to HTTP. You can use other transfer protocols, such as FTP, SMTP, etc. and your API can still be RESTful.\n\nThe majority of HTTP APIs are on the verge of becoming completely RESTful. But not all HTTP APIs are REST APIs. To be termed a REST API, the API must meet the following architectural requirements:\n\n- **Client-Server:** A server oversees the application’s data and state in REST applications. The server connects with a client, which is responsible for handling user interactions. The two components are separated by a clear separation of responsibilities. As a result, you’ll be able to update and upgrade them in separate tracks.\n\n- **Stateless:** Client state is not maintained by servers; instead, clients handle their own application state. All of the information needed to process the client’s requests are contained in the requests to the server.\n\n- **Cacheable:** Servers must indicate whether or not their responses are cacheable. To boost performance, systems and clients might cache replies when it is convenient. They also get rid of non-cacheable data, so no client has to deal with stale data.\n\n- **Uniform Interface:** REST’s most well-known characteristics are that the emphasis on a uniform interface between components is the primary aspect that distinguishes the REST architectural style from other network-based approaches. Data is provided as resources through REST services, which have a consistent namespace.\n\n- **Layered System:** The system’s components can’t look beyond their own layer. This limited scope makes it simple to add load-balancers and proxies to increase authentication security and performance.\n\nVia - [HTTP API vs REST API: 3 Critical Differentiators - Learn | Hevo](https://hevodata.com/learn/http-api-vs-rest-api/)\n\n```json\n//request\nGET api/customers/10\n\n//response\n            {\n           \"customer\":{\n              \"id\":\"10\",\n              \"name\": \"customer name\",\n              \"age\": \"28\"\n           }\n        }\n```\n","n":0.05}}},{"i":1218,"$":{"0":{"v":"RARP","n":1}}},{"i":1219,"$":{"0":{"v":"PostgreSQL","n":1}}},{"i":1220,"$":{"0":{"v":"Packer","n":1},"1":{"v":"\nPacker is HashiCorp's open-source tool for creating machine images from source configuration.

OKR is a strategic framework, whereas KPIs are measurements that exist _within_ a framework.\n\nOKR is a simplistic, black-and-white approach that uses specific metrics to track the achievement of a goal. Typically, an organization will have three to five high-level objectives and three to five key results per objective.

It embodies a preference for network automation including \"network as API\" concepts, along with continuous development, integration and deployment of new networking technologies. This methodology aligns with an \"instrument everything\" mentality that seeks to programmatically provide network performance metrics beyond typical networking teams to a broad audience including network engineers and network operations personnel.\n\n## Network DevOps Requires Automation\n\nDevOps for networking has developed in the context of IT and production teams adopting DevOps and agile development utilizing various programming languages. As software development organizations look to work more collaboratively and in a continuous process from the development stage onward, network teams that are locked in a more manual and siloed way of functioning become chokepoints. Any network operator or service provider trying to maintain that sort of agility can only do so through the systematic introduction of automation principles, including provisioning, configuration, testing, version control and deployment of application and network services. Multi-vendor Software Defined Networking (SDN) environments allow for faster implementation of new capabilities versus legacy hardware solutions, making it more important to adopt configuration management and continuous delivery.\n\n**Automation can help address the following requirements:**\n\n- **Speed of deployment**: Automation allows for quick network configuration or policy changes during the application development and test phases.\n- **Stability of infrastructure**: Automation allows developers to create tests and achieve stability of infrastructure with every application update and throughout application operation, including supporting networking for ephemeral infrastructure such as containers. Automation is the only way for Network DevOps to maintain the integrity of the underlying network architecture through multiple adjustments utilizing configuration management tools.\n- **Consistent processes**: Automation allows access to policies that are already required, established and tested to be reused across applications, without the need to re-architect the entire network infrastructure, significantly improving the efficiency, security and availability of resources throughout the lifecycle of critical applications that embody network functions.\n\nIn today's rapidly changing application-centric network environment, including technologies such as virtualization, automation, templates and APIs, Network DevOps teams need DevOps tools to keep their networks running smoothly in the face of constant application change.\n\n## Network DevOps Best Practices\n\n- **Continuous integration**: the software development practice of adding new code to a centralized repository.\n- **Continuous delivery**: the use of automation for code changes, testing and release is at the heart of efficiency in the world of Network DevOps. Automated configuration management can save time by making key processes faster and more repeatable with less IT operations hands-on management.\n- **Continuous monitoring**: Gain operational insights for both app development and operations from the constant flow of information through the Network DevOps process. While passive network data such as [[devlog.NetFlow]], [[devlog.sFlow]] and [[devlog.IPFIX]] are valuable for monitoring internal networks, particularly [[devlog.microservices]] architectures, active monitoring is needed to specifically monitor across external network dependencies.\n- **Correlate app experience and network metrics**: To be effective in collaborating with other IT teams, network teams need to be able to tie network metrics to app and user experience metrics such as HTTP response time, page load and transaction times.\n- **Continuous testing**: A combination of automated and hands-on testing is critical to comprehensive software testing. All Network DevOps testing mechanisms should extend to include microservices, version management, middleware installation and the application itself.\n\nVia - [Network DevOps Challenges and Best Practices | ThousandEyes](https://www.thousandeyes.com/learning/techtorials/network-devops)\n","n":0.042}}},{"i":1229,"$":{"0":{"v":"NFS","n":1}}},{"i":1230,"$":{"0":{"v":"NAT","n":1},"1":{"v":"\n# Network Address Translation\n","n":0.5}}},{"i":1231,"$":{"0":{"v":"Modem","n":1},"1":{"v":"\n- [[devlog.Modem]] is short for modulator/demodulator.\n- There are two kinds of signals:\n  - A computer **only** reads Digital Signal.\n  - Analog Signal that is used on the internet.\n- To deal with this a modem is introduced - whose responsibility is a to convert the signals from Digital to Analog and vice versa.\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/zubayr/image/upload/v1656493565/wiki/g8gzj19fawcjw7v4xr06.png)\n","n":0.139}}},{"i":1232,"$":{"0":{"v":"IIS","n":1},"1":{"v":"\nMicrosoft IIS (Internet Information Services) is a free web server software package for Windows Server.

Instead of creating EC2 instances and connecting the two with ECS cluster, you can create Fargate instance and connect that to the ECS cluster.\n\nIt is a serverless way to launch containers. You take a container that you want to deploy on AWS and manage by ECS. You hand over the container to Fargate, you don't need to launch/provision any virtual machines/servers on your AWS account.\n\nFargate will take your container and analyze it to check how much resources your container needs to run and it'll provision a server/resources for that specific container and deploy it and run it.\n\nIt is on-demand, you don't need to provision or manage servers; you only have the infrastructure resources needed to run your containers. You only pay for the resources your containers are consuming. It scales very easily as it doesn't have fixed resources cap defined beforehand.\n\nHowever, if you need access to the underlying infrastructure for whatever reasons, EC2 offers more flexibility in that domain.\n\nSince you're using ECS for managing your containers and Fargate for managing your infrastructure needed for those containers, you can integrate your setup with other AWS services like [[devlog.AWS CloudWatch]] for monitoring, [[devlog.AWS IAM]] for Users and Permissions, [[devlog.AWS ELB]] for [[load balancing|devlog.load balancer]], [[devlog.AWS VPC]] for networking etc.\n\nYou can use Fargate Spot, a new capability that can run interruption-tolerant ECS Tasks at up to a 70% discount off the Fargate price.\n\n**Cons:**\n\nECS + Fargate supports only one networking mode – _awsvpc_ – which limits your control over the networking layer (and you might need that in some scenarios).\n\n**Cost:** You’re charged based on the CPU and memory you select.

You can quickly deploy applications. It is great for testing. If you have a lot of dependencies and a complicated deployment process Elastic Beanstalk not be the best choice.\n- OpsWorks is a configuration management services that provides managed instances of [[devlog.chef]] and [[devlog.puppet]]. Great for hybrid environments because if node is reachable by Chef or Puppet instances(On-prem), it can be registered with OpsWorks.\n- CloudFormation compared to Elastic Beanstalk deals more with AWS infrastructure rather than applications. It is geared towards system engineers, CloudFormation uses templates to create, replicate AWS infrastructure stacks rather than applications.\n\n### How to use all three together?\n\n- CloudFormation has resource definitions for both Elastic Beanstalk  and OpsWorks, which would enable implementing both of them in CloudFormation stack.\n- Build the infrastructure with CloudFormation and manage applications with OpsWorks and Elastic Beanstalk.\n\n\n## Create an Elastic Beanstalk Application\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/zubayr/image/upload/v1655629696/wiki/kgz2k1qy0gt3433reler.png)\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/zubayr/image/upload/v1655629915/wiki/qmwmq00kynqimsw13ehu.png)\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/zubayr/image/upload/v1655630013/wiki/nsvk6zntgfhyb3iw4lcm.png)\n\n## Elastic Beanstalk deployment strategies\n\nWe’ve two environment types in Elastic Beanstalk:\n\n- Single instance \n\t- Has elastic IP address\n\t- With a auto scaling group, you can have high availability even with a single instance.\n- High availability\n\t- We have a group of instances\n\t- Auto scaling group\n\t- Load balancer\n\nDeployment Methods\n\n- All at once\n\t- Performs updates all at once\n\t- In place deployment - infrastructure doesn’t change at all\n\t- Fast and requires no DNS changes \n\t- Will complicate rollback a little bit\n\t- Increased down time if something goes wrong\n- Rolling\n\t- Will guarantee one of the instance is up at all times\n\t- When update is ongoing - they’ll be detached from the load balancer\n\t- When the update is completed, they’re reattached, load balancer will perform health check(overhead)\n\t- Health checks failing may lead to different instances with different versions of applications \n- Rolling/Additional batch\n\t- Updates are performed on newly created instances not on live instances\n\t- We double auto scaling group’s capacity so we don’t run into capacity issues\n\t- Takes longer than regular update(overhead)\n\t- Go with this when you can’t afford reduced capacity(downtime)\n- Immutable\n\t- Instances are not changed(updated) they’re completely replaced\n\t- New instances with the update is added to Auto Scaling Group and previous instances are killed(only if the new deployment is successful)\n\t- Provides clean rollback\n\t- Needs doubling of instances for a short time\n- Blue/Green\n\t- Entire environment is cloned(Auto Scaling Group and Load Balancer)\n\t- Update is deployed to the cloned environment \n\t- Route53 URLs are swapped with the updated instances once deployment is successful.\n\t- Prevents downtime because new resources are used\n\t- Can be tested in an isolated environment \n\t- Con: we’re doubling our resources, requires DNS name change\n- Canary\n\t- Allows you to roll out new code/features to a subset of users as an initial test\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/zubayr/image/upload/v1655632839/wiki/xxzvbggiv1zttmngmv42.png)\n\n## Elastic Beanstalk Environment configuration management \n\n- You can configure your Elastic Beanstalk Environment’s configuration using a fodler named `.ebextentions` inside which your config files go.\n- You can add specific settings for all of the components of your environment like taking care of dependencies, Auto Scaling Group etc.\n- We can also your configurations and load from them at a later point.\n- Changes made from CLI or console have highest precedence, next settings loaded from a saved configurations.

You can migrate to EKS without applying any changes to the code.\n- Supports **EC2 spot instances** using managed node groups that follow spot best practices and allow some pretty great cost savings.\n\n## Managing a Kubernetes cluster\n\nSetting up a cluster in EKS is relatively complicated and comes with some prerequisites. You need to set up and use the AWS CLI and aws-iam-authenticator, and set up IAM permissions and users which adds to your workload.\n\nEKS doesn’t create worker nodes automatically, so you’re also in charge of managing that process. You also need to make extra effort to set up EKS with CloudFormation or Terraform.\n\n- EKS comes with a **well-defined way of upgrading the control plane with minimized disruption**. You can then update worker nodes using the newer Kubernetes AMI, create a new worker group, and finally migrate your workload to the new nodes.\n- **Scaling up the cluster is simple** and based on adding more worker nodes. The control plane is fully managed, so there’s no need to worry about adding or upgrading master node sizes when your cluster grows.\n- **Carrying out the most common maintenance tasks** is easy in EKS – you can add worker nodes, replace them, terminate instances, and upgrade your setup with minimal disruption to your cluster.\n\nVia - [AWS EKS vs. ECS vs. Fargate vs. Kops: Where to Manage Your Kubernetes in 2022? - CAST AI – Kubernetes Automation Platform](https://cast.ai/blog/aws-eks-vs-ecs-vs-fargate-where-to-manage-your-kubernetes/)\n\n## How does EKS work?\n\nYou create a EKS cluster which represents a control plane. These will be master nodes.\n\nWhen you create an EKS service/cluster AWS will provision Kubernetes master nodes that already have Kubernetes master services installed on them.\n\nSince they're managed by AWS EKS, it'll automatically replicate the master nodes across multiple Availability Zones.\n\nEtcd is part of the master nodes which store the whole configuration/the current state of Kubernetes cluster. This storage is also replicated/backed up by AWS.\n\nFor Worker Nodes:\n\nYou'll create [[devlog.AWS EC2]] instances, so called \"Compute Fleet\" of multiple virtual servers and connect them to EKS.\n\nWorker nodes have Kubernetes process running on it so the Kubernetes master node can communicate with them.\n\nIn this case also, you need to manage the EC2 instance for your worker nodes, yourself.\n\nYou have the option of \"semi-managed\" EC2 instances for your cluster. EKS with Nodegroup. The Nodegroup will handle some of the heavy lifting for you. Basically make it easier for you to configure new worker nodes for your cluster.\nFor example: Worker nodes managed by nodegroup will get all the processes necessary installed on them(like container runtime, K8s processes) transform them into Worker Nodes.\n\nIt is a good practice to use Nodegroups.\n\nYou still need to configure things like [[devlog.AWS ASG]]. Even this can be delegated to AWS you can again combine [[devlog.AWS Fargate]] for your EKS cluster.\n\nFully managed worker nodes with Fargate and Fully managed control plane(master nodes) with EKS.\n\nYou can also use EC2 and Fargate in the same EKS cluster.\n\n## Setting up EKS Cluster\n\n- Master nodes\n  - Provision an EKS cluster\n- Worker nodes\n  - Create Nodegroup of EC2 instances(compute fleet)\n  - OR you can use Fargate\n- Connect Nodegroup with EKS cluster\n- Connect to cluster using `kubectl`\n  - Deploy your containerized applications\n\n## Creating EKS Cluster via Management Console\n\n**Overview/steps**\n\n1. Create [[devlog.AWS IAM]] Role for EKS service\n\nRole is created so the EKS service(attached) has the permissions/policies to create things in AWS account. To allow AWS to create and manage components on our behalf/on our account.\n\n2. Create a VPC\n\nThis is where our worker nodes will run. \n\nA new VPC is created because EKS cluster needs specific networking configuration for it to work properly. It needs [[devlog.kubernetes]] and AWS specific networking rules, worker node specific firewall configuration. It is necessary for master nodes to communicate with them and manage them.\n\nDefault VPC is not optimized for EKS cluster(not the best practice).\n\nExamples of rules:\n\nFirewall rules (of subnets) that are configured by Network ACLs, inside the subnet you’ve EC2 instances. EC2 instances have their own firewall rules that are defined by security groups.\n\nIt is a best practice to create/configure subnets in worker node VPC, i.e creating **public** subnets and **private** subnets(creating external load balancer). \n\nThrough IAM Role you give Kubernetes permissions  to change VPC configuration(Nodeport service; to open ports on our behalf in our VPC etc).\n\nYou can use templates provided by AWS instead of creating the VPC by ourselves.\n\n3. Create EKS Cluster (Control Plane)\n\nThese will be a set of master nodes that are managed by AWS.\n\n4. Connect to the cluster using `kubectl`\n\nTo connect to this cluster from our local machine.\n\n5. Create IAM Role for EC2 service\n\nTo give EC2 service the permissions to call AWS API and configure, create stuff in our AWS account. Essentially to create worker nodes for the EKS cluster.\n\n6. Create Node Group, attach it to EKS cluster\n\nNode Group is a group of EC2 instances that are gonna run as worker nodes in the EKS cluster(master nodes).\n\n7. Configure Auto Scaling\n\nThis is created so that the number of EC2 instances are intelligently scaled up/down to match resource requirement.\n\n8.

This data can help you determine an optimal deployment strategy for each container. Additionally, you can leverage ECS to scale containers and release updates as needed.\n\nECS supports integration with several useful AWS services and features, including Identity and Access Management ([[devlog.AWS IAM]]) roles, Elastic Block Store ([[devlog.AWS EBS]]) volumes, and AWS Elastic Load Balancing ([[devlog.AWS ELB]]).\n\nIt manages the entire lifecycle of a container, whether you need to spin some up, reschedule, restart, load balance. It has got you covered.\n\n## ECS Cluster\n\nTo get started you need to create an ECS cluster. That will contain all the services that are needed to manage the individual containers.\n\nECS Cluster basically represents a control plane for all your virtual machines running containers.\n\nThe containers need to run on actual machines...these virtual machines will be [[devlog.AWS EC2]] instances. ECS Cluster is just providing a \"Control Plane\" for managing all of this.\n\nThe EC2 instance created will not isolated but it'll be connected and managed by the Control Plane processes installed on ECS Cluster that we created.\n\n- Those EC2 instances will have [[devlog.docker]]/container runtime so that containers can run.\n- They'll also have ECS agents installed so they can communicate with each EC2 instance and manage them.\n\n**Pros:**\n\nYou have full control over the type of EC2 instance used here. For example, you can use a GPU-optimized instance type if you need to run training for a machine learning model that comes with unique GPU requirements.\nYou can take advantage of spot instances that reduce cloud costs by up to 90%.\n\n**Cons:**\n\nYou’re the one responsible for security patches and network security of the instances, as well as their scalability in the cluster (but thankfully, you can use Kubernetes autoscaling for that).\n\nYou'd still need to manage the EC2 instances like creating them, joining them with your ECS cluster, when a new container is scheduled; you have to make sure that you've enough resources for it).

Inferential statistics solves the measurement dilemma as long, of course, as you follow some basic rules such as randomization and appropriate sample size.\n\nRandomization allows researchers to make inferences about a population based on the way a sample is chosen.

Rhetoric aims to study the techniques writers or speakers utilize to inform, persuade, or motivate particular audiences in specific situations. Taking place in Athens in the early fifth century, the demos (\"the people\") created \"a strategy for effectively talking to other people in juries, forums, and the senate\". Aristotle defines rhetoric as \"the faculty of observing in any given case the available means of persuasion\" and since mastery of the art was necessary for victory in a case at law, for passage of proposals in the assembly, or for fame as a speaker in civic ceremonies, he calls it \"a combination of the science of logic and of the ethical branch of politics\". Rhetoric typically provides heuristics for understanding, discovering, and developing arguments for particular situations, such as Aristotle's three persuasive audience appeals: logos, pathos, and ethos. The five canons of rhetoric or phases of developing a persuasive speech were first codified in classical Rome: invention, arrangement, style, memory, and delivery.From Ancient Greece to the late 19th century, rhetoric played a central role in Western education in training orators, lawyers, counsellors, historians, statesmen, and poets as it is the most used form of communication between person to person.\n\n> - via [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhetoric)\n","n":0.065}}},{"i":1315,"$":{"0":{"v":"Religion","n":1}}},{"i":1316,"$":{"0":{"v":"Relationships","n":1},"1":{"v":"\n## Articles\n\n## Books\n\n## Podcasts\n\n![[resources.podcast.David Buss Sex, Dating, Relationships, and Sex Differences]]\n\n## Notes\n\n- Be an extreme version of yourself(don't try to not be a nerd, embrace that) - and ask out a lot of people.\n- People who are perpetually single are trying to date the small number of people that everyone else is trying to date\n- It's not lowering your standards, it's changing what your standards consists of.

Psychology attempts to uncover what people do along with why,\nwhat, and how they do it.\n\n- People are not “models,” but the models can be helpful in understanding people!\n- If they can cause it to happen, then they can un-cause it to happen, too. And that means they understand why and how it’s happening. This is a type of reverse psychological engineering for figuring out the why, what, and how questions of human behavior. (It’s also a good example of an empirical approach in as much as the process is observable and testable.)\n- Knowing what a person's functions are. The foundations of this function approach are built on a philosophy know as functionalism, which is the notion that the mind, mental processes, and behavior are “tools” for adaptive functioning that lead to a human functioning most effectively in his or her environment (survival and perpetuation of the species).\n- It is obvious that psychology can be very reductionist. That is, it tries to take an extremely complex phenomenon, people, and break it down into parts and simple explanations. We’ve broken apart Humpty Dumpty, but can we put him back together again? People are not made up of X, Y, and Z. People are not just whys, whats, and hows. We’re not theories, models, experiments, or Dr. Cash’s “monsters.”\n- Each of us is an amateur psychologist of sorts.

These broad theoretical frameworks are sometimes referred to as metatheories.\n\n- Biological\n\nThe biological approach centers on the biological underpinnings of behavior, including the effects of evolution and genetics. Biological psychologists focus mostly on the brain and the nervous system. Neuropsychology and the study of the brain, genetics, and evolutionary psychology are included within the biological metatheory.\n\n- Behaviorism\n\nBehaviorism emphasizes the role and influence of a person’s environment and previous learning experiences to understanding behavior. Behaviorists don’t traditionally focus on mental processes per se because they believe that mental pro- cesses are too difficult to observe and measure objectively. In the framework of behaviorism, the “why” of behavior can be explained by looking at the circum- stances in which it occurs and the consequences surrounding someone’s actions. Classical conditioning and operant conditioning are ways of understanding behavior and they lead to behavior modification, a specific approach to modifying behavior, and helping people change that comes from the metatheory of behaviorism.\n\n- Cognitive\n\nThe cognitive framework centers on the mental processing of information, including the specific functions of attention, concentration, reasoning, problem solving, and memory. Cognitive psychologists are interested in the mental plans and thoughts that guide and cause behavior and affect how people feel. Intelligence testing and information-processing theories are examples that fall within the cognitive metatheory.\n\nPeople can change the way they think about a situation. You can choose to look on the bright side — or at least not look solely at the downside. That’s the gist of cognitive therapy.\n\n- Sociocultural\n\nThe sociocultural approach focuses on the social and cultural factors that affect behavior. Therefore, as you might expect, social and cross-cultural psychology fall within the sociocultural metatheory, which is all about the enormous power of groups and culture on the why, how, and what of behavior and mental processes.\n\n- Developmental\n\nThe Greek philosopher Heraclitus is credited with saying, “The only constant in\nlife is change.” Developmental psychology is a metatheory that is built on the idea that mental processes and behavior change over time, from one mental process and behavior to another in a progressive manner. Mental processes are built from and upon previous ones. Behaviors are built from and upon previous ones.\n\n- Evolutionary\n\nEvolutionary psychology searches for the causes and explanations for mental processes and behavior through the lens of adaptive fitness and natural selection. The basic idea is that mental processes and behaviors are the product of the “selection through mating” for processes and behaviors that helped solve recurring prob- lems facing humans across large swathes of time. Whereas developmental approaches emphasize change over the lifespan of an individual, evolutionary psychology emphasizes change over generations. Traits that were particularly helpful for survival, such as problem-solving and cooperating with others were “kept” and passed on to subsequent generations. Mental process or behavior that led to a person living long enough to pass on his or her genes stayed in the gene pool. Those that did not were dropped from the gene pool. Additionally, there is a branch of psychology known as comparative psychology that studies animal behavior as an analog for human behavior. Studying animals can help us understand humans, and evolutionary psychology is the foundation of and justification for this approach.\n\n- Humanistic and existential\n\nThe humanistic and existential metatheory emphasizes that each person is unique and that humans have the ability and responsibility to make choices in their lives. I’m not a victim of circumstance! I have choices in my life. Humanists believe that a person’s free choice, free will, and understanding of the meaning of events in his or her life are the most important things to study in order to understand behavior. The works of Victor Frankl, Rollo May, and Fritz Perls along with the study of spirituality and religion are examples that fall within this framework.\n\nPsychologists who work within the humanistic and existential metatheory believe that behavior is simply a result of choice.\n\n- Psychoanalytic/psychodynamic\n\nThe psychoanalytic/psychodynamic metatheory emphasizes the importance of unconscious mental processes, early child development, personality, the self, attachment patterns, and relationships. This approach explores how these mental and developmental processes interact with the challenges of life and everyday demands to affect the person you are and how you behave. [[resources.people.Sigmund Freud]] founded psychoanalysis in the early 1900s; since then, hundreds of theorists have added to his work. The later theories are typically labeled psychodynamic because they emphasize the dynamic interplay between various components of mind, the self, personality, others, and reality. Object Relations Theory and Self Psychology are two specific theoretical perspectives that fall within the psychoanalytic/psychodynamic metatheory.\n\n- Postmodernism\n\nThe Postmodern metatheory questions the very core of psychological science, challenging its approach to truth and its focus on the individual. Postmodernists propose, for example, that in order to understand human thinking and reason,need to look at the social and communal processes involved in thinking and reason. Reality is not something that is out there independently; it is something that humans, as a community, create. Postmodernists make the argument that people in powerful positions have too much to say about what is “real” and “true” in psychology, and they advocatesocial constructionist view of reality, which states that the concepts of “reality” and “truth” are defined, or constructed, by society. These concepts, according to this framework, have no meaning apart from the meanings that society and its experts assign to them. Narrative and constructionist theories are examples that fall within the metatheory of Postmodernism.\n\n- Biopsychosocial Model\n\nOne alternative to picking a metatheory is to combine several views together, thus adopting an integrationist or unifying approach. The biopsychosocial model of psychology represents a popular attempt at integration. The basic idea behind this model is that human behavior and mental processes are the products of:\n\n1. biological\n2. psychological\n3. social influences\n\nBiopsychosocialists try to find out how these influences interact to produce behavior. They believe that any explanation of behavior and mental processes that doesn’t consider all three primary factors (body, mind, and environment) is incomplete.\n\n---\n\nPsychologists accept that the mind exists in, or is synonymous with, the brain.\nThe biological metatheory is integrated into the biopsychosocial model because of this component. You may say that, just as digestion is what the stomach does, “mind” is what the brain does.\n\nBrains don’t work and minds don’t think in a vacuum. Behavior and mental pro-\ncesses are embedded within a context that includes other people and things in the environment in which people live. Therefore, the social aspect of the biopsychosocial model also includes parent-child relationships, families, communities, and culture. Overlooking the impact of a person’s interaction with family and friends is to neglect reality. Just as the influence of family and friend relations is critical, it is also vital that psychologists consider cultural differences.\n\n## Nature VS Nurture\n\nNature refers to the concept that behavior and mental processes are innate, inborn, and hard-wired and will unfold over time as a person develops and her genetic blueprint is revealed. Nurture refers to the idea that behavior and mental processes are not inborn and instead are learned from the environment in which people live.\n\nJohn Locke, a 17th-century British philosopher, espoused the concept of tabula rasa, the “blank slate” and believed that, given the right learning experiences, a person can become anything in life. On the other side is Charles Darwin, the father of evolution and nature advocate, who believed that a person’s destiny is found in his or her biology and genes.\n\nMost modern psychologists consider this debate over. The simple answer is that both nature and nurture impact a person’s behavior and level of success. This means that making sense of what people do and why they do it is ultimately accomplished only by investigating and understanding the relative contributions of innate biological influences and learned environmental influences\n\n![[archive.theory]]\n\nPsychologists strive to maintain their expertise and knowledge through the use of three forms of knowledge acquisition or ways of knowing:\n\n- Authority: Utilized to transmit information, usually in a therapy setting or the education and training process. Patients and students don’t have time to go out and research everything that they’re told. They have to take someone’s word for it at some point.\n- Rationalism/logic: Used to create theories and hypotheses. If things don’t make logical sense, they probably won’t make sense when researchers use the scientific method to investigate them.\n- Scientific method: Used as the preferred method of obtaining information and investigating behavior and mental processes. Psychologists implement the scientific method through a variety of different techniques.\n\nA good-sized chunk of information that’s out there is also purely theoretical, but it makes sense on rational or logical grounds.\n\n---\n\nPsychologists use two broad categories of research when they want to scientifically evaluate a theory: descriptive research and experimental research.\n\nDescriptive research consists of observation and the collection of data without trying to manipulate any of the conditions or circumstances being observed. They don’t help much if you’re interested in cause and effect relationships.\n\nExperimental research involves the control and manipulation of the objects and events being investigated in order to get a better idea of the cause and effect relationships between the objects or events.\n\nA z-factor is something affecting the hypothesis that I am unaware of or not accounting for. It is an extraneous variable that I need to control in order to have confidence in my theory. Good research studies try to eliminate z-factors or extraneous variables by controlling for their influence and factoring them out of the explanation.\n\n---\n\n![[archive.Falsifiability]]\n\n---\n\nGenerally, two types of statistical analyses are used in psychology, descriptive and inferential:\n\n![[areas.statistics##statistics-used-in-psychology]]\n\n---\n\n## Correlation VS Causation\n\nA variable is the thing, characteristic, behavior, or mental process that is being measured or observed. Psychologists are interested in how variables relate, that is how do the things that are measured affect, impact, or alter each other?\n\nIn research, there are two types of variables, independent and dependent. A dependent variable is the thing that is\nimpacted or altered as a function of the independent variable. The independent variable impacts the dependent variable as it changes. The value of the dependent variable is directly caused or influenced by the independent variable.\n\nDoes that mean that if two variables are related that there is a causal relationship?\nNo, sometimes variables can be involved in a non-causal manner known as a correlation or a correlational relationship. A correlation exists between two ­variables when the value of one is related to the value of the other but not necessarily in a causal manner.\n\nA correlation can be mistaken for causation(conjecture); just because two variables are related does not mean that one causes the other to happen. Correlation, not causation.\n\n## The Placebo Effect\n\nWhen psychologists want to test the impact of independent variables on dependent variables. They go with a simple\nexperimental and control group approach. An experimental group is the group that is getting the independent variable, and the control group is not; it is getting nothing in essence.\n\nThere is another variation of this approach that is often used to help make the impact of the independent variable stand out more. This is done by using a **placebo group** in addition to the control group. A placebo is a decoy variable of sorts, a fake independent variable that is **not** expected to have an impact on the dependent variable, but the person in the study thinks it is an actual treatment or independent variable.\n\nThe placebo group quite often shows change or improvement. This is known as the placebo effect, when an experimental\neffect is related to the presence of the placebo. A fascinating phenomenon is one that scientists from all fields are trying to learn more about but have not quite figured out yet.\n\n---\n\n![[archive.mind]]\n\nThe idea that all of human psychology can be reduced to biology is known as biological reductionism.\n\nThis idea seems to insult our closely guarded and esteemed sense of free will, self-awareness, and consciousness. how can all this complex stuff going on inside my mind be reduced to a hunk of flesh resting between my ears?\n\nWe can’t escape our brains and genes, so biology and psychology are stuck with each other. But this relationship doesn’t have to be contentious as long as we adopt the monist stance.\n\n![[archive.brain]]\n","n":0.02}}},{"i":1322,"$":{"0":{"v":"Project Management","n":0.707}}},{"i":1323,"$":{"0":{"v":"Programming","n":1},"1":{"v":"\n## Resources\n\n- [How to Learn Programming – The Guide I Wish I Had When I Started Learning to Code](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-learn-programming/)\n","n":0.229}}},{"i":1324,"$":{"0":{"v":"Probability","n":1}}},{"i":1325,"$":{"0":{"v":"Pop Culture","n":0.707}}},{"i":1326,"$":{"0":{"v":"Politics","n":1}}},{"i":1327,"$":{"0":{"v":"Philosophy","n":1}}},{"i":1328,"$":{"0":{"v":"Persuasion","n":1}}},{"i":1329,"$":{"0":{"v":"Noetics","n":1},"1":{"v":"\n# Noetics\n\nrelating to mental activity or the intellect.\n\n---\n\nIn philosophy, **Noetics** is a branch of metaphysics concerned with the study of mind as well as intellect.

Ideally you use several different sentences that all cover the same vocabulary to build a better mental model of how those words behave in the language.\n\nSentence mining is such an effective technique because it recognises the holistic nature of languages as a form of knowledge.\n\nWhen you learn with sentences, you're getting a series of complete learning packages. Sentences demonstrate the associations between the words they contain (collocation), they show how the words relate to the grammar and structure of the sentence, and they dramatically increase your opportunities to link your language knowledge together.\n\nVia - [Sentence mining | Chinese Boost | Learn Chinese](https://www.chineseboost.com/blog/sentence-mining/)\n\n---\n\n**We learn best through compelling, comprehensible input**\n\n- **Compelling** — What I learn must be interesting and relevant to me, or else I’ll quit.\n- **Comprehensible** — I must understand (not 100%, but the main idea), or else the language is nonsense, and I’ll quit.

That may be fine, in most cases, but among other possible dangers it can cause us to gravitate  toward what is familiar, comfortable, easy – towards a state in which little significant learning is happening at all.\n\nFocus, concentrate, set goals – let your spotlight shine bright. But occasionally peer out into the floodlight and make sure you like what you see. — via [How does your learning light shine? - Mission to Learn - Lifelong Learning Blog](https://www.missiontolearn.com/spotlight-floodlight-alan-watts/)\n\n## Resources\n\n- [Learn Better with 10 Ways to Be a Better Learner - Lifelong Learning](https://www.missiontolearn.com/learn-better/)\n- [Learning How to Learn: Powerful mental tools to help you master tough subjects | Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn?action=enroll)\n","n":0.038}}},{"i":1342,"$":{"0":{"v":"Law","n":1}}},{"i":1343,"$":{"0":{"v":"Islam","n":1},"1":{"v":"\n- Areas: [[Religion]]\n\n---\n","n":0.577}}},{"i":1344,"$":{"0":{"v":"Intuition","n":1},"1":{"v":"\nOne of my core [[tags.principles]] is to always trust me gut.

The term can also refer to the study of such constraints, a field that includes domains such as phonology, morphology, and syntax, often complemented by phonetics, semantics, and pragmatics. There are currently two different approaches to the study of grammar, traditional grammar and theoretical grammar.\n\nFluent speakers of a language variety or lect have effectively internalized these constraints, the vast majority of which – at least in the case of one's native language(s) – are acquired not by conscious study or instruction but by hearing other speakers. Much of this internalization occurs during early childhood; learning a language later in life usually involves more explicit instruction. In this view, grammar is understood as the cognitive information underlying a specific instance of language production.The term \"grammar\" can also describe the linguistic behavior of groups of speakers and writers, rather than individuals. Differences in scales are important to this sense of the word: for example, the term \"English grammar\" could refer to the whole of English grammar (that is, to the grammars of all the speakers of the language), in which case the term encompasses a great deal of variation. At a smaller scale, it may refer only to what is shared among the grammars of all or most English speakers (such as subject–verb–object word order in simple declarative sentences). At the smallest scale, this sense of \"grammar\" can describe the conventions of just one relatively well-defined form of English (such as standard English for a region).A description, study, or analysis of such rules may also be referred to as grammar. A reference book describing the grammar of a language is called a \"reference grammar\" or simply \"a grammar\" (see History of English grammars). A fully explicit grammar which exhaustively describes the grammatical constructions of a particular speech variety is called descriptive grammar. This kind of linguistic description contrasts with linguistic prescription, an attempt to actively discourage or suppress some grammatical constructions, while codifying and promoting others, either in an absolute sense or about a standard variety. For example, some prescriptivists maintain that sentences in English should not end with prepositions, a prohibition that has been traced to John Dryden (13 April 1668 – January 1688) whose unexplained objection to the practice perhaps led other English speakers to avoid the construction and discourage its use. Yet preposition stranding has a long history in Germanic languages like English, where it is so widespread as to be a standard usage.Outside linguistics, the term grammar is often used in a rather different sense. It may be used more broadly to include conventions of spelling and punctuation, which linguists would not typically consider as part of grammar but rather as part of orthography, the conventions used for writing a language. It may also be used more narrowly to refer to a set of prescriptive norms only, excluding those aspects of a language's grammar which are not subject to variation or debate on their normative acceptability. Jeremy Butterfield claimed that, for non-linguists, \"Grammar is often a generic way of referring to any aspect of English that people object to.\"\n\n> - via [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammar)\n","n":0.043}}},{"i":1350,"$":{"0":{"v":"Genetics","n":1}}},{"i":1351,"$":{"0":{"v":"Food","n":1}}},{"i":1352,"$":{"0":{"v":"Fallacy","n":1},"1":{"v":"\n- Areas: [[areas.argumentation theory]], [[areas.decision making]], [[areas.rhetoric]], [[areas.religion]], [[areas.discourse]]\n\n---\n\nA fallacy is the use of invalid or otherwise faulty reasoning, or \"wrong moves\", in the construction of an argument, which may appear stronger than it really is if the fallacy is not spotted.

Despite millennia of analyses, definitions, explanations and debates by philosophers and scientists, consciousness remains puzzling and controversial, being \"at once the most familiar and [also the] most mysterious aspect of our lives\". Perhaps the only widely agreed notion about the topic is the intuition that consciousness exists. Opinions differ about what exactly needs to be studied and explained as consciousness. Sometimes, it is synonymous with the mind, and at other times, an aspect of mind. In the past, it was one's \"inner life\", the world of introspection, of private thought, imagination and volition. Today, it often includes any kind of cognition, experience, feeling or perception. It may be awareness, awareness of awareness, or self-awareness either continuously changing or not. There might be different levels or orders of consciousness, or different kinds of consciousness, or just one kind with different features. Other questions include whether only humans are conscious, all animals, or even the whole universe. The disparate range of research, notions and speculations raises doubts about whether the right questions are being asked.\n\nExamples of the range of descriptions, definitions or explanations are: simple wakefulness, one's sense of selfhood or soul explored by \"looking within\"; being a metaphorical \"stream\" of contents, or being a mental state, mental event or mental process of the brain; having phanera or qualia and subjectivity; being the 'something that it is like' to 'have' or 'be' it; being the \"inner theatre\" or the executive control system of the mind.\n\nVia - [Consciousness - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consciousness)\n\n---\n\n## Spotlight consciousness and Lantern Consciousness\n\nGenerally speaking, we have two kinds of consciousness. One I will call the “spotlight,” and the other the “floodlight.” The spotlight is what we call conscious attention, and we are trained from childhood that it is the most valuable form of perception. When the teacher in class says “Pay attention!” everybody stares, and looks right at the teacher. That is spotlight consciousness; fixing your mind on one thing at a time. You concentrate, and even though you may not be able to have a very long attention span, nevertheless you use your spotlight: one thing after another, one thing after another…\n\nHowever we also have floodlight consciousness. For example, you can drive your car for several miles with a friend sitting next to you, and be completely absorbed in talking to your friend. Nevertheless, your floodlight consciousness will manage the driving of the car, will notice all the stoplights, the other idiots on the road, and so on, and you will get there safely without even thinking about it.\n\nVia - [How does your learning light shine? - Mission to Learn - Lifelong Learning Blog](https://www.missiontolearn.com/spotlight-floodlight-alan-watts/)\n\n> Dr. Watts said that definable objects and events do not exist in nature; they exist only because men have arbitrarily agreed on certain labels for convenience's sake. Labels are used to impose an order on nature that doesn't in fact exist, but is needed in order to understand the universe.\n\nWhen we live in a framework of labels, we use a type of awareness tb Dr. Watts called **\"spotlight consciousness\"** as opposed to a second kind of perception, **\"floodlight consciousness.\"** Spotlight consciousness takes the form of words, numbers and concepts that we use to notate the things that interest us. Dr. Watts used calculus as an example to illustrate his point.

It has a dualistic cosmology of good and evil within the framework of a monotheistic ontology and an eschatology which predicts the ultimate conquest of evil by good. Zoroastrianism exalts an uncreated and benevolent deity of wisdom known as Ahura Mazda (lit. 'Lord of Wisdom') as its supreme being. Historically, the unique features of Zoroastrianism, such as its monotheism, messianism, belief in free will and judgement after death, conception of heaven, hell, angels, and demons, among other concepts, may have influenced other religious and philosophical systems, including the Abrahamic religions and Gnosticism, Northern Buddhism, and Greek philosophy.With possible roots dating back to the 2nd millennium BCE, Zoroastrianism enters recorded history around the middle of the 6th century BCE. It served as the state religion of the ancient Iranian empires for more than a millennium, approximately from 600 BCE to 650 CE, but declined from the 7th century CE onwards as a direct result of the Muslim conquest of Persia (633–654 CE) which led to the large-scale persecution of the Zoroastrian people. Recent estimates place the current number of Zoroastrians in the world at around 110,000–120,000 at most, with the majority of this figure living in India, Iran, and North America; their number has been thought to be declining.The most important texts of Zoroastrianism are those contained within the Avesta, which includes the central writings thought to be composed by Zoroaster known as the Gathas, as well as poems within the Yasna that define the teachings of Zoroaster, which serve as the basis for worship. The religious philosophy of Zoroaster divided the early Iranian gods of the Proto-Indo-Iranian tradition into emanations of the natural world as ahuras and daevas, the latter of which were not considered to be worthy of worship. Zoroaster proclaimed that Ahura Mazda was the supreme creator, the creative and sustaining force of the universe through Asha, and that human beings are given a choice between supporting Ahura Mazda or not, making them ultimately responsible for their choices. Though Ahura Mazda has no equal contesting force, Angra Mainyu (destructive spirit/mentality), whose forces are born from Aka Manah (evil thought), is considered to be the main adversarial force of the religion, standing against Spenta Mainyu (creative spirit/mentality). Middle Persian literature developed Angra Mainyu further into Ahriman, advancing him to be the direct adversary to Ahura Mazda.Additionally, the life force that originates from Ahura Mazda, known as Asha (truth, cosmic order), stands in opposition to Druj (falsehood, deceit). Ahura Mazda is considered to be all-good with no evil emanating from the deity. Ahura Mazda works in gētīg (the visible material realm) and mēnōg (the invisible spiritual and mental realm) through the seven (six when excluding Spenta Mainyu) Amesha Spentas.Zoroastrianism is not entirely uniform in theological and philosophical thought, especially with historical and modern influences having a significant impact on individual and local beliefs, practices, values and vocabulary, sometimes merging with tradition and in other cases displacing it. The ultimate purpose in the life of a practicing Zoroastrian is to become an ashavan (a master of Asha) and to bring happiness into the world, which contributes to the cosmic battle against evil. The core teachings of Zoroastrianism include:Following the threefold path of Asha: Humata, Hūxta, Huvarshta (lit. 'good thoughts, good words, good deeds').Practicing charity to keep one's soul aligned with Asha and thus with spreading happiness.The spiritual equality and duty of men and women alike.Being good for the sake of goodness and without the hope of reward (see Ashem Vohu).\n\n> - via [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoroastrianism)\n","n":0.04}}},{"i":1373,"$":{"0":{"v":"Zeno's Paradox","n":0.707},"1":{"v":"\n- Areas: [[areas.philosophy]]\n\n---\n\n**Zeno's Paradox**es are a set of philosophical problems generally thought to have been devised by Greek philosopher Zeno of Elea (c. 490–430 BC) to support Parmenides' doctrine that contrary to the evidence of one's senses, the belief in plurality and change is mistaken, and in particular that motion is nothing but an illusion. It is usually assumed, based on Plato's Parmenides (128a–d), that Zeno took on the project of creating these paradoxes because other philosophers had created paradoxes against Parmenides' view. Thus Plato has Zeno say the purpose of the paradoxes \"is to show that their hypothesis that existences are many, if properly followed up, leads to still more absurd results than the hypothesis that they are one.\" Plato has Socrates claim that Zeno and Parmenides were essentially arguing exactly the same point. Some of Zeno's nine surviving paradoxes (preserved in Aristotle's Physicsand Simplicius's commentary thereon) are essentially equivalent to one another. Aristotle offered a refutation of some of them. Three of the strongest and most famous—that of Achilles and the tortoise, the Dichotomy argument, and that of an arrow in flight—are presented in detail below.Zeno's arguments are perhaps the first examples of a method of proof called reductio ad absurdum, also known as proof by contradiction. They are also credited as a source of the dialectic method used by Socrates. Some mathematicians and historians, such as Carl Boyer, hold that Zeno's paradoxes are simply mathematical problems, for which modern calculus provides a mathematical solution. Some philosophers, however, say that Zeno's paradoxes and their variations (see Thomson's lamp) remain relevant metaphysical problems. The origins of the paradoxes are somewhat unclear. Diogenes Laërtius, a fourth source for information about Zeno and his teachings, citing Favorinus, says that Zeno's teacher Parmenides was the first to introduce the paradox of Achilles and the tortoise. But in a later passage, Laërtius attributes the origin of the paradox to Zeno, explaining that Favorinus disagrees.\n\n> - via [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeno's%20paradoxes)\n","n":0.056}}},{"i":1374,"$":{"0":{"v":"Zeigarnik effect","n":0.707},"1":{"v":"\nNamed after Soviet psychologist Bluma Zeigarnik, in psychology the **Zeigarnik effect** occurs when an activity that has been interrupted may be more readily recalled.

Maybe they are the coworkers we rarely talk with or the neighbor we only say hello to. We all have acquaintances we keep meaning to go out with but never do, and friends we lost touch with years ago. Weak ties are also our former employers or professors and any other associations who have not been promoted to close friends.\n\n## The Strength of Weak Ties\n\nMany twentysomethings have limited themselves to huddling together with like-minded peers. Some are in almost constant contact with the same few people. But while the urban tribe helps us survive, it does not help us thrive.\n\nIn work that predates Facebook by more than twenty-five years, sociologist and Stanford professor Mark Granovetter conducted one of the first and most famous studies of social networks. Granovetter was curious about how networks foster social mobility, about how the people in our lives lead to new opportunities. Surveying workers in a Boston suburb who had recently changed jobs, Granovetter found it wasn’t close friends and family—presumably those most invested in helping—who were the most valuable during the job hunt. Rather, more than three-quarters of new jobs had come from leads from contacts who were seen only “occasionally” or “rarely.” This finding led Granovetter to write a groundbreaking paper titled “The Strength of Weak Ties” about the unique value of people we do not know well.\n\n## Weakness of Strong Ties\n\nRose Coser, called the “weakness of strong ties,” or how our close friends hold us back. Our strong ties feel comfortable and familiar but, other than support, they may have little to offer. They are usually too similar—even too similarly stuck—to provide more than sympathy. They often don’t know any more about jobs or relationships than we do.\n\nWeak ties feel too different or, in some cases, literally too far away to be close friends. But that’s the point. Because they’re not just figures in an already ingrown cluster, weak ties give us access to something fresh. They know things and people that we don’t know. Information and opportunity spread farther and faster through weak ties than through close friends because weak ties have fewer overlapping contacts. Weak ties are like bridges you cannot see all the way across, so there is no telling where they might lead.\n\n---\n\nIt’s not just who and what our ties know that matters. It is how we communicate with them as well. Because close-knit groups of strong ties are usually so similar, they tend to use a simple, encoded way of communicating known as restricted speech. Economical but incomplete, restricted speech relies on in-crowd colloquialisms and shortcuts to say more with less.\n\nBut in-group members share more than slang and vocabulary. They share assumptions about one another and the world. They may have gone to the same schools or have the same ideas about love.\n\nWhatever the particular sources of sameness, hanging out with them can limit who and what we know, how we talk, and ultimately how we think.\n\n**Weak ties, on the other hand,** force us to communicate from a place of difference, to use what is called elaborated speech. Unlike restricted speech, which presupposes similarities between the speaker and the listener, elaborated speech does not presume that the listener thinks in the same way or knows the same information. We need to be more thorough when we talk to weak ties, and this requires more organization and reflection. Whether we are talking about career ideas or our thoughts on love, we have to make our case more fully. In this way, weak ties promote, and sometimes even force, thoughtful growth and change.\n\nMost twentysomethings yearn for a feeling of community, and they cling to their strong ties to feel more connected. Ironically, being enmeshed with a group can actually enhance feelings of alienation, because we—and our tribe—become insular and detached. Over time, our initial feeling of being part of a group becomes a sense of disconnection with the larger world.\n\nTrue interconnectedness rests not on texting best friends at one a.m., but on reaching out to weak ties that make a difference in our lives even though they don’t have to. When weak ties help, the communities around us—even the adult community that twentysomethings are warily in the process of entering—seem less impersonal and impenetrable. Suddenly, the world seems smaller and easier to navigate. The more we know about the way things work, the more we feel a part of things.\n\nSee also: [[archive.The Ben Franklin Effect]]\n","n":0.036}}},{"i":1381,"$":{"0":{"v":"Water Spider","n":0.707},"1":{"v":"\n> \"The water spider is a term that refers to a specific person whose main job is to make sure that materials are supplied to where they are needed.

It is one of the few known cases of animals capable of reverting completely to a sexually immature, colonial stage after having reached sexual maturity as a solitary individual. Others include the jellyfish Laodicea undulata and species of the genus Aurelia.Like most other hydrozoans, T. dohrnii begin their life as tiny, free-swimming larvae known as planulae. As a planula settles down, it gives rise to a colony of polyps that are attached to the sea floor. All the polyps and jellyfish arising from a single planula are genetically identical clones. The polyps form into an extensively branched form, which is not commonly seen in most jellyfish. Jellyfish, also known as medusae, then bud off these polyps and continue their life in a free-swimming form, eventually becoming sexually mature. When sexually mature, they have been known to prey on other jellyfish species at a rapid pace. If the T. dohrnii jellyfish is exposed to environmental stress, physical assault, or is sick or old, it can revert to the polyp stage, forming a new polyp colony. It does this through the cell development process of transdifferentiation, which alters the differentiated state of the cells and transforms them into new types of cells.Theoretically, this process can go on indefinitely, effectively rendering the jellyfish biologically immortal, although in practice individuals can still die. In nature, most Turritopsis dohrnii are likely to succumb to predation or disease in the medusa stage without reverting to the polyp form.The capability of biological immortality with no maximum lifespan makes T. dohrnii an important target of basic biological, aging and pharmaceutical research.The \"immortal jellyfish\" was formerly classified as T. nutricula.\n\n> - via [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turritopsis%20dohrnii)\n","n":0.058}}},{"i":1386,"$":{"0":{"v":"Tsundoku","n":1},"1":{"v":"\n- Areas: [[Japanese]]\n\n---\n\n> **Tsundoku** (Japanese: 積ん読) is acquiring reading materials but letting them pile up in one's home without reading them.

Like most pharmacologically active secondary metabolites of plants, THC is a lipid found in cannabis, assumed to be involved in the plant's evolutionary adaptation, putatively against insect predation, ultraviolet light, and environmental stress.THC, along with its double bond isomers and their stereoisomers, is one of only three cannabinoids scheduled by the UN Convention on Psychotropic Substances (the other two are dimethylheptylpyran and parahexyl). It was listed under Schedule I in 1971, but reclassified to Schedule II in 1991 following a recommendation from the WHO. Based on subsequent studies, the WHO has recommended the reclassification to the less-stringent Schedule III. Cannabis as a plant is scheduled by the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs (Schedule I and IV). It is specifically still listed under Schedule I by US federal law under the Controlled Substances Act for having \"no accepted medical use\" and \"lack of accepted safety\".

THC was first discovered and isolated by Bulgarian-born chemist Raphael Mechoulam in Israel in 1964.

Stockholm Syndrome results from a rather specific set of circumstances, namely the power imbalances contained in hostage-taking, kidnapping, and abusive relationships. Therefore, it is difficult to find a large number of people who experience Stockholm Syndrome to conduct studies with any sort of power. This makes it hard to determine trends in the development and effects of the condition.Emotional bonds may be formed between captors and captives, during intimate time together, but these are generally considered irrational in light of the danger or risk endured by the victims. Stockholm syndrome has never been included in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders or DSM, the standard tool for diagnosis of psychiatric illnesses and disorders in the US, mainly due to the lack of a consistent body of academic research. The syndrome is rare: according to data from the FBI, about 5% of hostage victims show evidence of Stockholm syndrome.This term was first used by the media in 1973 when four hostages were taken during a bank robbery in Stockholm, Sweden. The hostages defended their captors after being released and would not agree to testify in court against them. It was noted that in this case, however, the police were perceived to have acted with little care for the hostages' safety, providing an alternative reason for their unwillingness to testify. Stockholm syndrome is paradoxical because the sympathetic sentiments that captives feel towards their captors are the opposite of the fear and disdain which an onlooker might feel towards the captors.There are four key components that characterize Stockholm syndrome: A hostage's development of positive feelings towards the captorNo previous relationship between hostage and captorA refusal by hostages to cooperate with police and other government authoritiesA hostage's belief in the humanity of the captor, ceasing to perceive them as a threat, when the victim holds the same values as the aggressor.Stockholm syndrome is a \"contested illness\" due to doubt about the legitimacy of the condition. It has also come to describe the reactions of some abuse victims beyond the context of kidnappings or hostage-taking. Actions and attitudes similar to those suffering from Stockholm syndrome have also been found in victims of sexual abuse, human trafficking, extremism, terrorism, economic oppression, financial repression, political repression and religious persecution. This is because Stockholm syndrome can be argued as \"another method of coping with the stress and danger...similar to some forms of coping in that the participants do not directly address the problem but find a way to cope with the situation by identifying with the aggressor. Coping mechanisms such as these can have a large impact on PTSD.\"Helsinki syndrome is a term sometimes used incorrectly instead of Stockholm syndrome. The confusion is often deliberate and used for ironic effect. It originates in the substitution of one Nordic capital (Stockholm, Sweden) for another (Helsinki, Finland).

Classical Scythians dominated the Pontic steppe from approximately the 7th century BC until the 3rd century BC. They can also be referred to as Pontic Scythians. They were part of the wider Scythian cultures, stretching across the Eurasian Steppe. In a broader sense, Scythians has also been used to designate all early Eurasian nomads, although the validity of such terminology is controversial. According to Di Cosmo, other terms such as \"Early nomadic\" would be preferable. Eastern members of the Scythian cultures are often specifically designated as Sakas.The Scythians are generally believed to have been of Iranian origin; they spoke a language of the Scythian branch of the Iranian languages, and practiced a variant of ancient Iranian religion. Among the earliest peoples to master mounted warfare, the Scythians replaced the Cimmerians as the dominant power on the Pontic steppe in the 8th century BC. During this time they and related peoples came to dominate the entire Eurasian Steppe from the Carpathian Mountains in the west to Ordos Plateau in the east, creating what has been called the first Central Asian nomadic empire. Based in what is modern-day Ukraine and southern Russia, they called themselves Scoloti (Ancient Greek: Σκώλοτοι Skṓlotoi) and were led by a nomadic warrior aristocracy known as the Royal Scythians.In the 7th century BC, the Scythians crossed the Caucasus and frequently raided the Middle East along with the Cimmerians, playing an important role in the political developments of the region. Around 650–630 BC, Scythians briefly dominated the Medes of the western Iranian Plateau, stretching their power to the borders of Egypt. After losing control over Media, they continued intervening in Middle Eastern affairs, playing a leading role in the destruction of the Assyrian Empire in the Sack of Nineveh in 612 BC. The Scythians subsequently engaged in frequent conflicts with the Achaemenid Empire, and suffered a major defeat against Macedonia in the 4th century BC and were subsequently gradually conquered by the Sarmatians, a related Iranian people living to their west. In the late 2nd century BC, their capital at Scythian Neapolis in the Crimea was captured by Mithridates VI and their territories incorporated into the Bosporan Kingdom. By this time they had been largely Hellenized. By the 3rd century AD, the Sarmatians and last remnants of the Scythians were dominated by the Alans, and were being overwhelmed by the Goths. By the early Middle Ages, the Scythians and the Sarmatians had been largely assimilated and absorbed by early Slavs. The Scythians were instrumental in the ethnogenesis of the Ossetians, who are believed to be descended from the Alans.The Scythians played an important part in the Silk Road, a vast trade network connecting Greece, Persia, India and China, perhaps contributing to the prosperity of those civilisations. Settled metalworkers made portable decorative objects for the Scythians, forming a history of Scythian metalworking. These objects survive mainly in metal, forming a distinctive Scythian art.The name of the Scythians survived in the region of Scythia. Early authors continued to use the term \"Scythian\", applying it to many groups unrelated to the original Scythians, such as Huns, Goths, Turkic peoples, Avars, Bulgars, Khazars, and other unnamed nomads. The scientific study of the Scythians is called Scythology.\n\n> - via [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scythians)\n","n":0.04}}},{"i":1428,"$":{"0":{"v":"Scandinavian mile","n":0.707},"1":{"v":"\nA **Scandinavian mile** (Norwegian and Swedish: mil, [miːl], like \"meal\") is a unit of length common in Norway and Sweden, but not Denmark.

Named after the House of Sasan, it endured for over four centuries, from 224 to 651 AD, making it the longest-lived Persian imperial dynasty. The **Sasanian Empire** succeeded the Parthian Empire, and re-established the Persians as a major power in late antiquity alongside its neighbouring arch-rival, the Roman Empire (after 395 the Byzantine Empire).The empire was founded by Ardashir I, an Iranian ruler who rose to power as Parthia weakened from internal strife and wars with the Romans. After defeating the last Parthian shahanshah, Artabanus IV, at the Battle of Hormozdgan in 224, he established the Sasanian dynasty and set out to restore the legacy of the Achaemenid Empire by expanding Iran's dominions. At its greatest territorial extent, the Sasanian Empire encompassed all of present-day Iran and Iraq, and stretched from the eastern Mediterranean (including Anatolia and Egypt) to parts of modern-day Pakistan as well as from parts of southern Arabia to the Caucasus and Central Asia. According to legend, the vexilloid of the Sasanian Empire was the Derafsh Kaviani.The period of Sasanian rule is considered to be a high point in Iranian history and in many ways was the peak of ancient Iranian culture before the conquest by Arab Muslims under the Rashidun Caliphate and subsequent Islamization of Iran. The Sasanians tolerated the varied faiths and cultures of their subjects, developed a complex and centralized government bureaucracy, and revitalized Zoroastrianism as a legitimizing and unifying force of their rule. They also built grand monuments, public works, and patronized cultural and educational institutions. The empire's cultural influence extended far beyond its territorial borders—including Western Europe, Africa, China, and India—and helped shape European and Asian medieval art.

It refers to the emotional flavors/essence crafted into the work by the writer and relished by a 'sensitive spectator' or sahṛdaya, literally one who \"has heart\", and can connect to the work with emotion, without dryness.Rasas are created by bhavas: the state of mind.The rasa theory has a dedicated section (Chapter 6) in the Sanskrit text Natya Shastra, an ancient text on the arts from the 1st millennium BCE attributed to Bharata Muni. However, its most complete exposition in drama, songs and other performance arts is found in the works of the Kashmiri Shaivite philosopher Abhinavagupta (c. 1000 CE), demonstrating the persistence of a long-standing aesthetic tradition of ancient India. According to the Rasa theory of the Natya Shastra, entertainment is a desired effect of performance arts but not the primary goal, and the primary goal is to transport the audience into another parallel reality, full of wonder and bliss, where they experience the essence of their own consciousness, and reflect on spiritual and moral questions.Although the concept of rasa is fundamental to many forms of Indian arts including dance, music, theatre, painting, sculpture, and literature, the interpretation and implementation of a particular rasa differs between different styles and schools.

Phenomenological theories of literature regard works of art as mediators between the consciousnesses of the author and the reader or as attempts to disclose aspects of the being of humans and their worlds.

Husserl proposes that reflection put out of play all unprovable assumptions (about the existence of objects, for example, or about ideal or metaphysical entities) and describe what is given in experience.

Philosophers should \"bracket\" the object-world and, in a process he calls epoché, or \"reduction,\" focus their attention on what is immanent in consciousness itself, without presupposing anything about its origins or supports.

Ojibwe is one of the largest Native American languages north of Mexico in terms of number of speakers and is characterized by a series of dialects, some of which differ significantly. The dialects of Ojibwe are spoken in Canada from southwestern Quebec, through Ontario, Manitoba and parts of Saskatchewan, with outlying communities in Alberta and British Columbia, and in the United States from Michigan through Wisconsin and Minnesota, with a number of communities in North Dakota and Montana, as well as migrant groups in Kansas and Oklahoma.The absence of linguistic or political unity among Ojibwe-speaking groups is associated with the relative autonomy of the regional dialects of Ojibwe. There is no single dialect that is considered the most prestigious or most prominent, and no standard writing system used to represent all dialects. Ojibwe dialects have been written in numerous ways over a period of several centuries, with the development of different written traditions reflecting a range of influences from the orthographic practices of other languages.Writing systems associated with particular dialects have been developed by adapting the Latin script, usually the English or French orthographies. A widely used Roman character-based writing system is the double vowel system, attributed to Charles Fiero. The double vowel system is quickly gaining popularity among language teachers in the United States and Canada because of its ease of use.A syllabic writing system not related to English or French writing is used by some Ojibwe speakers in northern Ontario and Manitoba. Development of the original form of Canadian Aboriginal syllabics is credited to missionary James Evans around 1840.The Great Lakes Algonquian syllabics are based on French orthography with letters organized into syllables. It was primarily used by speakers of Fox, Potawatomi, and Winnebago, but there is indirect evidence of use by speakers of Chippewa (\"Southwestern Ojibwe\").\n\n> - via [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ojibwe%20writing%20systems)\n","n":0.056}}},{"i":1467,"$":{"0":{"v":"Octane rating","n":0.707},"1":{"v":"\n- Areas: [[Chemistry]], [[Physics]]\n\n---\nAn **Octane rating**, or octane number, is a standard measure of a fuel's ability to withstand compression in an internal combustion engine without detonating. The higher the octane number, the more compression the fuel can withstand before detonating. Octane rating does not relate directly to the power output or the energy content of the fuel per unit mass or volume, but simply indicates gasoline's capability against compression. \n\nWhether or not a higher octane fuel improves or impairs an engine's performance depends on the design of the engine. In broad terms, fuels with a higher octane rating are used in higher-compression gasoline engines, which may yield higher power for these engines. Such higher power comes from the fuel's higher compression by the engine design, and not directly from the gasoline.\n\nIn contrast, fuels with lower octane (but higher cetane numbers) are ideal for diesel engines because diesel engines (also called compression-ignition engines) do not compress the fuel, but rather compress only air and then inject fuel into the air that was heated by compression. Gasoline engines rely on ignition of air and fuel compressed together as a mixture, which is ignited near the end of the compression stroke by electric spark plugs. Therefore, high compressibility of the fuel matters mainly for gasoline engines. Using gasoline with lower octane may cause engine knocking (pre-ignition).\n\nThe octane rating of aviation gasoline was extremely important in determining aero engine performance in the aircraft of World War II. The octane rating alone did not only determine the performance of the gasoline, but also the versatility of the fuel in handling a range of lean to rich operating conditions. \n> - via [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octane%20rating)\n","n":0.06}}},{"i":1468,"$":{"0":{"v":"Oblique Strategies","n":0.707},"1":{"v":"\n- Areas: [[areas.music]]\n\n---\n\n> **Oblique Strategies** (subtitled Over One Hundred Worthwhile Dilemmas) is a card-based method for promoting creativity jointly created by musician/artist Brian Eno and multimedia artist Peter Schmidt, first published in 1975.

When gasping, a baby may inhale amniotic fluid and any meconium in it.\n\nBabies are more likely to pass meconium when:\n\n- They've had a long or hard delivery.\n- They are born past their due date.\n- The mother has a health problem, like [diabetes](https://kidshealth.org/en/parents/gestational-diabetes.html) or [high blood pressure](https://kidshealth.org/en/parents/hypertension.html).\n- The mother [smoked](https://kidshealth.org/en/parents/preg-smoking.html) or used drugs during the pregnancy.\n- They [didn't grow well](https://kidshealth.org/en/parents/iugr.html) before birth.\n","n":0.073}}},{"i":1495,"$":{"0":{"v":"Maya (religion)","n":0.707},"1":{"v":"\n- Areas: [[areas.hinduism]]\n\n---\n\nMaya (; Devanagari: माया, IAST: māyā), literally \"illusion\" or \"magic\", has multiple meanings in Indian philosophies depending on the context.

De Bono cites the Judgment of Solomon as an example of lateral thinking, where King Solomon resolves a dispute over the parentage of a child by calling for the child to be cut in half, and making his judgment according to the reactions that this order receives. Edward de Bono also links lateral thinking with humour, arguing it entails a switch-over from a familiar pattern to a new, unexpected one.

This smoking is accomplished either as a cold smoke of the raw leaves as they are processed or as a hot smoke of previously processed (withered and oxidized) leaves. The intensity of the smoke aroma can be varied by locating the leaves closer or farther (or higher or lower in a multi-level facility) from the source of heat and smoke or by adjusting the duration of the process. The flavour and aroma of lapsang souchong is described as containing empyreumatic notes, including wood smoke, pine resin, smoked paprika, and dried longan; it may be mixed with milk but is not bitter and usually not sweetened with sugar. The tea originates from the Wuyi Mountains region of Fujian, China and is considered a Wuyi tea (or bohea). It is also produced in Taiwan (Formosa). It has been labelled as smoked tea (熏茶), Zheng Shan Xiao Zhong, smoky souchong, tarry lapsang souchong, and lapsang souchong crocodile. While the tea leaf grading system adopted the term souchong to refer to a particular leaf position, lapsang souchong may be made with any leaf of the Camellia sinensis plant, though it is not unusual for the lower leaves, which are larger and less flavourful, to be used as the smoking compensates for the lower flavour profile and the higher leaves are more valuable for use in unflavoured or unblended teas.

Still other scriptures narrate that Kamadhenu was in the possession of either Jamadagni or Vashista (both ancient sages), and that kings who tried to steal her from the sage ultimately faced dire consequences for their actions. Kamadhenu plays the important role of providing milk and milk products to be used in her sage-master's oblations; she is also capable of producing fierce warriors to protect him.

From ancient times, landscapes and bodies of water were thought to direct the flow of the universal Qi – “cosmic current” or energy – through places and structures. Because Qi has the same patterns as wind and water, a specialist who understands them can affect these flows to improve wealth, happiness, long life, and family; on the other hand, the wrong flow of Qi brings bad results. More broadly, feng shui includes astronomical, astrological, architectural, cosmological, geographical, and topographical dimensions. Historically, as well as in many parts of the contemporary Chinese world, feng shui was used to orient buildings and spiritually significant structures such as tombs, as well as dwellings and other structures. One scholar writes that in contemporary Western societies, however, “feng shui tends to be reduced to interior design for health and wealth. It has become increasingly visible through 'feng shui consultants' and corporate architects, who charge large sums of money for their analysis, advice, and design.”Feng shui has been identified as both non-scientific and pseudoscientific by scientists and philosophers, and has been described as a paradigmatic example of pseudoscience. It exhibits a number of classic pseudoscientific aspects, such as making claims about the functioning of the world which are not amenable to testing with the scientific method.

On 5 April, the British government dispatched a naval task force to engage the Argentine Navy and Air Force before making an amphibious assault on the islands. The conflict lasted 74 days and ended with an Argentine surrender on 14 June, returning the islands to British control. In total, 649 Argentine military personnel, 255 British military personnel, and three Falkland Islanders died during the hostilities.The conflict was a major episode in the protracted dispute over the territories' sovereignty. Argentina asserted (and maintains) that the islands are Argentine territory, and the Argentine government thus characterised its military action as the reclamation of its own territory. The British government regarded the action as an invasion of a territory that had been a Crown colony since 1841. Falkland Islanders, who have inhabited the islands since the early 19th century, are predominantly descendants of British settlers, and strongly favour British sovereignty. Neither state officially declared war, although both governments declared the Islands a war zone.The conflict has had a strong effect in both countries and has been the subject of various books, articles, films, and songs. Patriotic sentiment ran high in Argentina, but the unfavourable outcome prompted large protests against the ruling military government, hastening its downfall and the democratisation of the country. In the United Kingdom, the Conservative government, bolstered by the successful outcome, was re-elected with an increased majority the following year. The cultural and political effect of the conflict has been less in the UK than in Argentina, where it has remained a common topic for discussion.Diplomatic relations between the United Kingdom and Argentina were restored in 1989 following a meeting in Madrid, at which the two governments issued a joint statement. No change in either country's position regarding the sovereignty of the Falkland Islands was made explicit. In 1994, Argentina adopted a new Constitution, which declared the Falkland Islands as part of one of its provinces by law.

Over the millennia since, they have performed a wide variety of functions in many different cultures: courtiers or equivalent domestics, for espionage or clandestine operations, castrato singers, concubines, or sexual partners, religious specialists, soldiers, royal guards, government officials, and guardians of women or harem servants.Eunuchs would usually be servants or slaves who had been castrated to make them less threatening servants of a royal court where physical access to the ruler could wield great influence. Seemingly lowly domestic functions—such as making the ruler's bed, bathing him, cutting his hair, carrying him in his litter, or even relaying messages—could, in theory, give a eunuch \"the ruler's ear\" and impart de facto power on the formally humble but trusted servant. Similar instances are reflected in the humble origins and etymology of many high offices.Eunuchs supposedly did not generally have loyalties to the military, the aristocracy, or a family of their own (having neither offspring nor in-laws, at the very least).

Every cell interacts with its eight _[neighbours](/wiki/Moore_neighborhood)_, which are the cells that are horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent. At each step in time, the following transitions occur:\n\n1.  Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.\n2.  Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.\n3.  Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.\n4.  Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.\n\nThese rules, which compare the behavior of the automaton to real life, can be condensed into the following:\n\n1.  Any live cell with two or three live neighbours survives.\n2.  Any dead cell with three live neighbours becomes a live cell.\n3.  All other live cells die in the next generation. Similarly, all other dead cells stay dead.\n\nThe initial pattern constitutes the _seed_ of the system. The first generation is created by applying the above rules simultaneously to every cell in the seed, live or dead; births and deaths occur simultaneously, and the discrete moment at which this happens is sometimes called a _tick_. Each generation is a _[pure function](/wiki/Pure_function)_ of the preceding one.

He is traditionally regarded as the inventor of paper and the modern papermaking process. Although early forms of paper had existed since the 3rd century BCE, he occupies a pivotal place in the history of paper due to his addition of tree bark and hemp ends, which resulted in the large-scale manufacture and worldwide spread of paper.Born in Guiyang Commandery (in what is now Leiyang), Cai arrived at the imperial court in Luoyang by 75 CE, where he served as a chamberlain for Emperor Ming, and then as Xiao Huangmen, an imperial messenger for Emperor Zhang. To assist Lady Dou in securing her adopted son as designated heir, he interrogated Consort Song and her sister, who then killed themselves. When Emperor He ascended the throne in 88 CE, Dou awarded Cai with two positions: Zhongchang shi, a political counselor to the emperor that was the highest position for eunuchs of the time, and also as Shangfang Ling, where Cai oversaw the production of instruments and weapons at the Palace Workshop.Despite Emperor He's successful coup d'état against the Dou family in 92 CE, Cai was undisturbed by his former ally's downfall. His position in the Palace Workshop increased in scope; he became responsible for the production of ceremonial weapons, which the Hou Hanshu reports were of exemplary craftsmanship. However, Cai's most noted innovation was in 105 CE, when he substantially improved the papermaking process with the use of tree bark, hemp waste, old rags, and fishnets. His new type of paper quickly displaced the bamboo and wooden slips used until then, and Cai received wealth and fame throughout the empire. In 110 CE, Lady Deng, who had become the empress dowager to the young Emperor An, appointed Cai to oversee 100 scholars' new edition of the Five Classics. Cai was rewarded for his imperial service in 114 CE; he received the title of marquis, and was enfeoffed lord of Longting, a small village. When his ally Deng died in 121 CE, Cai was ordered to the Ministry of Justice because of his involvement in the death of the emperor's grandmother, Consort Song. Ashamed at his predicament and expecting to be sentenced to death, he committed suicide that year and died in the capital city in which he had spent almost his entire adult life.Cai's improvements to paper-making are considered to have had an enormous impact on human history, and of those who created China's Four Great Inventions—the compass, gunpowder, papermaking and printing—Cai is the only inventor whose name is known. Although in China he is revered in ancestor worship, deified as the god of papermaking, and appears in Chinese folklore, he is mostly unknown outside of East Asia.

The CNS includes the brain and spinal cord. The PNS includes the nerves outside the CNS; they are in the rest (the periphery) of the body. The basic building blocks of the nervous system are nerves, neurons, and neu- rotransmitters and glial cells.\n\nNeurochemical electrical changes throughout the nervous system serve as a basic mechanism for psychological functions.Because these electrical changes involve the movement of chemical ions, the transmission system is called an electrochemical system.\n\nNeurotransmitters are chemicals that play a critical role in transmitting signals between neurons. The glial cells are cells within the nervous system that plays a variety of support roles for the neurons; they protect neurons from damage, repair them when they are damaged, and remove damaged or dead tissue when it can’t be repaired\n\nSome scientists propose that the biological study of the brain is really the study of neurons in networks. This approach is known as the neurocomputational approach to brain functioning. It’s “computational” because these researchers base their models of brain function- ing on the calculation processes of neurons in networks as they interact with each other by turning each other on and off with electrochemical signaling.\n\nScientists look at the nervous system in two basic ways: anatomical organization and functional organization. Looking at the nervous system from an anatomical (or anatomy) viewpoint essentially focuses on the parts, and the functional organization view is concerned with what those parts do with respect to mental processes and behavior.\n\nA neuron is considered the information cell; it’s involved in the processing and storage of information. Neurons contain the following parts:\n\n- Soma: The cell body of the neuron containing the nucleus and supportive structures of the cell, including the mitochondria\n- Dendrite: Projections from the cell body that receive information from other neurons\n- Axon: The nerve fiber that conducts the electrical impulse\n- Terminal button: The end of the axon involved in neurotransmitter release and signaling to other neurons\n\nwhen information from the environment (or inside the brain itself from other neurons) comes into the brain through the sensory organs and activates a particular neuron (or, more often, a set of neurons), an action potential is created.\n\nAction potentials are the movement of electrochemical energy through a neuron toward its terminal button, toward other neurons. Something called the all-or-none law states that neurons are either “on” or “off”; they are either firing an action potential or not. After a neuron is activated, it fires. If it’s not activated: no action, no fire! It’s electrochemical.\n\nWhen a neuron is not firing, it is considered to be in the state of a resting potential and its electrical charge is more negative on the inside relative to the outside.\n\nWhen a neuron receives a signal from another neuron, gates in the cell membrane (its covering) open and positive ions rush into the negatively charged inside of the cell. When the action potential occurs, the cell cannot fire again for a short period of time. During this refractory period, small pumps in the cell membrane work to reset the neuron by moving positive ions back out of the cell, returning the chemical balance of the neuron to its original state to prepare for another round of action.\n\nNeurons don’t actually connect to each other in a physical sense. There are gaps between them known as synapse, spaces between axon terminals of one neuron (the neuron sending the signal) and the dendrites of the next neuron (the neuron receiving the signal); this is where inter-neuronal ­communication happens through chemical messengers called neurotransmitters. Although they are only millionths of an inch apart, the sending neuron throws its “message in a bottle” into the synapse, where it drifts to the other shore (the receiving dendrite).\n\nNeurotransmitters are stored in the axon of the sending cell. An action potential stimulates their release into the synapse. They travel (actually drift) to a receiving neuron in which specialized docks known as receptor sites are present. Different shaped neurotransmitters have different docks.\n\nBasically, neurotransmitters have one of two effects; they either excite the receiving neuron (make it more likely to fire) or inhibit the receiving neuron (make it less likely to fire). Some neurotransmitters are excitatory and some are inhibitory. Whether a particular neuron fires (transmits a signal) depends on the balance between excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters.\n\nScientists have discovered more than 100 neurotransmitters in the human brain.\nMany, including the following, play a major role:\n\n- [[archive.Glutamate]]: The most common excitatory neurotransmitter\n- GABA: The most common inhibitory transmitter; involved in eating, aggression, and sleep\n- Acetylcholine: A common neurotransmitter with multiple excitatory and inhibitory functions; involved in movement and memory\n\nAnother group of four chemically similar neurotransmitters modify behavior in many ways. These neurotransmitters are particularly important regarding psychological disorders:\n\n- Serotonin: An inhibitory transmitter that is involved in balancing excitatory transmitters as well as mood, sleep, eating, and pain\n- Dopamine: Can be either inhibitory or excitatory and is implicated in attention, pleasure and reward, and movement\n- Epinephrine: An excitatory transmitter related to stress responses, heart rate,\n  and blood pressure\n- Norepinephrine: An excitatory transmitter involved in energy regulation, anxiety, and fear\n\nFollowing the docking process, neurotransmitters are either broken down by enzymes or reabsorbed by the sending neurons in a process called reuptake. These two processes clear neurotransmitters from the synapse after they have done their job\n\nNeurotransmitter manipulation is a primary mechanism of action for most psychiatric medications.\n\nAn estimated 86 billion neurons live in the human brain and form trillions of connections among themselves.\n\nThe brain is a “massively parallel” information-processing system. If each neuron was connected to only one other neuron, the neuron system would be considered “massively serial.” Compared to electronic signals, neural signals travel very slowly (like 5–100 mph), so it is efficient to do many things at once — called [[devlog.parallel processing]].\n\nNot every neuron is connected to every other neuron, but neurons are connected to multiple others that form clusters or networks involved in particular psychological processes and behaviors.\n","n":0.032}}},{"i":1605,"$":{"0":{"v":"Bodh Gaya","n":0.707},"1":{"v":"\n- Areas: [[areas.buddhism]]\n\n---\n\n**Bodh Gaya** is a religious site and place of pilgrimage associated with the Mahabodhi Temple Complex in Gaya district in the Indian state of Bihar.

The principal text in the liturgical group is the Yasna, which takes its name from the Yasna ceremony, Zoroastrianism's primary act of worship, and at which the Yasna text is recited. The most important portion of the Yasna texts are the five Gathas, consisting of seventeen hymns attributed to Zoroaster himself. These hymns, together with five other short Old Avestan texts that are also part of the Yasna, are in the Old (or 'Gathic') Avestan language. The remainder of the Yasna's texts are in Younger Avestan, which is not only from a later stage of the language, but also from a different geographic region.Extensions to the Yasna ceremony include the texts of the Vendidad and the Visperad. The Visperad extensions consist mainly of additional invocations of the divinities (yazatas), while the Vendidad is a mixed collection of prose texts mostly dealing with purity laws. Even today, the Vendidad is the only liturgical text that is not recited entirely from memory. Some of the materials of the extended Yasna are from the Yashts, which are hymns to the individual yazatas. Unlike the Yasna, Visperad and Vendidad, the Yashts and the other lesser texts of the Avesta are no longer used liturgically in high rituals. Aside from the Yashts, these other lesser texts include the Nyayesh texts, the Gah texts, the Siroza, and various other fragments. Together, these lesser texts are conventionally called Khordeh Avesta or \"Little Avesta\" texts. When the first Khordeh Avesta editions were printed in the 19th century, these texts (together with some non-Avestan language prayers) became a book of common prayer for lay people.The term Avesta is from the 9th/10th-century works of Zoroastrian tradition in which the word appears as Zoroastrian Middle Persian abestāg, Book Pahlavi ʾp(y)stʾkʼ. In that context, abestāg texts are portrayed as received knowledge, and are distinguished from the exegetical commentaries (the zand) thereof. The literal meaning of the word abestāg is uncertain; it is generally acknowledged to be a learned borrowing from Avestan, but none of the suggested etymologies have been universally accepted. The widely repeated derivation from \\*upa-stavaka is from Christian Bartholomae (Altiranisches Wörterbuch, 1904), who interpreted abestāg as a descendant of a hypothetical reconstructed Old Iranian word for \"praise-song\" (Bartholomae: Lobgesang); but this word is not actually attested in any text.\n\n> - via [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avesta)\n","n":0.049}}},{"i":1613,"$":{"0":{"v":"ATM Inventor","n":0.707},"1":{"v":"\n- Areas: [[areas.Money]]\n\n---\n\nA hospital in Meghalaya, where ATM inventor John Adrian Shepherd-Barron was born in 1925, has got an automated teller machine after 53 years.

The style responded to leading 19-century theoreticians, such as French architect Eugène-Emmanuel Viollet-le-Duc (1814–1879) and British art critic John Ruskin (1819–1900). In Britain, it was influenced by William Morris and the Arts and Crafts movement. German architects and designers sought a spiritually uplifting Gesamtkunstwerk (\"total work of art\") that would unify the architecture, furnishings, and art in the interior in a common style, to uplift and inspire the residents.\n\nThe first Art Nouveau houses and interior decoration appeared in Brussels in the 1890s, in the architecture and interior design of houses designed by Paul Hankar, Henry van de Velde, and especially Victor Horta, whose Hôtel Tassel was completed in 1893. It moved quickly to Paris, where it was adapted by Hector Guimard, who saw Horta's work in Brussels and applied the style for the entrances of the new Paris Métro. It reached its peak at the 1900 Paris International Exposition, which introduced the Art Nouveau work of artists such as Louis Tiffany. It appeared in graphic arts in the posters of Alphonse Mucha, and the glassware of René Lalique and Émile Gallé.\n\nFrom Belgium and France, it spread to the rest of Europe, taking on different names and characteristics in each country (see Naming section below). It often appeared not only in capitals, but also in rapidly growing cities that wanted to establish artistic identities (Turin and Palermo in Italy; Glasgow in Scotland; Munich and Darmstadt in Germany), as well as in centres of independence movements (Helsinki in Finland, then part of the Russian Empire; Barcelona in Catalonia, Spain).By 1914, and with the beginning of the First World War, Art Nouveau was largely exhausted. In the 1920s, it was replaced as the dominant architectural and decorative art style by Art Deco and then Modernism. The Art Nouveau style began to receive more positive attention from critics in the late 1960s, with a major exhibition of the work of Hector Guimard at the Museum of Modern Art in 1970.\n\n> - via [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art%20Nouveau)\n","n":0.044}}},{"i":1618,"$":{"0":{"v":"Arameans","n":1},"1":{"v":"\n- Areas: [[areas.History]]\n\n---\n\nThe **Arameans** (Old Aramaic: 𐤀𐤓𐤌𐤉𐤀; Greek: Ἀραμαῖοι; Syriac: ܐܪ̈ܡܝܐ / Ārāmāyē) were an ancient Semitic-speaking people in the Near East, first recorded in historical sources from the late 12th century BCE. The Aramean homeland was known as the land of Aram, encompassing central regions of modern Syria. At the beginning of the 1st millennium BCE, a number of Aramean states were established throughout the western regions of the ancient Near East. The most notable among them was the Kingdom of Aram-Damascus, that reached its height in the second half of the 9th century BCE, during the reign of king Hazael. A distinctive Aramaic alphabet was also developed and used for writing in the Old Aramaic language.During the 8th century BCE, local Aramean kingdoms were gradually conquered by the Neo-Assyrian Empire. Policy of population displacement and relocation, that was applied throughout Assyrian domains, also affected Arameans, many of whom were resettled by Assyrian authorities. As a result of a wider dispersion of Aramean communities throughout various regions of the Near East, the speaking area of Aramaic language was also widened, gradually gaining significance and eventually becoming the common language of public life and administration, particularly during the periods of Neo-Babylonian Empire (612–539), and later Achaemenid Empire (539–330). As a result of linguistic aramization, a wider Aramaic-speaking area was created throughout the central regions of the Near East, exceeding the boundaries of Aramean ethnic communities. During the later Hellenistic and Roman periods, minor Aramean states emerged, most notable of them being the Kingdom of Osroene, centered in Edessa, the birthplace of Edessan Aramaic, that later came to be known as Classical Syriac language.From the 1st century CE onward, the process of Christianization was initiated throughout the ancient Near East, encompassing various Aramaic-speaking communities, including Arameans, thus resulting in the creation of Aramean Christianity, represented by prominent Christian leaders and authors, who created their theological and literary works in Aramaic language, most notable of them being saint Ephrem of Edessa (d. 373). In the following period, two consecutive processes have affected Christian Arameans. First process was initiated during the 5th century, when ancient Greek custom of using Syrian/Syriac labels for Arameans and their language, started to gain acceptance among Aramean literary and ecclesiastical elites. Second process was initiated after the Arab conquest in the 7th century, that was followed by Islamization and gradual Arabization of Aramean communities throughout the Near East, ultimately resulting in their fragmentation and acculturation. Remaining communities of Christian Arameans continued to decline throughout the medieval period, divided internally along denominational lines, with majority adhering to Oriental Orthodoxy and thus belonging to the ecclesiastical jurisdiction of the Oriental Orthodox Patriarchate of Antioch, that later came to be known as the Syriac Orthodox Church.During the Early Modern period, studies of Aramaic languages (both ancient and modern) were initiated among western scholars, thus leading to the formation of Aramaic studies as a wider multidisciplinary field, that also includes the study of cultural and historical heritage of Arameans. Linguistic and historical aspects of Aramean studies were widened, since the 19th century, by archaeological excavations of ancient Aramean sites in various regions of the Near East.\n\n> - via [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arameans)\n","n":0.044}}},{"i":1619,"$":{"0":{"v":"Aramaic","n":1},"1":{"v":"\n- Areas: [[areas.linguistics]], [[areas.History]]\n\n---\n\n**Aramaic** (Classical Syriac: ܐܪܡܝܐ Arāmāyā; Old Aramaic: 𐤀𐤓𐤌𐤉𐤀; Imperial Aramaic: 𐡀𐡓𐡌𐡉𐡀; square script אַרָמָיָא) is a Semitic language that originated among the Arameans in the ancient region of Syria. Over three thousand years, Aramaic served as a language of public life and administration of ancient kingdoms and empires and also as a language of divine worship and religious study. Several dialects are still spoken today. It subsequently branched into several Neo-Aramaic languages that are more widely spoken in modern times.The Aramaic language belongs to the Northwest group of the Semitic language family, which also includes the Canaanite languages, such as Hebrew, Edomite, Moabite, and Phoenician, as well as Amorite and Ugaritic. Aramaic languages are written in the Aramaic alphabet, a descendant of the Phoenician alphabet, and the most prominent alphabet variant is the Syriac alphabet. The Aramaic alphabet also became a base for the creation and adaptation of specific writing systems in some other Semitic languages, such as the Hebrew alphabet and the Arabic alphabet.The Aramaic languages are now considered endangered, since several dialects are used mainly by the older generations. However, researchers are working to record and analyze all of the remaining dialects of Neo-Aramaic languages before they cease to be spoken languages.

An earlier test, known as the AZ test, was developed by Selmar Aschheim and Bernhard Zondek. When urine from a woman in the early months of pregnancy was injected into immature female mice, their ovaries would enlarge and show follicular maturation. The test was considered reliable, with an error rate of less than 2%. Friedman and Lapham's test was essentially identical, but replaced the mouse with a rabbit. A few days after the injection, the animal would be dissected and the size of her ovaries examined.\n\nThe rabbit test became a widely used bioassay (animal-based test) to test for pregnancy. The term \"rabbit test\" was first recorded in 1949, and was the origin of a common euphemism, \"the rabbit died,\" for a positive pregnancy test. The phrase was, in fact, based on a common misconception about the test. While many people assumed that the injected rabbit would die only if the woman was pregnant, in fact all rabbits used for the test died, as they had to be surgically opened in order to examine the ovaries.\n\nA later alternative to the rabbit test, known as the \"Hogben test,\" used the African clawed frog, and yielded results without the need to cut the animal open. Modern pregnancy tests continue to operate on the basis of testing for the presence of the hormone hCG in the blood or urine, but no longer require the use of a live animal.\n\nVia - [Rabbit test - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabbit_test)\n","n":0.058}}},{"i":1652,"$":{"0":{"v":"Psilocybe cubensis","n":0.707},"1":{"v":"\n- Areas: [[areas.psychonautics]]\n\n---\n\n> Psilocybe cubensis is a species of psychedelic mushroom whose principal active compounds are psilocybin and psilocin.

Northcote Parkinson's 1957 argument that people within an organization commonly or typically give disproportionate weight to trivial issues. Parkinson provides the example of a fictional committee whose job was to approve the plans for a nuclear power plant spending the majority of its time on discussions about relatively minor but easy-to-grasp issues, such as what materials to use for the staff bicycle shed, while neglecting the proposed design of the plant itself, which is far more important and a far more difficult and complex task.\n\nThe law has been applied to software development and other activities. The terms bicycle-shed effect, bike-shed effect, and bike-shedding were coined based on Parkinson's example; it was popularised in the Berkeley Software Distribution community by the Danish software developer Poul-Henning Kamp in 1999 and, due to that, has since become popular within the field of software development generally.\n\n## Argument\n\nThe concept was first presented as a corollary of his broader \"Parkinson's law\" spoof of management. He dramatizes this \"law of triviality\" with the example of a committee's deliberations on an atomic reactor, contrasting it to deliberations on a bicycle shed. As he put it: \"The time spent on any item of the agenda will be in inverse proportion to the sum [of money] involved.\" A reactor is so vastly expensive and complicated that an average person cannot understand it (see [[archive.ambiguity aversion]]), so one assumes that those who work on it understand it. However, everyone can visualize a cheap, simple bicycle shed, so planning one can result in endless discussions because everyone involved wants to implement their own proposal and demonstrate personal contribution.\n\nAfter a suggestion of building something new for the community, like a bike shed, problems arise when everyone involved argues about the details. This is a metaphor indicating that it is not necessary to argue about every little feature based simply on having the knowledge to do so. Some people have commented that the amount of noise generated by a change is inversely proportional to the complexity of the change.\n\nThe law of triviality is supported by behavioural research. People tend to spend more time on small decisions than they should, and less time on big decisions than they should. A simple explanation is that during the process of making a decision, one has to assess whether enough information has been collected to make the decision. If people make mistakes about whether they have enough information, they will tend to stop too early for big decisions. The reason is that big decisions require collecting information for a long time. It leaves more time to make a mistake (and stop) before getting enough information. Conversely, for small decisions, where people should stop early, they may continue to ponder for too long by mistake.\n","n":0.046}}},{"i":1663,"$":{"0":{"v":"LSD","n":1},"1":{"v":"\n- Areas: [[areas.psychonautics]]\n\n---\n\nLysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) is a classical hallucinogen originally synthesized by Albert Hoffman.

Traditionally, hunters would participate in the ritual to heighten their senses and stamina before a hunt.\n\nKambo is a poison.

The mixture most often comprises a blend of psychotria viridis (aka chacruna), which contains DMT, and Baniseriopsis Caapi, which contains a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAO-I).\n\nThis smokeable blend was spearheaded by Australian psychonaut Julian Palmer in the early noughties, and was used as an alternative to crystallised DMT. The issue with smoking the freebase version of DMT was that the effects came on hard and fast—smoking DMT in its crystallised form can be a tumultuous ride.\n\nChanga was developed as a remedy to this; the addition of an MAO-I prevents the breakdown of DMT. If users want to experience the mind-altering effects of DMT without the intense onset, or want to ‘break through’ on a lower dose, then Changa may be a more suitable alternative option.\n\nHowever, the effects of Changa don’t last nearly as long as ayahuasca—the effects diminish to negligible levels within 30 minutes to an hour.\n\nThe effects of Changa come from the DMT contained within chacruna. Rick Strassman popularised DMT as “The Spirit Molecule”, as it featured many similar aspects of religious and spiritual experiences. This included strong hallucinations, like hearing voices, and entering an internally generated world that did not depend on sensory experience. \n\nWithin this world, users often have encounters with ‘entities’ from other realms after they have ‘broken through’. The form that these entities take on, however, is intertwined with an individual’s culture, set, and setting.  \n\nWhile these breakthrough experiences are certainly possible with Changa, it is dependent on a large amount being smoked in a short period of time. For a lighter experience, users may smoke changa in a pipe or a joint. This lighter experience is characterised by smaller changes in perception and cognition; the pioneer of Changa, Julian Palmer said that it should “brighten colour, amplify perception and clarify the activity of the mind, and bring alignment to the thoughts.” \n\n— via [What Is Changa?

Though not wart-free, its most notable characteristic may be the toxic, milky-white venom it secretes to poison predators—the indigenous raccoons, birds, and other critters found in the Sonoran Desert region that includes parts of California, Arizona, and northern Mexico. Anthropologists have long surmised that toad venom was used in ancient rituals for its intoxicating effect.\n\nThe substance derived from that venom (and also found in some psychoactive plants) is 5-MeO-DMT, an extremely potent psychedelic that is four to six times stronger than its better-known relative DMT (or dimethyltryptamine). It’s also a Schedule I drug making it illegal to manufacture, distribute, possess, or buy (in Mexico it isn’t regulated).\n\nBufo is smoked directly in a pipe or vape and quickly goes into and out of the bloodstream. The medicine is collected when the Bufo alvarius toad comes out of hibernation—its poison-secreting gland is milked, the venom is collected and dried. It then turns to a powdery crystal that can be smoked. The synthetic version is smoked differently.\n\nBufo’s hallucinogenic effects take hold very quickly—within minutes—after ingestion and last anywhere from 20 minutes to an hour. People who have taken Bufo often describe their experience as being one with the universe and feeling reborn. Some describe a fusion with God, a visceral connection with the divine source. Others experience colors, looping patterns, and a sense of connection with the universe/all beings.\n\n[Bufo Toad Ceremony Therapy: Is 5-MeO-DMT Right for Me?](https://www.psycom.net/psychedelic-toad-medicine)\n","n":0.063}}},{"i":1685,"$":{"0":{"v":"Bikram Yoga","n":0.707},"1":{"v":"\nBikram Yoga is a system of hot yoga, a type of yoga as exercise, devised by Bikram Choudhury and based on the teachings of B.
