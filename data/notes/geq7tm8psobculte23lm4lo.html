<p>Every new idea is remix/mashup of one or more previous ideas.</p>
<p>This new idea will be bigger than the sum of its parts or whatever ideas that it emerged from.</p>
<p>You don't get to choose what genes you're born with, it depends on your parents, you're a remix of your both parent's genes.</p>
<p>Just as you have familial genealogy, you also have a genealogy of ideas.</p>
<p>You get to pick your teachers, your friends, your influences, your taste in music, the books you read.</p>
<p>You're the product of what you let in to your life, the product of your influences.</p>
