Network Attached Storage uses standard file-sharing protocols, like CIFS for the [[Windows]] platform, or NFS for the [[UNIX]] and [[devlog.linux]] platforms for connecting to shared folders without having a server, because the [[NAS]] has firmware to act as a server to serve the content.

- Network storage accessible over standard [[devlog.tcp‚ÅÑip model]] network
- File and folder sync to NAS device
- Backup of NAS data to the cloud
- Accessed via file sharing/streaming protocols ([[NFS]], [[SMB]], [[UPnP]])
