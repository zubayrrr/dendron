<blockquote>
<p>Conium maculatum is the plant that killed Theramenes, Socrates and Phocion. In ancient Greece, hemlock was used to poison condemned prisoners. Socrates, the most famous victim of hemlock poisoning, was accused of impiety and corrupting the minds of the young men of Athens in 399 BC and his trial gave down his death sentence. He decided to take a potent infusion of hemlock. Plato described Socrates' death in the Phaedo.—via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conium_maculatum">Conium maculatum - Wikipedia</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Upon taking his own life, Socrates offered a rooster to god of healing, Asclepius, to pay his debt. To him, death was not defeat but a cure. — Hannibal</p>
