<li>Among the six different types of Humans that have existed, Homo Sapiens survived because of our <a title="Private" style="color: brown" href="https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/hfyvYGJZQiUwQaaxQO27q.html" target="_blank">Prefrontal cortex (Private)</a>, which basically allows us to think more complexly.</li>
<li>Being able to think more complexly allowed us to organize, cultivate, teach, practice, ponder, habituate and create a world more suited for our survival.</li>
<li>Because of our ability to "imagine", we were able to build Earth as it is today out of virtually nothing. (Imagine making a computer out of dust, imagine making a rock think.)</li>
<li>Thoughts create reality is more than just a nice idea, it's a fact of evolution. It was through language and thought we were able to create a world inside our minds and ultimately, "manifest" it in the outside world (society).</li>
