<p>The Teep kick, also known as the push kick or simply as the teep, is a straight kicking technique in Muay Thai. ... This kick is used to push away your opponent and keep them from advancing on you helping to keep your range. In this way, the teep is the kicking equivalent to the jab but its range is around twice as long.</p>
