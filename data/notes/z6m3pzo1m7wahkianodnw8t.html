<p>The artist collects not hoards, your job should be to collect what you really love.</p>
<p>Collect selectively not indiscriminately.</p>
<p>The more good ideas you collect, the bigger pool of ideas you'll have to be influenced from.</p>
<p>If you input garbage ideas you'll output garbage ideas.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Steal from anywhere that resonates with inspiration or fuels your imagination. Devour old films, new films, music, books, paintings, photographs, poems, dreams, random conversations, architecture, bridges, street signs, trees, clouds, bodies of water, light and shadows. Select only things to steal from that speak directly to your soul. If you do this, your work (and theft) will be authentic.” — Jim Jarmusch</p>
