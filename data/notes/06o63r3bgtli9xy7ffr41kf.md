- Women go for good genes in the short term and for resources in the long term
  - Women tend to prefer men who are physically fit
  - symmetrical features
  - masculine features(strong jawline, high shoulder to hip ratio)
    - Shoulders should be wide relative to hips
  - Well toned but not muscle bound
  - Taller(above average, an inch or two)
  - Women may interpret guys who are obsessed about their body with narcissism
- Short term mating for women is not “one night stand”, its more affair mating.
- Why do women have affairs?
  - One theory suggests that they’re trying to get good genes from one partner and resources from the other.
- When women have affairs, 70% of the time they get attached to their partner in crime
  - But men only 30% of the time
- Mating switching hypothesis
  - affairs are one way women diversify themselves
  - to transition into the mating market or to trade up
- We’ve adaptations to switch mates for various (survival) reasons
- In some cultures, a man’s hunting ability(resources) gives them high status
  - In modern cultures on the other hand; cash economies are relatively recent, in the old times you weren’t able to stockpile resources.
  - [[resources.people.steve pinker]] said that you're storing meat in other people
    - by which he means that if you provide for them (say, from your hunt) they'll reciprocate by providing for you
