## Notes

- Tiago writes so know better what he’s thinking, he says, all of ideas sound good in the echo chamber of their thinkers but when they’re put on paper; to let them stand on their own strength, only then they start to show their imperfections.
- Writing is not the _result_ of thinking, it is thinking itself.
