<p>By David Jay Brown</p>
<p>Yohimbe is an herb that is available in most health food stores, which is derived from the inner bark of a tree that is indigenous to West Africa. Brews distilled from yohimbe bark have been used for centuries by natives in this region in order to fuel their<br>
unusually impressive tribal sex ceremonies, which are reported to sometimes last as long as two weeks.<a href="http://www.sexanddrugs.info/#1">1</a></p>
<p>Yohimbine, the most active chemical compound in the yohimbe bark, is actually available as a prescription drug in the United<br>
States for treating impotence. It is prescribed as an alternative to Viagra, due to the fact that it can also help facilitate erections in men. Research studies with yohimbine have shown it to be effective in helping men with impotence problems around 33 to 46 percent of the time.<a href="http://www.sexanddrugs.info/#2">2</a> Some men that I've spoken with report that yohimbe actually gives them spontaneous erections, and that it also increases the amount of semen when they ejaculate.</p>
<p>However, unlike Viagra, many men (and women) report that yohimbine (and yohimbe) also increases sexual desire. Yohimbine was the very first drug to ever be listed in the <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=1563634457/4538-5307408-460592" title="via Amazon.com">Physician's Desk Reference</a></em> (PDR) as having "aphrodisiac" properties, although (strangely) the PDR states that "Generally, this drug is not proposed for use in females." There is little scientific data on the effects of yohimbe and yohimbine on women, although I�ve heard more than a few anecdotal reports that it can also increase sexual desire in women.</p>
<p>Some people report that higher doses of yohimbe can have what are described as mild psychedelic effects that last for several<br>
hours. This includes feelings of euphoria, heightened physical and emotional feelings, and "warm spinal shivers".<a href="http://www.sexanddrugs.info/#3">3</a></p>
<p>However, higher doses of yohimbe cause some people to report that they feel anxious, and, according to the PDR, people<br>
sometimes experience other mild side-effects with yohimbine, such as dizziness, nausea, tremors, increased blood pressure and<br>
elevated heart rate. The PDR also cautions against yohimbine�s use in conjunction with antidepressant medications and other<br>
mood-modifying drugs.</p>
