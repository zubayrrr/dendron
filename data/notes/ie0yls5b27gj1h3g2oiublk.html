<p>Most people that claim that something is original are really just forgetting the references, inspirations to the original sources involved in the creation of that so called "original" work.</p>
<p>Nothing is completely original - and good artists understand this.</p>
<p>All creative works have built on what came before.</p>
<p>We need to accept this and embrace it instead of trying to burden ourselves from trying to create something "original" out of nothing.</p>
