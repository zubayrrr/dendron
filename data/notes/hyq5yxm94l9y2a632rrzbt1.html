<p>A <strong>Scandinavian mile</strong> (Norwegian and Swedish: mil, [miÀêl], like "meal") is a unit of length common in Norway and Sweden, but not Denmark. Today, it is standardised as 1 mil being 10 kilometres (6.2 miles), but it had different values in the past.The word is derived from the same Roman source as the English mile. In Sweden and Norway, the international mile is often distinguished as an "English mile" (engelsk mil), although in situations where confusion may arise it is more common for Scandinavians to describe distances in terms of the official SI unit kilometre.This modern definition of 10km is equivalent to the obsolete myriametre, which was once used in France. </p>
