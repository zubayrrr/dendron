The Falsification Principle, proposed by Karl Popper, is a way of demarcating science from non-science. It suggests that for a theory to be considered scientific it must be able to be tested and conceivably proven false.
For example, the hypothesis that "all swans are white," can be falsified by observing a black swan.
For Popper, science should attempt to disprove a theory, rather than attempt to continually support theoretical hypotheses.

[[resources.people.Karl Popper]] argued that science would best progress using [[archive.deductive reasoning]] (as opposed to [[archive.inductive reasoning]]) as its primary emphasis, known as critical rationalism.
