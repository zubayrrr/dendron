<ul>
<li>Descriptive statistics</li>
</ul>
<p>refer to the direct numerical measurement of characteristics of a population such as how many of something there are, what the average number of some phenomenon is, or what the range of a particular value of something is. I am describing what is there, but not going beyond the data. If I conduct descriptive statistics on all swans to test my hypothesis that all swans are white, I would have to describe every swan. Formally, a population is defined as a well-defined, complete collection of things, objects, and so on. A descriptive analysis requires a description of the entire swan population.</p>
<ul>
<li>Inferential statistics</li>
</ul>
<p>comes to the rescue when I can’t measure all swans, because this approach allows me to measure a sample of swans, a subset of the swan population, and then make inferences or estimates about the population as a whole from the sample that was drawn. Inferential statistics solves the measurement dilemma as long, of course, as you follow some basic rules such as randomization and appropriate sample size.</p>
<p>Randomization allows researchers to make inferences about a population based on the way a sample is chosen. Every member of the population must have the same chance of being in the sample.</p>
<p>Another key ingredient to ensuring that your sample is representative of the population is sample size, the number or n of individuals in your sample</p>

<p>A sample size of one, from a statistical perspective isn't likely to represent the population as a whole? Correspondingly, this is why most people are more likely to trust advice if the same data comes from multiple people.</p>
