<li>Everybody writes, from scholars to students and it doesn't necessarily have to be research papers or essays for college assignments.</li>
<li>It can also be just everyday things, like an idea that you came across, a quote you liked reading, an outcome of a study, something you'd like to remember or memorize.</li>
<li>We also write when we want to exchange ideas with others, organize our own thoughts, share our knowledge with others.</li>
<li>Essentially, every intellectual endeavor starts with a note.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li>Writing(taking notes) plays a critical role in our lives when learning, researching, studying but we hardly discuss about note-taking itself.</li>
<li>Even though there are books on how to be better at writing academic papers, books but there is very little guidance on how to take notes effectively.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Writing starts much earlier than staring at a blank screen.</li>
<li><a href="#How%20to%20Take%20Smart%20Notes">How to Take Smart Notes</a> aims to show how to efficiently turn your thoughts and discoveries into convinving written pieces and build up a treasure of smart and interconnected notes along the way.</li>
<li>Smart notes will not only help you write more easily but also learn for the long run and generate new ideas and bring your projects forward.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li>Writing is not done seperately from research, learning, studying - it is the <em>medium</em> of all of this work(research, learning, studying).</li>
<li>Practising writing itself might not be as impactful as any improvement in how we organize our writing(note-taking), what use we make of it will.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li>Taking bad notes doesn't give immediate negative feedback, when we take notes unsystematically, ineffciently or simply wrong, we might not even realize it until we're in the midst of a deadline panic staring a blank screen.</li>
<li>When we do realize where we went wrong, we may rationalize it by saying some people are just good at it and some are bad - that writing has to be difficult.</li>
<li>When in reality it is really about distinguishing between successful writing strategies from less successful ones.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li>The question people should be asking is what is that they can do weeks, months or even years in prior to writing a great paper/book easily.</li>
<li>Few people struggle with papers because they don't know to cite properly or psychological barrier preventing from writing - because you can easily look up how to cite or you can easily talk your way out of your psychological barriers (when it comes to writing).</li>
<li>The real struggle is when people think writing starts with a blank page - because it doesn't, if you truly believe you're starting from scratch about a topic with a blank page thats a good reason to panic but most of the times you have the information but just not in the right form.</li>
<li>You cannot seriously expect your mind to just pour out all the information it has on the subject while staring a blank screen.</li>
<li>Which is why transforming your existing notes about the subject into an academic paper is far more easy than just starting from scratch while staring at a blank screen.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li>To sum it up: The quality of a paper and the ease with which it is written depends more than anything on <em>what you have done in writing before you even made a decision on the topic</em>. The key to successful writing lies in the preparation.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li>The single most important indicator of acamdeic success if not found in the people's head but in the way they do their everyday work (their routines).</li>
<li>A high IQ can definitely help you get into academia but high IQ alone is not enough to protect you from failure.</li>
<li>What does make a significant difference is how much self-discpline or self-control one uses to approach the tasks at hand.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li>Doing the work required and doing it in a smart way, unsurprisingly, leads to success. It is not important who you're but what you do, and what we do largely depends on self-control and self-discipline.</li>
<li>While we can't do much about our IQ it seems possible to have better self-control and self-discpline with a little bit of willpower.</li>
<li>But the bad news is that willpower is not enough to achieve it due to it being a limited resource that depletes quickly and is not that much up for long term improvement, would you want to flog yourself to work?</li>
<li>Luckily there is a way to make this work without having to rely on willpower and that has to do with our environment - self-control and self-discipline can be developed with the right environment, while we cannot do much about our IQ or our willpower, we can always change our environment, if your body doesn't have access to icecream it won't crave for it.</li>
<li>Nobody needs willpower to do something they wanted to anyway. Every teask that is interesting, meaningful and well-defined will be done, because there is no conflict btween long and short term interests.</li>
<li>Its not about not having willpower, but about not having to use willpower that indicates that you set yourself up for success and this is where the organisation of writing and note-taking comes into play.</li>
