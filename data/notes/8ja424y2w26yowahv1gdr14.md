[[devlog.MySQL]] supports another type of pattern matching operation([[devlog.LIKE]]) based on the [[devlog.regular expression]]s that is REGEXP operator

- It provide a powerful and flexible pattern match that can help us implement power search utilities for our database systems.
- REGEXP is the operator used when performing regular expression pattern matches. [[devlog.RLIKE]] is the synonym.
- It also supports a number of metacharacters which allow more flexibility and control when performing pattern matching.
- The backslash is used as an escape character. Itâ€™s only considered in the pattern match if double backslashes have used.
- Not case sensitive.

<!-- end list -->

    SELECT *
    FROM customers
    WHERE last_name LIKE '%field%'

Instead of using [[devlog.LIKE]]we can use REGEXP such as:

    WHERE last_name REGEXP 'field'

### Patterns

- caret(^) matches beginning of the string
- dollar sign($) matches end of the string
- p1|p2|p3, pipe matches any of the patterns p1, p2, or p3; Alternation
- `[]` - Any character listed between the square brackets
  - `WHERE last_name REGEXP '[gim]e'` searches for last name that ends in `e` but has any of the characters mentioned in the brackets before it.
  - `'[a-h]e'` will look for all characters from a to h before e
