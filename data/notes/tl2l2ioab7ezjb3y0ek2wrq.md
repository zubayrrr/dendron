- If you combine a [[devlog.router]] and a [[devlog.Switch]] you get a Layer 3 Switch
- It is a device used to connect multiple network segments together
- Can make Layer 3 routing decisions and interconnect entire networks (like a [[devlog.router]]), not just network segments (like a [[devlog.Switch]])
- ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zubayrrr/twiki/main/bin/image.zapt16jgiw.png)
- Each of their port acts a [[Broadcast Domains]] and a [[devlog.Collision Domains]].
- A very efficient device for an internal network.
- If you've a large network a Layer 3 Switch is not recommended as they're not as efficient at routing as a dedicated [[devlog.router]] would be.
