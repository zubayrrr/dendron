<blockquote>
<p>असतो मा सद्गमय ।<br>
तमसो मा ज्योतिर्गमय ।<br>
मृत्योर्माऽमृतं गमय ॥</p>
<p>asato mā sadgamaya,<br>
tamaso mā jyotirgamaya,<br>
mṛtyormā'mṛtaṃ gamaya.</p>
<p>Swami Madhavananda offers the following translation:</p>
<p>From evil lead me to good,<br>
From darkness lead me to light,<br>
From death lead me to immortality.</p>
<p>Patrick Olivelle offers a slightly different translation:</p>
<p>From the unreal lead me to the real!<br>
From the darkness lead me to the light!<br>
From death lead me to immortality!</p>
<p>The more common modern translation differs slightly in the translation of the first line</p>
<p>From falsehood lead me to truth,<br>
From darkness lead me to light,<br>
From death lead me to immortality.</p>

<p>These three statements are referred to as the three Pavamana Mantras. Some renderings — generally modern — add ॐ (oṃ) at the beginning and/or ॐ शान्तिः शान्तिः शान्तिः ॥ (oṃ śāntiḥ śāntiḥ śāntiḥ, 'om peace peace peace') as a fourth line. This is a stylistic addition that concludes a recitation; as such it is often included with the verse. The Upanishad itself does not end the line that way — via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pavamana_Mantra">Pavamana Mantra - Wikipedia</a></p>
