Pick one thinker you like and try to chew on them, read everything they read, learn everything about them, then find three thinkers that thinker liked and continue this cycle.

Build you own tree of thinkers and eventually a branch will start from you.

Become apprentice of these thinkers, they cannot refuse you because they have already left their lesson plans in their work, so study from their work.
