All of the logical topologies under [[devlog.Wired Network Topology]] apply to Wireless Network Topologies.

Wireless adds two more layers:

- Infrastructure Mode: Uses a wireless access point as a centralized point (like a star) and supports wireless security controls and centralized management.
- Ad Hoc Mode: Decentralized wireless network which created [[Peer-to-{eer]]connections and does not require a router or an access point.
- Wireless Mesh Topology: Interconnection of different types of nodes, devices, or radios which consists of clients, routers, gateways and other devices (used to create redundant and reliable connections).
