<blockquote>
<p>One of the problems with religion is that it creates in-group loyalty and out-group hostility, even when members of one’s own group are behaving like psychopaths. — Sam Harris</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>secularism is simply a commitment to keeping religion out of politics and public policy. Your religion is your business, and my religion, or lack of one, is mine. A willingness to build a wall of separation between church and state is what defines secularism—but, as you point out, behind that wall one may be a full-blown religious fanatic, so long as one doesn’t try to impose the fruits of one’s fanaticism on others. — Sam Harris</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>After the Islamic State, even al-Qaeda appears “moderate.” The term is so relative—juxtaposed against increasingly worse atrocities—that it has become meaningless. It doesn’t tell us which values the person in question holds. This is why I prefer using terms that denote values, such as “Islamist,” “liberal,” or “conservative” Muslim. — Maajid Nawaz</p>
