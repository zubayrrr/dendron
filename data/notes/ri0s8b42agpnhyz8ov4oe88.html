<li><a title="Private" style="color: brown" href="https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/hfyvYGJZQiUwQaaxQO27q.html" target="_blank">Epictetus (Private)</a> Suggests we only have three things under our complete control.
<ul>
<li>Thought - more precisely, Judgement</li>
<li>Impulse</li>
<li>Will to avoid or to get</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Epictetus isn't suggesting that we can control which thoughts enter our minds or which impulses occur.
<ul>
<li>He was really suggesting what judgments our thoughts can carry and whether or not we decide to act on our impulses.
<ul>
<li>For example: we can control when the impulse/desire for hunger arises but we can control whether or not we should eat.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Likewise, we have the power to accept or reject a thought.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Discipline of desire is to avoid or control the desires that do not contribute to good character.</li>
<li>Ultimately, the thing on which we do have complete control is our character.
<ul>
<li>Our character is sum of our decisions and actions.</li>
<li>We can control our urges and desires and we can make decisions based on sound reasoning and our own set of values and ideals.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Second exercises is about Shifting focus from external to internal things.
<ul>
<li>For example deciding how we use our time and other decision making.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Instead of worrying about the outcome, telling yourself that you did everything in your control to influence(making good decisions) a positive outcome and choose to be happy regardless of the outcome.</li>
