Over the last year, I have seen a lot of people holding a strong stance on how a specific tool could do everything they wanted. Some others were complaining that the tool they were using could not do everything.

## Beware of Maslow's Hammer

> I don't believe in the existence of such a "Golden Hammer". When your tool has a shortcoming you should consider some **complements**.

When we are being adamant about the tool we want to use regardless of the problem we risk formulating problems in a way that makes the available tool the right tool, even if it isn't. **This is dangerous because we might end up solving a problem slightly different from the original one. Or even worse, we might create new problems along the way.**

> If you **only have a hammer,** you tend to **see every problem as a nai**l. — Bernard M. Baruch

Let us be clear, **I am not advocating for a constant change of tools**. Periodic **reviews** and a bit of **research** should slowly bring you closer to the choice that fits you and helps you the most. **We don't have time to try everything** unless our ultimate goal is to try everything.

What you want is a toolbox of tools that you are familiar with and when a problem arises you pick the one that is the most adequate.

Over time see how you can use a selection of tools to solve a variety of problems. To build your own toolbox you can either

- try to look for the **best overall combination**
- you can **choose what you already like using and complement it with other tools** that address its shortcomings.
