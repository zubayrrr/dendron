<p>The <strong>Great Resignation</strong>, also known as the Big Quit and the Great Reshuffle, is an ongoing economic trend in which employees have voluntarily resigned from their jobs en masse, beginning in early 2021, primarily in the United States. Possible causes include wage stagnation amid rising cost of living, long-lasting job dissatisfaction, and safety concerns of the COVID-19 pandemic. Some economists have described the Great Resignation as akin to a general strike.The term "Great Resignation" was coined by Anthony Klotz, a professor of management at Mays Business School at Texas A&#x26;M University, in May 2021, when he predicted a sustained mass exodus.There is disagreement as to whether or not the Great Resignation will have a lasting effect, as many workers in Western countries have been returning to the labor force in large numbers in late 2021 and early 2022. Some suggest that the tightness of the labor market is not due to workers resigning en masse or turning towards self-employment, but instead due to a shortage of migrant workers caused by travel restrictions during the pandemic and a general rise in anti-immigrant sentiment. </p>
