<p>I’ve been tinkering with my Obsidian setup for months now, and it’s finally at a stage where I have something that (nearly) works. In the interest of ‘learning in public’, it felt like a great time to share.</p>
<h2 id="how-do-i-use-obsidian"><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading" href="#how-do-i-use-obsidian"><svg aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 16 16"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a>How Do I Use Obsidian?</h2>
<p>Obsidian is where I:</p>
<ul>
<li>Capture the notes and highlights I make on various forms of input, for example, articles, tweets, academic papers and courses.</li>
<li>Process those capture notes to generate ideas.</li>
<li>Draft and finalise output, for example, articles, based on my ideas.</li>
<li>Journal (my journal consists of a daily note and weekly and annual reviews linked to my goals and other notes in my system.</li>
</ul>
<p>This article will focus on note-taking and note-making rather than journalling.</p>
<h2 id="whats-new"><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading" href="#whats-new"><svg aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 16 16"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a>What’s New?</h2>
<p>The most significant changes are in my folder structure and tagging method. I have introduced a home page to act as a standard operating procedure (for myself) to ensure consistency in my approach. Also, I re-engineered my system to focus on input, action and output.</p>
<p>Incidentally, if you follow me on Twitter, you will be aware of my brief but passionate love affair with the Johnny Decimal system (<a href="https://twitter.com/MartineGuernsey/status/1497225156284096521?s=20&#x26;t=L2Goq32PwZ_RjKW4v0fvhQ">here’s the tweet</a>). While I still think JD’s approach is fantastic for storage organisation (my Google Drive and iCloud are completely JohnnyDecimalised), it is not quite what I need for notes. My notes are a system, not a storage area. From my screenshots below, you will see that I have now moved towards a far shallower hierarchy with comparatively fewer folders.</p>
<p>Many of the changes I have introduced have been influenced by others, particularly <a href="https://www.youtube.com/dannyhatcher">Danny Hatcher</a> (I watch all of his videos) and Elizabeth Butler (I love her <a href="https://gumroad.com/a/500388979/VtAjF">Calmer Notes</a> approach). I must also mention my Twitter pal, Constantin, who wrote <a href="https://constantinluegering.de/johnny-decimal-is-a-great-guy-but-we-are-not-best-friends/">a brilliant article</a> off the back of my original JD love tweet.</p>

<p>The diagram below shows my overarching personal knowledge management system.</p>

<p>Here is a screenshot of my new Home page — this outlines the critical elements of my system. Notice the emphasis on input, output and action (my tags).</p>
<p><img src="/assets/10GEmRs0gxitohW32DZ__Ug.png"></p>
<p>I include all input and output tags on my New Input Note and New Output Note templates and delete those that do not apply when the template is loaded.</p>
<p>My New Input Note template looks like this:</p>
<p><img src="/assets/1b1jXP8fpAleSEt3g_vt6Ow.png"></p>
<p>My New Output Note template looks like this:</p>
<p><img src="/assets/17W8tTNu0OZSR9vjlIpYFtQ.png"></p>
<p>Crucially, I have ‘<a title="Private" style="color: brown" href="https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/hfyvYGJZQiUwQaaxQO27q.html" target="_blank">#wip (Private)</a>’ and ‘<a title="Private" style="color: brown" href="https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/hfyvYGJZQiUwQaaxQO27q.html" target="_blank">#to-process (Private)</a>’ tag searches starred and visible at all times. That way, they stay top of mind and do not get ignored.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/1OmeeD9meg9cG7Vc1tplfyQ.png"></p>
<p>And that folder structure? Here’s my Obsidian sidebar:</p>

<p>I have the Capture and Permanent aspects of my systems working well now, but I still capture far more than I create. In other words, there is way too much in the Capture area and not enough in Permanent. The reason for this is that I still have not finessed my Working process — this is when I take what I have captured and work on making it something of my own. That’s what I am developing next.</p>

<p>That’s it (as of March 2022), but I am sure there will be an update soon. Leave me a comment if you have questions or would like to grab a copy of any of my templates. Also, I’d love it if you shared your own systems with me on <a href="https://twitter.com/MartineGuernsey">Twitter</a>. Let’s nerd out about PKM.</p>
