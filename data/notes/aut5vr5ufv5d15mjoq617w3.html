<p>One of the cardinal rules of science is that whatever is being investigated must yield to he empirical test and be replicated. That is, the existence of something, be it a theory for example, must be verifiable or disprovable by repeated observation, measurement, and experimentation.</p>
<p>Scientists don’t just say, “Take my word for it!” They say, “I’ll test it and if I’m right, okay. If I’m not, then we’ll make adjustments.”</p>
