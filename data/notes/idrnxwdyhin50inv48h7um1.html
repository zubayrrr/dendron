<p>Pick one thinker you like and try to chew on them, read everything they read, learn everything about them, then find three thinkers that thinker liked and continue this cycle.</p>
<p>Build you own tree of thinkers and eventually a branch will start from you.</p>
<p>Become apprentice of these thinkers, they cannot refuse you because they have already left their lesson plans in their work, so study from their work.</p>
