<ul>
<li>There are a lot of networks and not just computer networks.</li>
<li>The purpose of these networks is to make connections between different machines.</li>
<li>Network between your personal devices such as a smart watch and a smart phone over <a href="/notes/sp5wj63pztdvt98eu4dbiic">Bluetooth</a> is called a <a title="Private" style="color: brown" href="https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/hfyvYGJZQiUwQaaxQO27q.html" target="_blank">PAN (Private)</a>.</li>
<li>There is also the typical <a href="/notes/mygms43r4xeguoaflrlzlkr">Wi-Fi</a> network when you're connected through the wireless access point that connects out to the internet.</li>
<li>Or it can also be your desktop connected to a <a href="/notes/pkic9qil8dq2q3bqmk01047">Hub</a> which is connected to a <a href="/notes/arlkpmdlwn4hm2n8iu7gmgs">Switch</a> that is connected to a Router and the <a href="/notes/7r0uunvdkt9sgw6ajq5vg0x">router</a> ultimately connected to the internet.</li>
<li>All of these networks combined are known as Converged Network.</li>
<li>In the old days we had different networks for different purposes such as a Telephone Network to make Analog Phone Calls seperate from Computer Network for digital things.</li>
<li>Overtime this has merged and we now have all one network taking care of all things. (A digital network)</li>
<li>Uptime is really important for these networks and people expect the network to be up 100% of the time but thats unrealistic, sometime has to be sacrificed for maintainence and other things but most networks are guaranteed uptime for 99.999% of time time (The 5 nines of availability)</li>
<li>Throughout the course of the year 5 minutes of downtime allowed per year.</li>
<li>Network traffic can be:
<ul>
<li>File sharing</li>
<li>Video chatting</li>
<li>Web surfing</li>
<li>Social media</li>
<li>Video streaming</li>
<li>Email</li>
<li>Messaging</li>
<li>VoIP</li>
</ul>
