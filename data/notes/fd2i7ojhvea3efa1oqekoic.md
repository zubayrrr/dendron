**Reversible inhibition of sperm under guidance** (**RISUG**), formerly referred to as the synthetic [polymer](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymer "Polymer") [styrene maleic anhydride](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Styrene_maleic_anhydride "Styrene maleic anhydride") (**SMA**), is the development name of a [male contraceptive](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Male_contraceptive "Male contraceptive") injection developed at [IIT Kharagpur](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Institute_of_Technology_Kharagpur "Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur") in [India](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/India "India") by the team of Dr. [Sujoy K. Guha](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sujoy_K._Guha "Sujoy K. Guha").\[_[citation needed](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_\]

RISUG has been patented in India, China, Bangladesh, and the United States.[\[1\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-dailypioneer-1) [Phase III](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phases_of_clinical_research#Phase_III "Phases of clinical research") clinical trials were underway in India, and were slowed by insufficient volunteers.[\[1\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-dailypioneer-1)

As of 2011, a contraceptive product based on RISUG, **Vasalgel**, was under development in the US by [Parsemus Foundation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsemus_Foundation "Parsemus Foundation"), but funding was uncertain.[\[2\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-Wired-2) As of 2021, RSUG and Vasalgel were still in development and testing.[\[3\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-3)\[_[better source needed](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:NOTRS "Wikipedia:NOTRS")_\]

## Development[Edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Reversible_inhibition_of_sperm_under_guidance&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Development")

[Sujoy K. Guha](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sujoy_K._Guha "Sujoy K. Guha") developed RISUG after years of developing other inventions. He originally wanted to create an artificial heart that could pump blood using a strong electrical pulse. Using the 13-chamber model of a cockroach heart, he designed a softer pumping mechanism that would theoretically be safe to use in humans.[\[4\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-4) As India's population grew throughout the 1970s, Guha modified his heart pump design to create a water pump that could work off of differences in ionic charges between salt water and fresh water in water treatment facilities. This filtration system did not require electricity and could potentially help large groups of people have access to clean water. India, however, decided that the population problem would be better served by developing more effective contraception. So Guha again modified his design to work safely inside the body, specifically inside the male genitalia. The non-toxic polymer of RISUG also uses differences in the charges of the [semen](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semen "Semen") to rupture the [sperm](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sperm "Sperm") as it flows through the [vas deferens](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vas_deferens "Vas deferens").[\[2\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-Wired-2)

[Intellectual property](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellectual_property "Intellectual property") rights to RISUG in the United States were acquired between 2010 and 2012 by the [Parsemus Foundation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsemus_Foundation "Parsemus Foundation"), a [not-for-profit organization](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonprofit_organization "Nonprofit organization"), which has branded it as "Vasalgel".[\[5\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-Beck_2011-06-14-5)[\[6\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-6) Vasalgel, which has a slightly different formulation than RISUG, underwent [animal trials](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_testing "Animal testing") in the United States, but reversibility proved unsuccessful.[\[7\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-Francis-7) Initially, researchers were optimistic that human trials would commence by the end of 2013 and become available within a few years.[\[8\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-8) After delays in development, human trials were expected to commence in 2018.[\[9\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-9)

## Mechanisms[Edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Reversible_inhibition_of_sperm_under_guidance&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Mechanisms")

RISUG works by an injection into the vas deferens, the vessel through which the sperm moves before [ejaculation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ejaculation "Ejaculation"). RISUG is similar to [vasectomy](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasectomy "Vasectomy") in that a local anesthetic is administered, an incision is made in the [scrotum](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrotum "Scrotum"), and the vasa deferentia are injected with a polymer gel (rather than being cut and cauterized).[\[10\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-PPAA-10) In a matter of minutes, the [injection](<https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)> "Injection (medicine)") coats the walls of the vasa with a clear gel made of 60 mg of the [copolymer](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copolymer "Copolymer") [styrene/maleic anhydride](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Styrene_maleic_anhydride "Styrene maleic anhydride") (SMA) with 120 [µl](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microlitre "Microlitre") of the solvent [dimethyl sulfoxide](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimethyl_sulfoxide "Dimethyl sulfoxide"). The copolymer is made by [irradiation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irradiation "Irradiation") of the two [monomers](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monomer "Monomer") with a dose of 0.2 to 0.24 [megarad](<https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rad_(unit)> "Rad (unit)") for every 40 g of copolymer and a dose rate of 30 to 40 rad/s. Dr Pradeep K. Jha, a senior scientist, worked on the effects of gamma dose rate and total dose interrelation on molecular designing and biological function of polymer.[\[11\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-11) The source of irradiation is [cobalt-60](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cobalt-60 "Cobalt-60") [gamma radiation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_radiation "Gamma radiation").\[_[citation needed](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_\]

The effect the chemical has on sperm is not completely understood. Originally, researchers thought it lowered the [pH](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/PH "PH") of the environment enough to kill the sperm.[\[12\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-12)

Guha theorizes that the polymer surface has a negative and positive [electric charge](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge "Electric charge") mosaic. Within an hour after placement the differential charge from the gel will rupture the sperm's [cell membrane](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_membrane "Cell membrane") as it passes through the vas, deactivating it before it can exit from the body.[\[13\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-13)

## Safety[Edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Reversible_inhibition_of_sperm_under_guidance&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Safety")

The thoroughness of [carcinogenicity](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcinogenicity "Carcinogenicity") and [toxicity](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxicity "Toxicity") testing in clinical trials had been questioned after [phase I](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phases_of_clinical_research#Phase_I "Phases of clinical research") of clinical trials on the basis of presence of styrene and maleic anhydride in the formulation. In response, Guha argued that substances can be individually toxic in nature but harmless as compounds like pure chlorine, which can melt human flesh on its own, but, when combined with sodium, it becomes sodium chloride – the basic salt that people consume in their diets. When it did not persuade [ICMR](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Council_of_Medical_Research "Indian Council of Medical Research") and the clinical trials did not resume by 1996, he went to the Supreme court and the next round of clinical trials resumed afterwards.[\[14\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-TheWire-14)

In October 2002, [India's Ministry of Health](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_health_ministry "Indian health ministry") aborted the clinical trials due to reports of [albumin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_serum_albumin "Human serum albumin") in [urine](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urine "Urine")\[_[citation needed](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_\] and scrotal swelling in [phase III trial](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial#Phase_III "Clinical trial") participants. Although the [ICMR](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Council_of_Medical_Research "Indian Council of Medical Research") has reviewed and approved the toxicology data three times, [WHO](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization "World Health Organization") and Indian researchers say that the studies were not done according to recent international standards. Due to the lack of any evidence for adverse effects, trials were restarted in 2011.[\[2\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-Wired-2) Guha says concerns over the safety and efficacy of the drug have mainly come from the NIH and WHO.[\[14\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-TheWire-14)

## Availability and marketing[Edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Reversible_inhibition_of_sperm_under_guidance&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Availability and marketing")

By November 2019, the [ICMR](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Council_of_Medical_Research "Indian Council of Medical Research") had successfully completed clinical trials of the world's first injectable male contraceptive, which was then sent to the Drug Controller General of India (DCGI) for regulatory approval. The trials were over, including extended, phase III clinical trials, for which 303 candidates were recruited with 97.3% success rate and no reported side effects.[\[15\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-15)

In the [developed world](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developed_world "Developed world"), the average time taken for a drug to go from concept to market is 10 to 15 years, whereas, it has been over four decades since Guha published his original paper on RISUG.[\[14\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-TheWire-14) RISUG is an inexpensive, single-use drug which does not require major surgery, thus making it an unprofitable business model for drug companies who work on the principle of continuous demand and long term profit. RISUG aims to provide males with years-long fertility control, thereby overcoming compliance problems and avoiding ongoing costs associated with condoms and the female [birth control pill](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth_control_pill "Birth control pill"), which must be taken daily.[\[16\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-16)

Pharmaceutical companies have expressed little interest in RISUG.[\[17\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-Khilwani-17) One obstacle facing marketing of the product is that men generally perceive contraception as a woman's issue. Men may also choose not to use alternative methods of contraception because there are fewer options for birth control for them than there are for women, or they may fear the side effects, or it may conflict with their cultural or religious beliefs.[\[17\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-Khilwani-17)

## Smart RISUG[Edit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Reversible_inhibition_of_sperm_under_guidance&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Smart RISUG")

Smart RISUG is a newer version of the male contraception that was published in 2009. The polymer adds iron oxide and copper particles to the original compound, giving it magnetic properties and the name "Smart RISUG". After injection the exact location of the polymer inside the vas deferens can be measured and visualized by [X-ray](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray "X-ray") and [magnetic resonance imaging](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging "Magnetic resonance imaging"). The polymer location can also be externally controlled using a pulsed magnetic field. With this magnetic field, the polymer can change location inside the body to maximize sterility or can be removed to restore fertility. The polymer has [magnetoelastic behavior](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_magnetostrictive_effect "Inverse magnetostrictive effect") that allows it to stretch and elongate to better line the vas deferens. The iron oxide component is necessary to prevent agglomeration.

With the presence of iron particles, the polymer has lower protein binding and therefore prevents agglomeration. The copper particles in the compound allow the polymer to conduct heat. When an external microwave applies heat to the polymer, it can liquify the polymer again to be excreted to restore fertility. Smart RISUG is therefore a better choice for men who want to use RISUG as temporary birth control, since it does not require a second surgery to restore fertility. The addition of metal ions also increases the effectiveness of the spermicide. The low frequency electromagnetic field disintegrates the sperm cell membrane in the head region. This in turn causes both [acrosin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acrosin "Acrosin") and [hyaluronidase](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyaluronidase "Hyaluronidase") enzymes to leak out of the sperm, making the sperm infertile.

The safety of Smart RISUG is uncertain and requires additional research. The spermicidal properties of the compound should not have negative effects on the lining of the vas deferens. [Albino](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albino "Albino") rats used to develop the new polymer did not have any adverse symptoms.[\[18\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-18) The original compound had been tested for over 25 years in rats.[\[7\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-Francis-7)
