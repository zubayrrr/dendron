<p><strong>MTBF</strong></p>
<p>"Mean time between failures", its the average time between repairable failures of a technology product. The metric is used to track both the availability and reliability of a product. The higher the time between failure, the more reliable the system.</p>
<p><strong>MTTR</strong></p>
<p>It can stand for "Mean time to"; The R can stand for repair, recovery, respond, or resolve, and while the four metrics do overlap, they each have their own meaning and nuance.</p>
<p><strong>MTTA</strong></p>
<p>"Mean time to acknowledge" its the average time it takes from when an alert is triggered to when work begins on the issue. This metric is useful for tracking your team’s responsiveness and your alert system’s effectiveness.</p>
<p><strong>MTTF</strong></p>
<p>"Mean time to failure" is the average time between non-repairable failures of a technology product. The calculation is used to understand how long a system will typically last, determine whether a new version of a system is outperforming the old, and give customers information about expected lifetimes and when to schedule check-ups on their system.</p>

<p>Though they are sometimes used interchangeably, each metric provides a different insight. When used together, they can tell a more complete story about how successful your team is with incident management and where the team can improve.</p>

<p>Mean time to recovery tells you how quickly you can get your systems back up and running.</p>
<p>Layer in mean time to respond and you get a sense for how much of the recovery time belongs to the team and how much is your alert system.</p>
<p>Further layer in mean time to repair and you start to see how much time the team is spending on repairs vs. diagnostics.</p>
<p>Add mean time to resolve to the mix and you start to understand the full scope of fixing and resolving issues beyond the actual downtime they cause.</p>
<p>Fold in mean time between failures and the picture gets even bigger, showing you how successful your team is at preventing or reducing future issues.</p>
<p>And then add mean time to failure to understand the full lifecycle of a product or system.</p>
