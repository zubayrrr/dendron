<blockquote>
<p>Post-traumatic growth (PTG) is a theory that explains this kind of transformation following trauma. It was developed by psychologists Richard Tedeschi, PhD, and Lawrence Calhoun, PhD, in the mid-1990s, and holds that people who endure psychological struggle following adversity can often see positive growth afterward.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"People develop new understandings of themselves, the world they live in, how to relate to other people, the kind of future they might have and a better understanding of how to live life," says Tedeschi. â€” via (<a href="https://www.apa.org/monitor/2016/11/growth-trauma">https://www.apa.org/monitor/2016/11/growth-trauma</a>)</p>
