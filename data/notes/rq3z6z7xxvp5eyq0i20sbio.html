<p>Maya (; Devanagari: माया, IAST: māyā), literally "illusion" or "magic", has multiple meanings in Indian philosophies depending on the context. In later Vedic texts, Māyā connotes a "magic show, an illusion where things appear to be present but are not what they seem"; the principle which shows "attributeless Absolute" as having "attributes". Māyā also connotes that which "is constantly changing and thus is spiritually unreal" (in opposition to an unchanging Absolute, or Brahman), and therefore "conceals the true character of spiritual reality".In the Advaita Vedanta school of Hindu philosophy, Maya, "appearance", is "the powerful force that creates the cosmic illusion that the phenomenal world is real." In this nondualist school, Maya at the individual level appears as the lack of knowledge (avidhya) of the real Self, Atman-Brahman, mistakingly identifying with the body-mind complex and its entanglements.In Hinduism, Maya is also an epithet for goddess Lakshmi, and the name of a manifestation of Lakshmi, the goddess of "wealth, prosperity and love".In Buddhist philosophy, Māyā is invoked as one of twenty subsidiary unwholesome mental factors, responsible for deceit or concealment about the nature of things. Maya is also the name of Gautama Buddha's mother.</p>
