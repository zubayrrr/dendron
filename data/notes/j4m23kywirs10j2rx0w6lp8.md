> "Be careful, however, lest this reading of many authors and books of every sort may tend to make you discursive and unsteady. You must linger among a limited number of master-thinkers, and digest their works if you would derive ideas which shall win firm hold in your mind. Everywhere means nowhere. (...) And in reading of many books is distraction..." - [[Seneca]]
