<ul>
<li>Central Processing Unit; is the "brain" of the computer</li>
<li>It does all the computation</li>
<li>We can have Multi-core CPUs; Multiple CPUs within a single physical chip</li>
<li>CPU speed is measured in Gigahertz(Ghz)</li>
<li>Common CPU manufacturers include: AMD, Intel</li>

<ul>
<li>L1, L2, L3 cache - they're high-speed memory used to cache recently used processing intructions. L1 is considered to be fastest. More cache memory is better but they come in small quantity as they're expensive.</li>
<li>32-bit vs 64-bit (modern)</li>
<li>Virtualization extensions(function of BIOS)</li>
<li>Overclocking is an option to run the CPU at a faster speed than it's been safely tested at</li>
<li>A integrated GPU - graphics processing capabilities as part of the CPU, which would negate the need of a separate video card(they're usually not very high-end though)</li>
<li>When Hyper-threading is enabled, the OS will assume the computer as 2 logical CPUs even though we only have 1 physical CPU</li>
<li>Liquid cooling systems</li>
<li>Fan with heat sink to draw heat away from the board</li>
<li>Thermal paste to withstand heat but keeps heat sink and other components together</li>
