All artists or at least honest artists will tell you that there ideas are usually stolen.

This is how an artist looks at the world (or at least they should) - Everything in this world is either worth stealing or not worth stealing.

If you don't find something worth stealing today, you might find it tomorrow, the next month or the next year but its time will come, everything is up for grabs.
