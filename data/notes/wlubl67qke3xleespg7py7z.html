<blockquote>
<p>The process scheduler is responsible for choosing which processes run and for how long. A scheduler is the basic part of a multitasking operating system like Linux.</p>
<p>A multitasking operating system gives the illusion that multiple tasks are running at once when in fact there is only a limited set of processors. There are two kinds of multitasking operating systems: preemptive and cooperative.</p>
<p>Linux is a preemptive operating system. Preemptive operating systems decide when to stop executing a process, and which new process should begin running. The amount of time a process runs is usually determined before it’s scheduled, this is called the timeslice and it is effectively a slice of the processors time [1, P. 41].</p>
<p>In cooperative operating systems the scheduler relies on the process to explicitly tell the scheduler that it’s ready to stop (this is often called yielding). Cooperative operating systems have a problem where tasks that don’t yield can bring down the entire operating system. The last mainstream cooperative OSes were Mac OS 9 and Windows 3.1 [1, P. 42].</p>
<p>The Linux scheduler has gone through several iterations. The latest scheduler—CFS (the Completely Fair Scheduler)—uses the concept of fair scheduling from queue theory [1, P. 42].</p>
