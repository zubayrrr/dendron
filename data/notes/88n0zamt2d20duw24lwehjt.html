<p>Time-sharing enables many people, located at various terminals, to use a particular computer system at the same time. Multitasking or Time-Sharing Systems is a logical extension of multiprogramming. Processor’s time is shared among multiple users simultaneously is termed as time-sharing.</p>
<p>The main difference between Time-Sharing Systems and Multiprogrammed Batch Systems is that in case of Multiprogrammed batch systems, the objective is to maximize processor use, whereas in Time-Sharing Systems, the objective is to minimize response time. — via <a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/time-sharing-operating-system">Time-Sharing Operating system</a></p>
