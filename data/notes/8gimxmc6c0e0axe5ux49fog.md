The human nervous system consists of two large divisions: the central nervous system (CNS) and the peripheral nervous system (PNS). The CNS includes the brain and spinal cord. The PNS includes the nerves outside the CNS; they are in the rest (the periphery) of the body. The basic building blocks of the nervous system are nerves, neurons, and neu- rotransmitters and glial cells.

Neurochemical electrical changes throughout the nervous system serve as a basic mechanism for psychological functions.Because these electrical changes involve the movement of chemical ions, the transmission system is called an electrochemical system.

Neurotransmitters are chemicals that play a critical role in transmitting signals between neurons. The glial cells are cells within the nervous system that plays a variety of support roles for the neurons; they protect neurons from damage, repair them when they are damaged, and remove damaged or dead tissue when it can’t be repaired

Some scientists propose that the biological study of the brain is really the study of neurons in networks. This approach is known as the neurocomputational approach to brain functioning. It’s “computational” because these researchers base their models of brain function- ing on the calculation processes of neurons in networks as they interact with each other by turning each other on and off with electrochemical signaling.

Scientists look at the nervous system in two basic ways: anatomical organization and functional organization. Looking at the nervous system from an anatomical (or anatomy) viewpoint essentially focuses on the parts, and the functional organization view is concerned with what those parts do with respect to mental processes and behavior.

A neuron is considered the information cell; it’s involved in the processing and storage of information. Neurons contain the following parts:

- Soma: The cell body of the neuron containing the nucleus and supportive structures of the cell, including the mitochondria
- Dendrite: Projections from the cell body that receive information from other neurons
- Axon: The nerve fiber that conducts the electrical impulse
- Terminal button: The end of the axon involved in neurotransmitter release and signaling to other neurons

when information from the environment (or inside the brain itself from other neurons) comes into the brain through the sensory organs and activates a particular neuron (or, more often, a set of neurons), an action potential is created.

Action potentials are the movement of electrochemical energy through a neuron toward its terminal button, toward other neurons. Something called the all-or-none law states that neurons are either “on” or “off”; they are either firing an action potential or not. After a neuron is activated, it fires. If it’s not activated: no action, no fire! It’s electrochemical.

When a neuron is not firing, it is considered to be in the state of a resting potential and its electrical charge is more negative on the inside relative to the outside.

When a neuron receives a signal from another neuron, gates in the cell membrane (its covering) open and positive ions rush into the negatively charged inside of the cell. When the action potential occurs, the cell cannot fire again for a short period of time. During this refractory period, small pumps in the cell membrane work to reset the neuron by moving positive ions back out of the cell, returning the chemical balance of the neuron to its original state to prepare for another round of action.

Neurons don’t actually connect to each other in a physical sense. There are gaps between them known as synapse, spaces between axon terminals of one neuron (the neuron sending the signal) and the dendrites of the next neuron (the neuron receiving the signal); this is where inter-neuronal ­communication happens through chemical messengers called neurotransmitters. Although they are only millionths of an inch apart, the sending neuron throws its “message in a bottle” into the synapse, where it drifts to the other shore (the receiving dendrite).

Neurotransmitters are stored in the axon of the sending cell. An action potential stimulates their release into the synapse. They travel (actually drift) to a receiving neuron in which specialized docks known as receptor sites are present. Different shaped neurotransmitters have different docks.

Basically, neurotransmitters have one of two effects; they either excite the receiving neuron (make it more likely to fire) or inhibit the receiving neuron (make it less likely to fire). Some neurotransmitters are excitatory and some are inhibitory. Whether a particular neuron fires (transmits a signal) depends on the balance between excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters.

Scientists have discovered more than 100 neurotransmitters in the human brain.
Many, including the following, play a major role:

- [[archive.Glutamate]]: The most common excitatory neurotransmitter
- GABA: The most common inhibitory transmitter; involved in eating, aggression, and sleep
- Acetylcholine: A common neurotransmitter with multiple excitatory and inhibitory functions; involved in movement and memory

Another group of four chemically similar neurotransmitters modify behavior in many ways. These neurotransmitters are particularly important regarding psychological disorders:

- Serotonin: An inhibitory transmitter that is involved in balancing excitatory transmitters as well as mood, sleep, eating, and pain
- Dopamine: Can be either inhibitory or excitatory and is implicated in attention, pleasure and reward, and movement
- Epinephrine: An excitatory transmitter related to stress responses, heart rate,
  and blood pressure
- Norepinephrine: An excitatory transmitter involved in energy regulation, anxiety, and fear

Following the docking process, neurotransmitters are either broken down by enzymes or reabsorbed by the sending neurons in a process called reuptake. These two processes clear neurotransmitters from the synapse after they have done their job

Neurotransmitter manipulation is a primary mechanism of action for most psychiatric medications.

An estimated 86 billion neurons live in the human brain and form trillions of connections among themselves.

The brain is a “massively parallel” information-processing system. If each neuron was connected to only one other neuron, the neuron system would be considered “massively serial.” Compared to electronic signals, neural signals travel very slowly (like 5–100 mph), so it is efficient to do many things at once — called [[devlog.parallel processing]].

Not every neuron is connected to every other neuron, but neurons are connected to multiple others that form clusters or networks involved in particular psychological processes and behaviors.
