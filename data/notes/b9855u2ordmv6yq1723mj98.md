### Troubleshooting for connectivity issues

- `route -n` to get default gateway
- `ping defaultGW` if the ping doesn't work, theres a problem with LAN, maybe unauthenticated to the wireless access point or you don't have the right IP Address set.
- ping a public IP Address on the internet, something stable like public DNS Server of Google (8.8.8.8) or public DNS Server of Cloudflare (1.1.1.1)
  - ping 8.8.8.8
  - ping 1.1.1.1
  - If this doesn't work, theres an internet connectivity issue, check router configuration or check with [[devlog.ISP]].
- ping an inter domain, something like google.com
  - If this doesn't work, you've a DNS issue, check that you're correct [[devlog.dns]] and theres nothing filtering the packets, probably a configuration error related to DNs on your side or the DNS server is down.
  - change the DNS Server to 8.8.8.8 and try again.
