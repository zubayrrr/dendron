<p>I am the very model of an amateur grammarian<br>
I have a little knowledge and I am authoritarian<br>
But I make no apology for being doctrinarian<br>
We must not plummet to the verbal depths of the barbarian</p>
<p>I’d sooner break my heart in two than sunder an infinitive<br>
And I’d disown my closest family within a minute if<br>
They dared to place a preposition at a sentence terminus<br>
Or sully the Queen’s English with neologisms verminous</p>
<p>I know that ‘soon’ and not ‘right now’ is the true sense of ‘presently’<br>
I’m happy to correct you and I do it oh so pleasantly<br>
I’m not a grammar Nazi; I’m just a linguistic Aryan<br>
I am the very model of an amateur grammarian</p>
<p>I’m sure people appreciate my pointing out their grammar gaffes<br>
And sorting out their sentences and crossing out their paragraphs<br>
When you crusade for good English, it’s not all doom and gloom you sow<br>
The secret of success is: it’s not who you know; it’s whom you know</p>
<p>The standards of our language are declining almost every day<br>
Down from a peak in 18– or 19– I think – well, anyway<br>
Pop music, TV, blogs and texting are inflicting ravages<br>
Upon English and unchecked, this will turn us into savages</p>
<p>I fear that sloppy language is a sign of immorality<br>
For breaking rules of grammar is akin to criminality<br>
So curse those trendy linguists, lexicographers and anyone<br>
Who shuns the model English of the amateur grammarian</p>
<p>Conjunctions at the openings of sentences are sickening<br>
I wish that the decline of the subjunctive were not quickening<br>
And that more people knew the proper meaning of ‘anticipate’<br>
Of ‘fulsome’ and ‘enormity’, ‘fortuitous’ and ‘decimate’</p>
<p>I learned these rules at school and of correctness they’re my surety<br>
I cling to them for safety despite having reached maturity<br>
Some say that language changes, but good English is immutable<br>
And so much common usage now is deeply disreputable</p>
<p>My pedantry’s demanding but I try not to feel bitter at<br>
The fact that everyone I meet is borderline illiterate<br>
When all around are wrong then I am proud to be contrarian<br>
I am the very model of an amateur grammarian</p>
