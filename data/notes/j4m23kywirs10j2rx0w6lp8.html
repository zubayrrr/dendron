<blockquote>
<p>"Be careful, however, lest this reading of many authors and books of every sort may tend to make you discursive and unsteady. You must linger among a limited number of master-thinkers, and digest their works if you would derive ideas which shall win firm hold in your mind. Everywhere means nowhere. (...) And in reading of many books is distraction..." - <a title="Private" style="color: brown" href="https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/hfyvYGJZQiUwQaaxQO27q.html" target="_blank">Seneca (Private)</a></p>
