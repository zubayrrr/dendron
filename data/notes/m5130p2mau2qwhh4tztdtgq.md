> Hanlon's razor is an adage or rule of thumb that states "never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity". Known in several other forms, it is a philosophical razor that suggests a way of eliminating unlikely explanations for human behavior. It is likely named after Robert J. Hanlon, who submitted the statement to a joke book. Similar statements have been recorded since at least the 18th century.â€”via [Hanlon's razor - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanlon's_razor)
