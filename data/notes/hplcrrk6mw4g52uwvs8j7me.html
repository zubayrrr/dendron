<p>A power supply unit or a PSU is used in personal computers to bring in power from the power grid in the form of AC or Alternating current and then convert it to direct current or DC required by the internal digital components.</p>
<ul>
<li>It is rated in watts(W) in terms of power that it can supply, so the more internal components you have the more power needs to be drawn out to power all of those components hence requiring high rated PSU (in terms of wattage).</li>
<li>When replacing a PSU, we also need to consider the form factor such as ATX, Flex ATX(smaller, slimmer).</li>
<li>PSU has connectors coming out of it so we can use them to power different internal devices such as a: Motherboard 24 pin, SATA, 6/8 pin PCI-Express(required for high-end video cards).</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Alternating Current(AC).</li>
<li>115V is whats common in US, Canada (coming out of the wall).</li>
<li>220V is whats common in Europe.</li>
<li>Older PSUs have a switch on the back to switch between different voltage levels manually(newer models don't have these because they can detect whatever is coming from the wall and switch the voltage).</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Direct Current(DC) is required for digital circuits.</li>
<li>How many Volts are available depends on the power connector coming from the PSU.</li>
<li>3.3/5.5V: Power to digital circuits.</li>
<li>12V to power motors(fans, <a title="Private" style="color: brown" href="https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/hfyvYGJZQiUwQaaxQO27q.html" target="_blank">HDD (Private)</a>s).</li>
