<blockquote>
<p>Continuous integration is a DevOps software development practice where developers regularly merge their code changes into a central repository, after which automated builds and tests are run. Continuous integration most often refers to the build or integration stage of the software release process and entails both an automation component (e.g. a CI or build service) and a cultural component (e.g. learning to integrate frequently). The key goals of continuous integration are to find and address bugs quicker, improve software quality, and reduce the time it takes to validate and release new software updates. — via <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/devops/continuous-integration/">What is Continuous Integration? – Amazon Web Services</a></p>

<p>CI - Merging changes back into the main branch as often as possible so they can be automatically built and tested.</p>

<p>Continuous Delivery - Focuses on safely getting changes out to production. <strong>There is a stop for approval before getting to production.</strong> Release process is automated and new builds can be done quickly.</p>
<p>Continuous Deployment - an update is automated the whole way out to production without the safeguards of Continuous Delivery. The entire software deployment process is automated.</p>
