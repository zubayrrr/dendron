<p>Over the last year, I have seen a lot of people holding a strong stance on how a specific tool could do everything they wanted. Some others were complaining that the tool they were using could not do everything.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I don't believe in the existence of such a "Golden Hammer". When your tool has a shortcoming you should consider some <strong>complements</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When we are being adamant about the tool we want to use regardless of the problem we risk formulating problems in a way that makes the available tool the right tool, even if it isn't. <strong>This is dangerous because we might end up solving a problem slightly different from the original one. Or even worse, we might create new problems along the way.</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you <strong>only have a hammer,</strong> you tend to <strong>see every problem as a nai</strong>l. — Bernard M. Baruch</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let us be clear, <strong>I am not advocating for a constant change of tools</strong>. Periodic <strong>reviews</strong> and a bit of <strong>research</strong> should slowly bring you closer to the choice that fits you and helps you the most. <strong>We don't have time to try everything</strong> unless our ultimate goal is to try everything.</p>
<p>What you want is a toolbox of tools that you are familiar with and when a problem arises you pick the one that is the most adequate.</p>
<p>Over time see how you can use a selection of tools to solve a variety of problems. To build your own toolbox you can either</p>
<ul>
<li>try to look for the <strong>best overall combination</strong></li>
<li>you can <strong>choose what you already like using and complement it with other tools</strong> that address its shortcomings.</li>
</ul>
