<p>Though the Mahābhārata describes a society distracted by deceit and intrigue and though the story is reeking with war and the spirit of war, the author clearly declares himself against the politics of power and looks upon the state not as an organisation of force but as a partnership in dharma. Th e modern apostles of the doctrine that the state is an end in itself with no higher duty than to maintain itself, will not find support for their views in it. Th e view that the end of the state is to organise and establish dharma, that its powers are strictly limited by unalterable laws which it can only enforce, has a greater appeal to he cultivated conscience of our times. Th e author refuses to be stampeded by transient moods and agitations of the time but approves of the principle that righteousness exalteth a nation. — <a title="Private" style="color: brown" href="https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/hfyvYGJZQiUwQaaxQO27q.html" target="_blank">S.
