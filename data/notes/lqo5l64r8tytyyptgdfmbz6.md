RAM is short for Random Access Memory, also referred to as volatile storage because it relies on a constant flow of electricity, when the power is turned off the contents of the RAM goes away.

More RAM doesn't always mean better performance.

- Parity uses a 9th error checking bit for every [[devlog.Byte]] of memory
- Non-parity = doesn't have a 9th parity bit

### Error correcting code

- Some RAMs also support ECC - Error correcting code
- Not only detects but also corrects common memory corruption issues
- Often supported on non-ECC motherboards
- Has to be enabled in [[devlog.bios]]/[[devlog.uefi]]

### SODIMM

- Stands for - Small Outline Dual In-line Memory Module
- Smaller RAM chips uses in laptops

### DDR RAM

- Stands for - Double data rate
- Determinded by the [[devlog.Motherboard]]
- Does _not_ have to be installed in pairs(as some of the older systems required)
- Variations include DDR2, DDR3, DDR4 (varies in throughput)
