"My formula for greatness in a human being is [Amor fati](#Amor%20fati): that one wants nothing to be different, not forward, not backward, not in all eternity. Not merely bear what is necessary, still less conceal it—all idealism is mendacity in the face of what is necessary—but love it." — "Why I Am So Clever" Ecce Homo, section 10. - [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]
