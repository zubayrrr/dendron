Peripheral cables provide wired connectivity solution for external devices that add functionality to a PC.

They come in a couple of differnet forms, whether we're talking about Peripheral and Network Cables:

- Standard cables contain one or more copper wires to transmit electricity.
- Fiber optic cables contain glass or plastic fibers to reflect light wavelengths.
- Cable length determines signal strength and quality, to rectify this, we use a repeater to make the signal strong again.

## Cable Transmission Types

#### Serial Transmission

- Transmits one bit at a time down the copper wire
- More common than parallel (older)
- Faster transmission rates
- Universal Serial Bus ([[USB]])
- Serial ATA([[SATA]])

#### Parallel Transmission

- Transmits multiple bits simultaneously through adjacent copper wires.
- Older cable type.
- Electrical signal interference from adjacent wires.
- Smaller transmission distance than Serial.

- [[devlog.SCSI]]

#### Video cables

- [[VGA]]
- Digital Video Interface, Video only DVI-D, DVI-A], DVI-I]
- [[DisplayPort]]
- [[HDMI]]

#### Mutlipurpose Cables

- [[Plenum]] cabling - used in and near air ventilation systems, if it burns it releases lowest amount of smoke/toxins.
- [[Non-Plenum]] cabling cannot be used in raised floors, ceilings or walls.
- Thunderbolt - supports both PCI Express + DisplayPort, allows device [[devlog.Daisy-Chaining]] such as monitors and storage drives.
- Lightning - Allows connectivity between Apple iOS devices and peripherals.
