<p>COMMON &#x26; BRAND NAMES Huasca; Yagé; Brew; Daime; The Tea; La Purga EFFECTS CLASSIFICATION Psychedelic CHEMICAL NAME Mixture DESCRIPTION Ayahuasca is a powerfully psychedelic South American brew traditionally made from the B. caapi vine and admixtures such as P. viridis (and/or other DMT-containing plants). One of its primary effects is considered to be the vomiting (the purge) that accompanies the experience. The term ayahuasca is sometimes loosely used to mean any combination of an <a href="/notes/0c73axilh1dhj6su9j0796q">MAOI</a> with <a href="/notes/imqb11ct7d2ln8uhklzdo3p">DMT</a>.</p>

<p>Traditionally, to make ayahuasca, the B. Caapi is mashed up into a pulp, and added to boiling water. The chacruna leaf is then added to the brew, in order to exert psychoactive effects. The ayahuasca brew leads to a psychedelic journey that lasts for around six hours.  — via <a href="https://psychedelicspotlight.com/what-is-changa/">What Is Changa?
