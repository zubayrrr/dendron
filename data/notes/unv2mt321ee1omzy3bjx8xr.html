<blockquote>
<p>What was observed by us in the third place is the nature or matter of the Milky Way itself, which, with the aid of the spyglass, may be observed so well that all the disputes that for so many generations have vexed philosophers are destroyed by visible crertainty, and we are liberated from wordy arguments.  For the Galaxy is nothing else than a congeries of innumerable stars distributed in clusters.  To whatever region of it you direct your spyglass, an immense number of stars immediately offer themselves to view, of which very many appear rather large and very conspicuous but the multitude of small ones is truly unfathomable.... â€” via <a href="http://faculty.humanities.uci.edu/bjbecker/exploringthecosmos/lecture7.html">Lecture 7</a></p>
