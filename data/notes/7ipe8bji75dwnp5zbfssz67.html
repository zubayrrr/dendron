<p>GraphX is Spark's own Graph Computation Engine and data store</p>
<p>Where data has some kind of networked connections, X connected to Y, Y connected to Z, Z connected to a and so on; making a relationship.</p>
<p>Where X Y Z are called Vertices, connections between vertices is called edges.</p>
<p>It could be used for networked devices, social media, cloud platform, different devices connected to each other.</p>
