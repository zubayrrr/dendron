Most people that claim that something is original are really just forgetting the references, inspirations to the original sources involved in the creation of that so called "original" work.

Nothing is completely original - and good artists understand this.

All creative works have built on what came before.

We need to accept this and embrace it instead of trying to burden ourselves from trying to create something "original" out of nothing.
