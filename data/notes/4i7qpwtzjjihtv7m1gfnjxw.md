State machine is a collection of states, each state will take input from the previous state and that state will send itâ€™s output to the next state.

AWS Step Functions lets us coordinate multiple AWS Services into [[devlog.serverless]] **workflows**. We can design and run workflows that stitch together services like [[devlog.AWS Lambda]], [[devlog.AWS Fargate]], [[devlog.AWS Sagemaker]] into feature rich applications.

- Configure: Define your workflow as a series of steps such as tasks, choices, parallel execution and timeouts.
- Populate: Connect tasks to code hosted in functions, instances and on-prem servers.
- Run: We provide any needed input and run your workflow as many times as needed for up to 1 year.
- Evolve: We can swap out tasks, change the order of steps or add new steps without changing code.

## Use cases

- Processes that extend beyond 15 minutes life of a [[devlog.AWS Lambda]] function.
- One function for one task.
- Business processes(user intervention).
- Parallel execution of Lambda functions.
