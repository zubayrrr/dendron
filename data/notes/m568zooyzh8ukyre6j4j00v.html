<p>The mile-high club is slang for the people who have had sexual intercourse on board an aircraft in flight.</p>
<p>An alleged explanation for wanting to perform the act is the supposed vibration of the plane. Some say they have fantasies about pilots or flight attendants, or a fetish about planes themselves, a type of mechanophilia. For others, the appeal of joining the mile-high club is the thrill of doing something taboo and the thrill of the risk of being discovered.</p>
