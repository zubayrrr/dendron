I’ve been tinkering with my Obsidian setup for months now, and it’s finally at a stage where I have something that (nearly) works. In the interest of ‘learning in public’, it felt like a great time to share.

## How Do I Use Obsidian?

Obsidian is where I:

- Capture the notes and highlights I make on various forms of input, for example, articles, tweets, academic papers and courses.
- Process those capture notes to generate ideas.
- Draft and finalise output, for example, articles, based on my ideas.
- Journal (my journal consists of a daily note and weekly and annual reviews linked to my goals and other notes in my system.

This article will focus on note-taking and note-making rather than journalling.

## What’s New?

The most significant changes are in my folder structure and tagging method. I have introduced a home page to act as a standard operating procedure (for myself) to ensure consistency in my approach. Also, I re-engineered my system to focus on input, action and output.

Incidentally, if you follow me on Twitter, you will be aware of my brief but passionate love affair with the Johnny Decimal system ([here’s the tweet](https://twitter.com/MartineGuernsey/status/1497225156284096521?s=20&t=L2Goq32PwZ_RjKW4v0fvhQ)). While I still think JD’s approach is fantastic for storage organisation (my Google Drive and iCloud are completely JohnnyDecimalised), it is not quite what I need for notes. My notes are a system, not a storage area. From my screenshots below, you will see that I have now moved towards a far shallower hierarchy with comparatively fewer folders.

Many of the changes I have introduced have been influenced by others, particularly [Danny Hatcher](https://www.youtube.com/dannyhatcher) (I watch all of his videos) and Elizabeth Butler (I love her [Calmer Notes](https://gumroad.com/a/500388979/VtAjF) approach). I must also mention my Twitter pal, Constantin, who wrote [a brilliant article](https://constantinluegering.de/johnny-decimal-is-a-great-guy-but-we-are-not-best-friends/) off the back of my original JD love tweet.

## Overarching System

The diagram below shows my overarching personal knowledge management system.

You can find links to all of the tools I use on the [Tools](https://www.martineellis.com/tools) page of my website (I update this regularly).

## How Does it Work?

Here is a screenshot of my new Home page — this outlines the critical elements of my system. Notice the emphasis on input, output and action (my tags).

I include all input and output tags on my New Input Note and New Output Note templates and delete those that do not apply when the template is loaded.

My New Input Note template looks like this:

My New Output Note template looks like this:

Crucially, I have ‘#wip’ and ‘#to-process’ tag searches starred and visible at all times. That way, they stay top of mind and do not get ignored.

And that folder structure? Here’s my Obsidian sidebar:

## Where are the Friction Points?

I have the Capture and Permanent aspects of my systems working well now, but I still capture far more than I create. In other words, there is way too much in the Capture area and not enough in Permanent. The reason for this is that I still have not finessed my Working process — this is when I take what I have captured and work on making it something of my own. That’s what I am developing next.

## What About You?

That’s it (as of March 2022), but I am sure there will be an update soon. Leave me a comment if you have questions or would like to grab a copy of any of my templates. Also, I’d love it if you shared your own systems with me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/MartineGuernsey). Let’s nerd out about PKM.
