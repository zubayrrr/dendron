### Practicals

- [Take it slow, at least the first 10 mins of your intercourse; Do not think about reaching an orgasm. Breath deeply. Relax. If you think you can't last 10 mins, just try barely moving at all inside your partner and breethe along.](https://youtu.be/gwBYzQE7rfk)
  - It should not be a means to an end. It'll allow you to come closer to your partner on a deeper level.

- [Self-pleasuring methods may not provide the same satisfaction as the real thing, but they provide just enough to placate the impulse to go meet these needs the healthy way.](https://www.welltechnically.news/p/sex-is-going-out-of-fashion)
- [Sex is going out of fashion. Pushed away by virtual imitations and decaff substitutes that, though nowhere near as gratifying as taking a real trip to pound town, are enough to pacify our sex drive in the convenience of a few left-handed clicks. Turns out that the human libido is much more delicate than we thought, so if you find yourself so overstimulated nothing turns you on anymore, the solution might be to turn everything off for a little while.](https://www.welltechnically.news/p/sex-is-going-out-of-fashion)

## Miscellaneous

> Retrograde ejaculation occurs when semen enters the bladder instead of emerging through the penis during orgasm. Although you still reach sexual climax, you might ejaculate very little or no semen. This is sometimes called a dry orgasm. Retrograde ejaculation isn't harmful, but it can cause male infertility. Treatment for retrograde ejaculation is generally only needed to restore fertility. â€” via [Retrograde ejaculation - Mayo Clinic](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/retrograde-ejaculation/symptoms-causes/syc-20354890)
