# Welcome to Noetic Noggin

This is [[my|archive.about]] personal wiki and a commonplace book; notes by me, for me.

ðŸš§ Permanently under construction ðŸš§

This wiki was made possible with [dendron.so](https://dendron.so) and [obisidian.md](https://obsidian.md). Stored on [Github Repository](https://github.com/zubayrrr/dendron) and hosted on [Netlify](https://netlify.com) for free.

## Principles

### All notes should be relative to me.

- All notes in principle are written for me; what I know about a subject, how I feel about a particular thing.
- Opinions are fine as long as I feel strong epistemic confidence in the given opinion.
- Don't over explain a note if it's not necessary, remember, these notes are for you and are relative to whatever knowledge you posses about the subject.
- Read books and make an dedicated notes for them.
- Listen podcasts but capture them inside a "subject specific" note or "Map of Concept" note or a note tagged #areas. Because making notes from podcasts can be tedious as they're not as well structured as books for consumption.(Whose merit is debatable.)
- #areas are basically "Map of Concept" notes but I have recently come to the realization that its better to maintain them [Nikita Voloboev style](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/) but with heavy usage of transclusion and backlinking.
  - "Resources" should be first processed and then mentioned inside the note, otherwise they should be left in inbox.

### Gotta capture 'em all

- Hog whatever information tickles your pickle([anything that gratifies one's intellectual curiosity](https://news.ycombinator.com/newsguidelines.html)).
- [[swipes]] are interesting/useful bits of... [[quotes|swipes.quotes]], [[excerpts|swipes.excerpts]], [[sayings|swipes.sayings]], [[phrases|swipes.phrases]]. Essentially, ideas, opinions that are swiped off from [[others|resources.people]].
- Make no distinction between "your" ideas and ideas of "others", because if you vibe with an idea; it's already yours.
- But also remember "If you've time to consume, you've time to produce.".
- Use [raindrop.io](https://raindrop.io) to manage your URL bookmarks.
- If you need to bookmark a webpage or an article all together, use [MarkDownload](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/markdownload-markdown-web/pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi?hl=en-GB) to rip the entire page. Let's call it a [[webmark|inbox.webmark]]; it belong in the `/inbox`.
- Similar process is employed for capturing tweets using [tweet-to-markdown](https://github.com/kbravh/tweet-to-markdown) and it also belongs in the `/inbox`.

### Don't force evolution

- Let your second brain evolve at it's own pace.
- The structure should never be _too_ rigid because its meant to take form by itself.

### Noise & Signal

- While capturing ideas left and right is recommended, make sure you're not harming your periods of focus.
- Have impenetrable focus periods (use Pomodoro method) where you only care about the work on hand and nothing else.

### Why do any of this?

- Because I can't remember everything - there's a lot of information around that interests me and there isn't enough working memory installed in me.
- So, I make notes - to remember, to create, to meditate, to think.
- A bodybuilder's portfolio is their body - my portfolio is my wiki.
- Not only am I making - whatever I know - tangible by writing it down. I know exactly where to look if I ever forget something.
- I am at the beginning of my learning adventures. When I look back at it, I will know where I came from and how my thoughts evolved over time.
- Plus, its really fun to nerd out.

## Structure of this wiki

- [[slipbox.Ontology]] explains the structure of this wiki and the tags, backlinks used in it.
- Dendron takes care of the structure and hierarchy(mostly), but I insist on using tags for backwards compatibility.
