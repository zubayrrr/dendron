Container Orchestration tools exist to make your life easier by giving you a way for managing, scaling and deploying containers.

Suppose you've a bunch of containers deployed on [[devlog.AWS EC2]] instances, can you answer how are you going to accomplish the following this?:

- How do you know how much resource is still available?
- Where to schedule next container?
- Have any containers crashed?
- Setting up load balancing
- How to compare actual and desired state?

Following are some of the Container Orchestration tools that you can use:

- [[devlog.Kubernetes]]
- [[devlog.Mesos]]
- [[devlog.docker swarm]]
