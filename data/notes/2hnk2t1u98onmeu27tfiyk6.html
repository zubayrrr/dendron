<p><strong>Thomas Midgley Jr.</strong> (May 18, 1889 – November 2, 1944) was an American mechanical and chemical engineer. He played a major role in developing leaded gasoline (tetraethyllead) and some of the first chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), better known in the United States by the brand name Freon; both products were later banned from common use due to their harmful impact on human health and the environment. He was granted more than 100 patents over the course of his career.The New Scientist called him a "one-man environmental disaster". </p>

<p>Midgley's legacy has been scarred by the negative environmental impact of leaded gasoline and Freon. Environmental historian J. R. McNeill opined that Midgley "had more adverse impact on the atmosphere than any other single organism in Earth's history", and Bill Bryson remarked that Midgley possessed "an instinct for the regrettable that was almost uncanny".[26]</p>
<p>Use of leaded gasoline, which he invented, released large quantities of lead into the atmosphere all over the world.[24] High atmospheric lead levels have been linked with serious long-term health problems from childhood, including neurological impairment and with increased levels of violence and criminality in America and around the world. Time magazine included both leaded gasoline and CFCs on its list of "The 50 Worst Inventions".</p>
<p>Midgley died three decades before the ozone-depleting and greenhouse gas effects of CFCs in the atmosphere became widely known. In 1987, the Montreal Protocol phased out the use of CFCs like Freon. Some consider Midgley’s legacy one of death and destruction from which we will not soon recover. </p>
