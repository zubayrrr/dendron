In knot theory, a branch of mathematics, the **Trefoil knot** is the simplest example of a nontrivial knot. The trefoil can be obtained by joining together the two loose ends of a common overhand knot, resulting in a knotted loop. As the simplest knot, the trefoil is fundamental to the study of mathematical knot theory.The trefoil knot is named after the three-leaf clover (or trefoil) plant.
