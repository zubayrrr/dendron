A Hub is an older technology that connects network devices together (such as [[devlog.Client]] and [[devlog.Server]]).

A hub is a physical layer networking device which is used to connect multiple devices in a network. They are generally used to connect computers in a LAN. Creating a [[devlog.Daisy-Chaining]] effect.

Hubs can lead to increased network errors.

A hub received information in one port and rebroadcasts it out all the other ports.
