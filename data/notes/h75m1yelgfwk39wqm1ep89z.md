## Classless Interdomain Routing (CIDR)

CIDR is a notation for describing blocks of IP addresses and is used heavily in various networking configurations. IP addresses contain 4 octets, each consisting of 8 bits giving values between 0 and 255. The decimal value that comes after the slash is the number of bits consisting of the routing prefix. This in turn can be translated into a netmask, and also designates how many available addresses are in the block.

Sometimes we want to vary the length of our subnet masks and we donâ€™t want to stick to the standard classes so we use CIDR. It helps optimize the IP space. It uses variable length subnet mask(VLSM).

CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) -- also known as supernetting -- is a method of assigning Internet Protocol (IP) addresses that improves the efficiency of address distribution and replaces the previous system based on Class A, Class B and Class C networks.
