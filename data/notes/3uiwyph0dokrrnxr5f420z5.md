- Patch Panels are devices with jacks to connect wiring from the jack to a network [[devlog.Switch]] in a flexible manner.
- On the back of these patch panels there are [[Punch Down Blocks]], looks like a 110 Block.
- On the front of the patch panel looks like a network jack, [[devlog.RJ-45]] jacks.
- Patch panels are cheap and should be used as an intermediary between a plug and [[devlog.Switch]] to avoid damage to the Switch.
