<p>Cloud can be loosely defined as "Someone else's computer"</p>
<p>Cloud is a collection of services that create a platform which include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Media Services</li>
<li>Databases</li>
<li>Security</li>
<li>Virtual Servers</li>
<li>Networking</li>
<li>Data Storage</li>
<li>Machine Learning</li>

</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p>These services come with a specific feature set aimed at making an organization's life easier by hosting these services for them in remotely.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can choose where in the world you want to run these services, access them remotely and fine tune them to your requirements.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Saving the organization a lot of money had they hosted these services themselves.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="/notes/gvpkbgglehtr9ej5e0uj44j">AWS</a> has over 200 services.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pay-as-you-go pricing:</p>
<ul>
<li>Billed by the second for using services</li>
<li>60 second minimum</li>
<li>Use 83 seconds and get charged for only 83 s</li>

<ul>
<li>AWS has regions, physical locations around the world where they put their data centers which have the servers that host their services.</li>
<li>Currently AWS has regions in North America, South America, Europe, the Middle East, Africa and the Asia Pacific.</li>
<li>Inside regions we've availability zones, each region has isolated and multiple availability zones in geographic area, they all have their own power, security and they're all connected to each other via redundant, ultra high speed, and low latency networks.</li>
<li>Availability zone names are randomly generated for each AWS user, example: what could be ap-southeast-2a for you will be something else for another user, like ap-southeast-2c, this is done to ensure people utilize all of their availability zones.</li>
<li>This is also done for redundancy, so that if a problem occurs at one data center, you will not be effected by it. To avoid a single point of failure. Its unlikely all of their availability zones will be hit by power cut or other such infrastructure issues.</li>
