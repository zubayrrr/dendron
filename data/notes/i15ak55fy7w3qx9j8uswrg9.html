<p>All happy families are alike, but every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way (Leo Tolstoy, Anna Karenina, 1878)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At the opening of his novel Anna Karenina, the Russian novelist Tolstoy writes ‘All Happy families resemble one another, but each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.’</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>By this he seems to be suggesting that if a family is happy, there is nothing particularly interesting or insightful to observe about them. On the other hand, families that fail to thrive as a unit all have unique stories behind their struggles. He then goes on to illustrate this in his novel. But is the quotation true and what if anything might we learn from it?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Implicit in this quotation lies something of the belief that happy families are simple and really rather boring whereas the unhappiness of a family is a marker of complexity, depth and therefore far more interesting. The same trope is evident in the belief that a truly great artist should be a ‘tortured’ soul. While of course misery may lead to greater understanding and enlightenment, it may only lead to wallowing in self-pity and greater unhappiness. — via <a href="https://wychwoodschool.org/blogs/all-happy-families-are-alike/">All happy families are alike, but every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way (Leo Tolstoy, Anna Karenina, 1878) | Wychwood School</a></p>
