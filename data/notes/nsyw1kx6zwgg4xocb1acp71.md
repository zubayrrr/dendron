A Frankfurter is a thin parboiled sausage made of pure pork in a casing of sheep's intestine. The taste is acquired by a method of low temperature smoking. For consumption, occasionally Frankfurters are not cooked; they are heated in hot water for only about eight minutes to prevent the skin from bursting.
