<p><code>patch</code> is a command that takes the output from the <a href="/notes/8jubll0iaagwha7xjx7kozh">diff</a> and puts it into a file. Then, it can take the filed output and overwrite another file with with the changes. For example, a common use is to use the patch to transfer changes from the changed file to the original file, thus making them identical. While this can also be accomplished by copy/pasting the updated file into the original file, patch is much faster and efficient.</p>
<ul>
<li>-b Creates a backup of the original file</li>
<li>-i Forces the command to read the patch from the .patch file instead of from standard input</li>
<li>-p[#] Instructs the command to strip # number of slashes from the filepath to the filename. You’ll see in most of our examples, we use -p0 so that no slashes are stripped away</li>
<li>-R Reverses the previous patch</li>
<li>-s Runs the command silently. It will only show process if there are errors</li>
</ul>

<p>Example scenario:</p>
<p>Suppose a new bug was discovered that needed to be patched, the developer needs to make changes to the source code, instead of releasing a completely new program, the developer instead releases a <code>patch file</code> that contains difference (<a href="/notes/8jubll0iaagwha7xjx7kozh">diff</a>) for that file that contains the bug and what changes are needed to be made to make the bug go away.</p>
<p>This <code>patch file</code> was generated by the <a href="/notes/8jubll0iaagwha7xjx7kozh">diff</a> command by comparing the source files of the bugged program and the rectified program. The patch can now be applied to the bugged program using the patch tool.</p>
