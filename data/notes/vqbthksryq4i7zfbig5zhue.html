On criminal side, the lowest court is that of the Judicial Magistrate 1st class. Civil Judge (Junior Division) decides civil cases of small pecuniary stake. Judicial Magistrates decide criminal cases, which are punishable with imprisonment of up to three year. At the middle of the hierarchy, there is the Court of Civil Judge (Senior Division) on the civil side and the Court of the Chief Judicial Magistrate on the Criminal side. Civil Judge (senior division) can decide civil cases of any valuation. – via <a href="https://districts.ecourts.gov.in/node/149621">districts.ecourts.gov.in</a></p>
