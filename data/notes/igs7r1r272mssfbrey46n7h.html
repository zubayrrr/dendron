<p>The primary purpose of groups is to define a set of privilages or permissions like read, write or execute for a given file that can be shared among users within the group.</p>
<p>There are two types of groups that a user can belong to:</p>
<ul>
<li>1. The primary group: The ID is stored in <code>/etc/passwd</code> and the group name in <code>/etc/group</code>
<ul>
<li>When a user creates a file the user will be the owner of the file and its primary group will be the group owner of the file. (in Linux a file is owned both by a group and a user)</li>
<li>Each user should belong to exactly one primary group (usually the name of the group is same as the username and no other user would be part of this group)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>2. The secondary group: stored in <code>/etc/group</code>
<ul>
<li>A user can belong to none or many secondary or supplementary groups.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><code>grep 'userName' /etc/passwd</code>
<ul>
<li>Third field indicates the user ID, fourth indicates the primary group ID</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>grep 'groupID' /etc/group</code></li>
<li>To search for secondary groups that a user belongs to, type for <code>/username</code> after <code>less /etc/group</code>
<ul>
<li>If there are multiple users belonging to a secondary group, they'll be separated by a comma.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>You can also use the <a title="Private" style="color: brown" href="https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/hfyvYGJZQiUwQaaxQO27q.html" target="_blank">id (Private)</a> command to get info about the groups and their IDs the current user belongs to.</li>
