<li>YARN is the main job scheduler and resource allocator for the entire <a href="/notes/85w31vcdf3bjnm0yxh72ygf">Hadoop</a> cluster. User applications request resoruces from YARN(contains with data locality).</li>
<li>Resources can include cores, memory, GPUs, software licenses and data.</li>
<li>Suppose you've a cluster of 10 machines and 50 users and they want to use certain amount of cores and other resources in general, YARN will setup a queue and depending on the policy on the site, jobs get submitted to the queue and YARN will determine when they'll run based on the policy and availability of resources.</li>
<li>Each user application is managed at run-time by an ApplicationMaster (AM) container and is responsible for requesting further containers for jobs that are part of the application.</li>
<li>AM is basically a localised resource manager for the application that can adapt at run-time for the resources as available.</li>
<li>AM manages dynamic resource allocation at run-time. In other words, the <strong>number of mapper processes is usually the number of reducers</strong>.</li>
<li>From the cluster view: there is one main ResourceManager and multiple NodeManagers.</li>
