<blockquote>
<p>A nickname for corn based "pornography," usually for those with a corn fetish.
Usually contains heavy amounts of corn, however it isn't anything like standard porn, as it only includes high quality images / videos that have to do entirely with corn. Also can include corn being slowly cooked, or with corn being topped with melting butter. Usually doesn't include humans at all. â€” via <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=cornography">Urban Dictionary: cornography</a></p>
