<p>Warts are a type of skin infection caused by the human papillomavirus (HPV). The infection causes rough, skin-colored bumps to form on the skin. The virus is contagious. You can get warts from touching someone who has them. Warts most commonly appear on the hands, but they can also affect the feet, face, genitals and knees.â€”via <a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/15045-warts">Warts: HPV, Causes, Types, Treatments, Removal, Prevention</a></p>
