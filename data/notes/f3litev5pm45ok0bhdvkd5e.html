<blockquote>
<p>I thought the earth<br>
remembered me, she<br>
took me back so tenderly, arranging
her dark skirts, her pockets<br>
full of lichens and seeds. I slept<br>
as never before, a stone<br>
on the riverbed, nothing<br>
between me and the white fire of the stars<br>
but my thoughts, and they floated<br>
light as moths among the branches<br>
of the perfect trees. All night<br>
I heard the small kingdoms breathing<br>
around me, the insects, and the birds<br>
who do their work in the darkness. All night<br>
I rose and fell, as if in water, grappling<br>
with a luminous doom. By morning<br>
I had vanished at least a dozen times<br>
into something better.</p>
