<p>IT service management -- often referred to as ITSM -- is simply how IT teams manage the end-to-end delivery of IT services to customers. This includes all the processes and activities to design, create, deliver, and support IT services.</p>
<p>The core concept of ITSM is the belief that IT should be delivered as a service. A typical ITSM scenario could involve asking for new hardware like a laptop. You would submit your request through a portal, filling out a ticket with all relevant information, and kicking off a repeatable workflow. Then, the ticket would land in the IT teamâ€™s queue, where incoming requests are sorted and addressed according to importance.</p>

<p>ITIL (Information Technology Infrastructure Library) is a widely accepted set of best practices that is designed to support an organization in gaining optimal value from IT by aligning IT services with business strategy.</p>
<p>ITIL was created with ITSM in mind. But the distinction between the two can be boiled down to one idea: ITIL is a framework or a set of guidelines to assist in implementing the activities involved in ITSM.</p>

<p>Difference between ITSM and ITIL is akin to the one between <a href="/notes/2ue4z8394yvhc6c6w4g0rjy">Agile and Scrum</a>. While ITSM (or Agile) is a methodology, ITIL (or Scrum) is a framework for implementing that methodology.</p>
