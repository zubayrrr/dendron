<p>Kops is short for <a href="/notes/gbeh61d6hvbmxxy63chp81b">Kubernetes</a> Operations (also spelled kops or kOps), a set of tools AWS offers for installing, operating, and deleting Kubernetes clusters.</p>
<p>You can also use it to roll out an upgrade of an older version of Kubernetes to a new one and manage cluster add-ons. After creating a cluster, you can use the usual kubectl CLI to manage resources.</p>
<p>To quote the documentation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>kops will not only help you create, destroy, upgrade and maintain production-grade, highly available, Kubernetes cluster, but it will also provision the necessary cloud infrastructure.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Key features of Kops:</p>
<ul>
<li>Kops simplifies Kubernetes cluster setup and management, especially in comparison to the amount of effort needed to manually set up master and worker nodes.</li>
<li>It automates the provisioning of Highly Available Kubernetes clusters.</li>
<li>The tool manages Route53, AutoScaling Groups, ELBs for many different tasks from master and node bootstrapping to the API server and rolling updates to your cluster.</li>
<li>It’s multi-architecture ready and supports ARM64.</li>
<li>It supports multiple cloud platforms, which makes it a better choice if you’re afraid of getting locked into a specific Kubernetes offering.</li>
<li>It’s an open-source tool, so you can use it for free. However, you still need to pay for and maintain the underlying infrastructure created by Kops to manage your cluster.</li>
</ul>

<p>Kops does the job much faster. It’s a CLI tool you need to install on your local machine together with kubectl. To get a cluster running, use the Kops create cluster command. The great thing about Kops is that it manages most of the AWS resources you need for your Kubernetes cluster.</p>
<p>Contrary to EKS, Kops creates master nodes as EC2 instances – you can always access them directly to make modifications around the networking layer, size, etc. You can monitor these nodes directly too.</p>
<p>Kops lets you create a cluster really fast, but managing it is more complicated. There’s much groundwork to cover for upgrading and replacing master nodes for new Kubernetes versions. Creating a new cluster in a new VPC with Kops might be easier than that.
When it comes to maintenance tasks like adding, replacing, and upgrading worker nodes, Kops performs quite similarly to <a href="/notes/ervusa6qabwyx7sbb1a4vcg">AWS EKS</a>. AutoScaling Groups come in handy here.</p>
