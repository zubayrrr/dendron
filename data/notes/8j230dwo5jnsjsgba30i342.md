IPFIX is an acronym that stands for IP Flow Information Export. IPFIX is a protocol designed for collection and analysis of flow data from supported network devices.

Twas created as a more universal solution to collecting and analyzing vital network data. And while IPFIX works with Cisco, it can also include a much wider range of vendor products and devices. This makes IPFIX a popular alternative to [[devlog.NetFlow]] for organizations that need an effective traffic-analysis solution for non-Cisco devices.
