- [[devlog.Hub]]s were used to connect multiple network segments together
- Each [[devlog.LAN]] segment becomes a separate [[devlog.Collision Domains]]
- As the network gets larger in which a [[devlog.Hub]] is being utilized to connect all the machines, the network will get more chaotic as [[devlog.Hub]] don't break up [[devlog.Collision Domains]], it'll be treated as one large collision domain.
- To deal with this issue a [[devlog.Bridge]] needs to be introduced to the network.
