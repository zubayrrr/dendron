OSI stands for Open Systems Interconnection, developed in 1977 by the International Organization for Standardization(ISO).

- ISO 7498 is for the standard, OSI model.
- OSI Model can also be referred to as OSI Stack.

OSI model doesn't always accurately describe how networks actually operate (some things can operate at multiple layers of the OSI model), our networks today operate on the [[devlog.tcp‚ÅÑip model]] model but OSI model was the standard to describe how all and any network can possibly operate.

OSI model serves as a reference model:

- To categorize functions of the network into particular layer(s).
- To compare technologies across different manufacturers.
- To understand how to best communicate with that device, how to troubleshoot it etc.

The OSI model has 7 layers:
| Group | # | Layer Name | Key Responsibilities | Data Type Handled | Scope | Common Protocols and Technologies |
|--------------|---|--------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Lower Layers | 1 | Physical | Encoding and Signaling; Physical Data Transmission; Hardware Specifications; Topology and Design | Bits | Electrical or light signals sent between local devices | (Physical layers of most of the technologies listed for the data link layer) |
| Lower Layers | 2 | Data Link | Logical Link Control; Media Access Control; Data Framing; Addressing; Error Detection and Handling; Defining Requirements of Physical Layer | Frames | Low-level data messages between local devices | IEEE 802.2 LLC, Ethernet Family; Token Ring; FDDI and CDDI; IEEE 802.11 (WLAN, Wi-Fi); HomePNA; HomeRF; ATM; SLIP and PPP |
| Lower Layers | 3 | Network | Logical Addressing; Routing; Datagram Encapsulation; Fragmentation and Reassembly; Error Handling and Diagnostics | Datagrams / Packets | Messages between local or remote devices | IP; IPv6; IP NAT; IPsec; Mobile IP; ICMP; IPX; DLC; PLP; Routing protocols such as RIP and BGP |
| Lower Layers | 4 | Transport | Process-Level Addressing; Multiplexing/Demultiplexing; Connections; Segmentation and Reassembly; Acknowledgments and Retransmissions; Flow Control | Datagrams / Segments / Packets | Communication between software processes | TCP and UDP; SPX; NetBEUI/NBF |
| Upper Layers | 5 | Session | Session Establishment, Management and Termination | Sessions | Sessions between local or remote devices | NetBIOS, Sockets, Named Pipes, RPC |
| Upper Layers | 6 | Presentation | Data Translation; Compression and Encryption | Encoded User **D**ata | Application data representations | SSL; Shells and Redirectors; MIME |
| Upper Layers | 7 | Application | User Application Services | User **D**ata | Application data | DNS; NFS; BOOTP; DHCP; SNMP; RMON; FTP; TFTP; SMTP; POP3; IMAP; NNTP; HTTP; Telnet |

The mnemonic we can use to remember is: "**P**lease **D**o **N**ot **T**hrow **S**ausage **P**izza **A**way\!"

At different layers, data/information is called by different names.

The mnemonic to remember the data types in the OSI model is: "**D**on't **S**ome **P**eople **F**orget **B**irthdays?"
