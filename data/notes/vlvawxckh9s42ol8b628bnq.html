<p>The Pareto principle states that for many outcomes, roughly 80% of consequences come from 20% of causes (the "vital few"). Other names for this principle are the 80/20 rule, the law of the vital few, or the principle of factor sparsity.</p>
<p>Management consultant Joseph M. Juran developed the concept in the context of quality control and improvement after reading the works of Italian economist Vilfredo Pareto, who noted the 80/20 connection while at the University of Lausanne. In his first work, Cours d'Ã©conomie politique, Pareto showed that approximately 80% of the land in Italy was owned by 20% of the population. The Pareto principle is only tangentially related to Pareto efficiency.</p>
