<li>Every generation has a "monoculture" of sorts, a governing pattern of system of beliefs that everybody(most people of that gen) has accepted to be objective "truth".</li>
<li>It is not necessary for this "monoculture" to align perfectly with reality of whatever time period this "monoculture" is from. (basically this monoculture is not really <em>the</em> truth, just something commonly accepted by a generation).</li>
<li>The objectivity required to see the difference between a monoculture and the reality is hard to develop. Because once you are deely ingrained with an idea, when you've accepted it as <em>the</em> truth, it becomes hard to see it as "subjective".</li>
<li>Much of our inner turmoil is the result of conducting a life that contradicts with our inner narrative of whats "normal" and "ideal", trying to live a life we don't inherently desire. We keep trying to fight with with "how" we're living our lives with "how we shoul be" living our lives (ideals that represent the monoculture).</li>
<li>The fundamentals of any monoculture tend to surround what we should be living for and working towards, here are 8 of such pervasive fundamental beliefs that our current system has for us.</li>
<li>You believe that creating your best life is a matter of deciding what you want and then going after it, but in reality, you are psychologically incapable of being able to predict what will make you happy</li>
