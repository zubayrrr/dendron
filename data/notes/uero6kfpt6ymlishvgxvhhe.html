<p>Ssh-keygen is a tool for creating new authentication key pairs for SSH. Such key pairs are used for automating logins, single sign-on, and for authenticating hosts.</p>
<p>The <a href="/notes/o922t6d9q6wur3yve290hir">SSH</a> protocol uses public key cryptography for authenticating hosts and users. The authentication keys, called SSH keys, are created using the keygen program.</p>
<p>SSH supports several public key algorithms for authentication keys. These include:</p>
<p>rsa - an old algorithm based on the difficulty of factoring large numbers. A key size of at least 2048 bits is recommended for RSA; 4096 bits is better. RSA is getting old and significant advances are being made in factoring. Choosing a different algorithm may be advisable. It is quite possible the RSA algorithm will become practically breakable in the foreseeable future. All SSH clients support this algorithm.</p>
<p>dsa - an old US government Digital Signature Algorithm. It is based on the difficulty of computing discrete logarithms. A key size of 1024 would normally be used with it. DSA in its original form is no longer recommended.</p>
<p>ecdsa - a new Digital Signature Algorithm standarized by the US government, using elliptic curves. This is probably a good algorithm for current applications. Only three key sizes are supported: 256, 384, and 521 (sic!) bits. We would recommend always using it with 521 bits, since the keys are still small and probably more secure than the smaller keys (even though they should be safe as well). Most SSH clients now support this algorithm.</p>
<p>ed25519 - this is a new algorithm added in OpenSSH. Support for it in clients is not yet universal. Thus its use in general purpose applications may not yet be advisable.</p>
<p>The algorithm is selected using the -t option and key size using the -b option. -c "Comment" to add/update the comment for a keyfile.</p>

<p><code>ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048 -C "Key generated for remote machine on date"</code></p>
<p>The private and the public key can be found inside the <code>.ssh</code> dir of the user's home dir.</p>
<p>You'll need to add the public key(<code>.pub</code>) to the remote machine.</p>

<p>Running <code>ssh-copy-id root@ip-addr</code> will append the public key to the remote machine's authorized keys(<code>.ssh/authorized_keys</code>)</p>
