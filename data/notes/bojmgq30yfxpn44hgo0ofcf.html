<p>Spark has a DAG scheduler in the background which is tracking the transformations and steps which is part of your applications.</p>
<p>It is the scheduling layer of the Spark Architecture that implements stage-oriented scheduling and eliminates that hadoop <a href="/notes/j6kfx6ziqg91r356nur9cwy">MapReduce</a> multistage execution model.</p>
<p>If you're processing data using Spark applications in a Spark platform(whether standalone or in a hadoop cluster), for every step you do as part of your application, it creates an <a href="/notes/2vn2g9mhmi624b83rl5se0k">RDD</a>, it becomes part of your DAG. The DAG scheduler is already aware of what steps are involved in DAG hence it comes up with a plan for executing the all the steps within the DAG. <span class="underline">If only and only if an action is invoked.</span></p>
