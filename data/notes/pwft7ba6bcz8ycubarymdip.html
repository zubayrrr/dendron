<p>The Mandela Effect is defined as a commonly held false memory. In the field of psychology, the term “false memory” is applied to anything that a person remembers incorrectly or inaccurately. As such, the term “Mandela Effect” is defined as a false yet widely held recollection.</p>
<p>The name was coined after political leader Nelson Mandela’s death in 2013. Countless people swore he died when he was held prisoner in the 1980s and distinctly remember news coverage of the funeral.</p>
