— Dr. Krashen</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Sentence mining</strong></p>\n<p>Sentence mining is about gathering up example sentences and studying them. More specifically, the idea of sentence mining encourages you to focus on sentences as your primary learning material instead of words, lessons or other units of learning.</p>\n<p>When studying vocabulary, you use full sentences that contain that vocabulary. Ideally you use several different sentences that all cover the same vocabulary to build a better mental model of how those words behave in the language.</p>\n<p>Sentence mining is such an effective technique because it recognises the holistic nature of languages as a form of knowledge.</p>\n<p>When you learn with sentences, you're getting a series of complete learning packages. Sentences demonstrate the associations between the words they contain (collocation), they show how the words relate to the grammar and structure of the sentence, and they dramatically increase your opportunities to link your language knowledge together.</p>\n<p>Via - <a href=\"https://www.chineseboost.com/blog/sentence-mining/\">Sentence mining | Chinese Boost | Learn Chinese</a></p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>We learn best through compelling, comprehensible input</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Compelling</strong> — What I learn must be interesting and relevant to me, or else I’ll quit.</li>\n<li><strong>Comprehensible</strong> — I must understand (not 100%, but the main idea), or else the language is nonsense, and I’ll quit. I can use context and my previous experiences to help me understand.</li>\n<li><strong>Input</strong> — I learn best through stories. Facts are boring. The key is to listen and read things I care about. Memorizing grammar rules and vocabulary isn’t effective.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Accents depend on emotions</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Studying a language doesn’t work, acquiring does</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“We acquire language in only one way. When we understand what people say and when we understand what we read.</p>\n<p>If you do that, all the grammar and vocabulary you’re ready to acquire is there, and little by little, it’s absorbed.</p>\n<p>The ability to speak is the result of listening, the result of reading.</p>\n<p>Study doesn’t help you very much.</p>\n<p>Memorizing vocabulary rules, vocabulary… studying grammar… if you want to get better at another language, listen and read.</p>\n<p>Find things you’re really interested in, where you’re excited to know what’s going to happen next, and be patient, it comes over time.</p>\n<p>We are born to acquire language. That’s the way our brains are.”</p>\n<p>— Dr. Krashen</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>Do more reps. Reps are practice.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Via - <a href=\"https://medium.com/learning-languages/dr-stephen-krashen-on-language-learning-and-acquisition-notes-47b6757ebc01\">Dr. Stephen Krashen on Languages | Learning Languages</a></p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"spotlight-vs-floodlight-learning\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading\" href=\"#spotlight-vs-floodlight-learning\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\"><use xlink:href=\"#svg-link\"></use></svg></a>Spotlight VS Floodlight learning</h2>\n<p>At a personal, organizational, and societal level, we tend to focus on and value “spotlight” learning much more highly than “floodlight” learning.  The spotlight perspective dominates the world of degrees, certifications, and even much of the self-help literature that claims to carve out alternate paths.  There’s nothing surprising or even necessarily wrong with the bias towards the spotlight – things tend to be easier to see, understand, and manage in the spotlight.</p>\n<p>But being aware of and regularly tuning into floodlight learning is increasingly important in a world where we are bombarded daily with information and influences, where we have a bewildering array of choices about how and with whom we interact (for example, in social networks).  So much of learning is driven by context and circumstances – whether we choose them or they are thrust upon us, but we don’t often think critically about our context and circumstances.  We often learn on “auto-pilot” – not unlike how we often drive on auto-pilot. That may be fine, in most cases, but among other possible dangers it can cause us to gravitate  toward what is familiar, comfortable, easy – towards a state in which little significant learning is happening at all.</p>\n<p>Focus, concentrate, set goals – let your spotlight shine bright. But occasionally peer out into the floodlight and make sure you like what you see. — via <a href=\"https://www.missiontolearn.com/spotlight-floodlight-alan-watts/\">How does your learning light shine?

Welcome to Noetic Noggin\n\nThis is [[my|archive.about]] personal wiki and a commonplace book; notes by me, for me.\n\n🚧 Permanently under construction 🚧\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/zubayr/image/upload/v1658499909/wiki/ajevkuyebljlxiblyst2.png)\n\nThis wiki was made possible with [dendron.so](https://dendron.so) and [obisidian.md](https://obsidian.md). Stored on [Github Repository](https://github.com/zubayrrr/dendron) and hosted on [Netlify](https://netlify.com) for free.\n\n## Principles\n\n### All notes should be relative to me.\n\n- All notes in principle are written for me; what I know about a subject, how I feel about a particular thing.\n- Opinions are fine as long as I feel strong epistemic confidence in the given opinion.\n- Don't over explain a note if it's not necessary, remember, these notes are for you and are relative to whatever knowledge you posses about the subject.\n- Read books and make an dedicated notes for them.\n- Listen podcasts but capture them inside a \"subject specific\" note or \"Map of Concept\" note or a note tagged #areas. Because making notes from podcasts can be tedious as they're not as well structured as books for consumption.(Whose merit is debatable.)\n- #areas are basically \"Map of Concept\" notes but I have recently come to the realization that its better to maintain them [Nikita Voloboev style](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/) but with heavy usage of transclusion and backlinking.\n  - \"Resources\" should be first processed and then mentioned inside the note, otherwise they should be left in inbox.\n\n### Gotta capture 'em all\n\n- Hog whatever information tickles your pickle([anything that gratifies one's intellectual curiosity](https://news.ycombinator.com/newsguidelines.html)).\n- [[swipes]] are interesting/useful bits of... [[quotes|swipes.quotes]], [[excerpts|swipes.excerpts]], [[sayings|swipes.sayings]], [[phrases|swipes.phrases]]. Essentially, ideas, opinions that are swiped off from [[others|resources.people]].\n- Make no distinction between \"your\" ideas and ideas of \"others\", because if you vibe with an idea; it's already yours.\n- But also remember \"If you've time to consume, you've time to produce.\".\n- Use [raindrop.io](https://raindrop.io) to manage your URL bookmarks.\n- If you need to bookmark a webpage or an article all together, use [MarkDownload](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/markdownload-markdown-web/pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi?hl=en-GB) to rip the entire page. Let's call it a [[webmark|inbox.webmark]]; it belong in the `/inbox`.\n- Similar process is employed for capturing tweets using [tweet-to-markdown](https://github.com/kbravh/tweet-to-markdown) and it also belongs in the `/inbox`.\n\n### Don't force evolution\n\n- Let your second brain evolve at it's own pace.\n- The structure should never be _too_ rigid because its meant to take form by itself.\n\n### Noise & Signal\n\n- While capturing ideas left and right is recommended, make sure you're not harming your periods of focus.\n- Have impenetrable focus periods (use Pomodoro method) where you only care about the work on hand and nothing else.\n\n### Why do any of this?\n\n- Because I can't remember everything - there's a lot of information around that interests me and there isn't enough working memory installed in me.\n- So, I make notes - to remember, to create, to meditate, to think.\n- A bodybuilder's portfolio is their body - my portfolio is my wiki.\n- Not only am I making - whatever I know - tangible by writing it down. I know exactly where to look if I ever forget something.\n- I am at the beginning of my learning adventures. When I look back at it, I will know where I came from and how my thoughts evolved over time.\n- Plus, its really fun to nerd out.\n\n## Structure of this wiki\n\n- [[slipbox.Ontology]] explains the structure of this wiki and the tags, backlinks used in it.\n- Dendron takes care of the structure and hierarchy(mostly), but I insist on using tags for backwards compatibility.\n\n## Quicklinks\n\n- [[About me|archive.about]]\n- [Github](https://github.com/zubayrrr)\n- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/zoobhalu)\n- [Blog](https://zubayrali.in)\n- [Guestbook](https://www.yourworldoftext.com/~zubayrali/)\n"},"collectionChildren":null,"customHeadContent":null,"config":{"version":5,"dev":{"enablePreviewV2":true,"enableSelfContainedVaults":true},"commands":{"lookup":{"note":{"selectionMode":"extract","confirmVaultOnCreate":true,"vaultSelectionModeOnCreate":"smart","leaveTrace":false,"bubbleUpCreateNew":true,"fuzzThreshold":0.2}},"randomNote":{},"insertNoteLink":{"aliasMode":"none","enableMultiSelect":false},"insertNoteIndex":{"enableMarker":false},"copyNoteLink":{},"templateHierarchy":"template","insertNote":{"initialValue":"templates"}},"workspace":{"vaults":[{"fsPath":".","selfContained":true,"name":"Dendron"}],"journal":{"dailyDomain":"daily","name":"journal","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd","addBehavior":"childOfDomain"},"scratch":{"name":"scratch","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd.HHmmss","addBehavior":"asOwnDomain"},"task":{"name":"task","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd","addBehavior":"asOwnDomain","statusSymbols":{"":" ","wip":"w","done":"x","assigned":"a","moved":"m","blocked":"b","delegated":"l","dropped":"d","pending":"y"},"taskCompleteStatus":["done","x"],"prioritySymbols":{"H":"high","M":"medium","L":"low"},"todoIntegration":false,"createTaskSelectionType":"selection2link"},"graph":{"zoomSpeed":1,"createStub":false},"enableAutoCreateOnDefinition":false,"enableHandlebarTemplates":true,"enableXVaultWikiLink":false,"enableRemoteVaultInit":true,"enableUserTags":true,"enableHashTags":true,"workspaceVaultSyncMode":"noCommit","enableAutoFoldFrontmatter":false,"enableEditorDecorations":true,"maxPreviewsCached":10,"maxNoteLength":204800,"enableFullHierarchyNoteTitle":false,"enableSmartRefs":true},"preview":{"enableFMTitle":true,"enableNoteTitleForLink":true,"enableFrontmatterTags":true,"enableHashesForFMTags":false,"enableMermaid":true,"enablePrettyRefs":true,"enableKatex":true,"automaticallyShowPreview":false},"publishing":{"theme":"dark","enableFMTitle":true,"enableNoteTitleForLink":true,"enableMermaid":true,"enablePrettyRefs":true,"enableKatex":true,"copyAssets":true,"siteHierarchies":["root"],"writeStubs":false,"siteRootDir":"docs","seo":{"title":"Noetic Noggin","description":"Personal Wiki / Digital Garden","author":"Zubayr Ali","twitter":"zoobhalu"},"github":{"enableEditLink":false,"editLinkText":"Edit this page on GitHub","editBranch":"main","editViewMode":"tree"},"enableSiteLastModified":true,"enableFrontmatterTags":true,"enableHashesForFMTags":false,"enableRandomlyColoredTags":true,"enableTaskNotes":true,"enablePrettyLinks":true,"siteUrl":"localhost:3000","siteFaviconPath":"favicon.ico","siteIndex":"root"}}},"__N_SSG":true}
