Beanstalk</h1>\n<p>Elastic Beanstalk is a platform within AWS that is used for deploying and scaling web applications. In simple terms this platform as a service (PaaS) takes your application code and deploys it while provisioning the supporting architecture and compute resources required for your code to run. Elastic Beanstalk also fully manages the patching and security updates for those provisioned resources.</p>\n<p>There is no charge to use Elastic Beanstalk to deploy your applications, you are only charged for the resources that are created to support your application.</p>\n<p>AWS Elastic Beanstalk allows you to quickly deploy applications and services without having to worry about configuring underlying resources, services, operating systems or web servers.</p>\n<p>Elastic Beanstalk takes care of the hosting infrastructure, coding language interpreter, operating system, security, https service and application layer. All you need to worry about is writing your code.</p>\n<p>You can develop code in a number of languages which is then zipped up and the zip file is used when instantiating a new elastic beanstalk instance.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>via <a href=\"https://www.hava.io/blog/what-is-aws-elastic-beanstalk\">What is AWS Elastic Beanstalk?</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>When we create an Elastic Beanstalk environment , underneath it, weâ€™re creating CloudFormation stack.

You can quickly deploy applications. It is great for testing. If you have a lot of dependencies and a complicated deployment process Elastic Beanstalk not be the best choice.</li>\n<li>OpsWorks is a configuration management services that provides managed instances of <a href=\"/notes/306gnfs0uii610vyobkxknb\">Chef</a> and <a href=\"/notes/zbj9fmibk0nj56jkxz7jpzg\">Puppet</a>. Great for hybrid environments because if node is reachable by Chef or Puppet instances(On-prem), it can be registered with OpsWorks.</li>\n<li>CloudFormation compared to Elastic Beanstalk deals more with AWS infrastructure rather than applications. It is geared towards system engineers, CloudFormation uses templates to create, replicate AWS infrastructure stacks rather than applications.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"how-to-use-all-three-together\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading\" href=\"#how-to-use-all-three-together\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\"><use xlink:href=\"#svg-link\"></use></svg></a>How to use all three together?</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>CloudFormation has resource definitions for both Elastic Beanstalk  and OpsWorks, which would enable implementing both of them in CloudFormation stack.</li>\n<li>Build the infrastructure with CloudFormation and manage applications with OpsWorks and Elastic Beanstalk.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"create-an-elastic-beanstalk-application\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading\" href=\"#create-an-elastic-beanstalk-application\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\"><use xlink:href=\"#svg-link\"></use></svg></a>Create an Elastic Beanstalk Application</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/zubayr/image/upload/v1655629696/wiki/kgz2k1qy0gt3433reler.png\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/zubayr/image/upload/v1655629915/wiki/qmwmq00kynqimsw13ehu.png\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/zubayr/image/upload/v1655630013/wiki/nsvk6zntgfhyb3iw4lcm.png\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"elastic-beanstalk-deployment-strategies\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading\" href=\"#elastic-beanstalk-deployment-strategies\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\"><use xlink:href=\"#svg-link\"></use></svg></a>Elastic Beanstalk deployment strategies</h2>\n<p>Weâ€™ve two environment types in Elastic Beanstalk:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Single instance \n<ul>\n<li>Has elastic IP address</li>\n<li>With a auto scaling group, you can have high availability even with a single instance.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>High availability\n<ul>\n<li>We have a group of instances</li>\n<li>Auto scaling group</li>\n<li>Load balancer</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Deployment Methods</p>\n<ul>\n<li>All at once\n<ul>\n<li>Performs updates all at once</li>\n<li>In place deployment - infrastructure doesnâ€™t change at all</li>\n<li>Fast and requires no DNS changes </li>\n<li>Will complicate rollback a little bit</li>\n<li>Increased down time if something goes wrong</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Rolling\n<ul>\n<li>Will guarantee one of the instance is up at all times</li>\n<li>When update is ongoing - theyâ€™ll be detached from the load balancer</li>\n<li>When the update is completed, theyâ€™re reattached, load balancer will perform health check(overhead)</li>\n<li>Health checks failing may lead to different instances with different versions of applications </li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Rolling/Additional batch\n<ul>\n<li>Updates are performed on newly created instances not on live instances</li>\n<li>We double auto scaling groupâ€™s capacity so we donâ€™t run into capacity issues</li>\n<li>Takes longer than regular update(overhead)</li>\n<li>Go with this when you canâ€™t afford reduced capacity(downtime)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Immutable\n<ul>\n<li>Instances are not changed(updated) theyâ€™re completely replaced</li>\n<li>New instances with the update is added to Auto Scaling Group and previous instances are killed(only if the new deployment is successful)</li>\n<li>Provides clean rollback</li>\n<li>Needs doubling of instances for a short time</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Blue/Green\n<ul>\n<li>Entire environment is cloned(Auto Scaling Group and Load Balancer)</li>\n<li>Update is deployed to the cloned environment </li>\n<li>Route53 URLs are swapped with the updated instances once deployment is successful.</li>\n<li>Prevents downtime because new resources are used</li>\n<li>Can be tested in an isolated environment </li>\n<li>Con: weâ€™re doubling our resources, requires DNS name change</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Canary\n<ul>\n<li>Allows you to roll out new code/features to a subset of users as an initial test</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/zubayr/image/upload/v1655632839/wiki/xxzvbggiv1zttmngmv42.png\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"elastic-beanstalk-environment-configuration-management\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading\" href=\"#elastic-beanstalk-environment-configuration-management\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\"><use xlink:href=\"#svg-link\"></use></svg></a>Elastic Beanstalk Environment configuration management</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>You can configure your Elastic Beanstalk Environmentâ€™s configuration using a fodler named <code>.ebextentions</code> inside which your config files go.</li>\n<li>You can add specific settings for all of the components of your environment like taking care of dependencies, Auto Scaling Group etc.</li>\n<li>We can also your configurations and load from them at a later point.</li>\n<li>Changes made from CLI or console have highest precedence, next settings loaded from a saved configurations.

Welcome to Noetic Noggin\n\nThis is [[my|archive.about]] personal wiki and a commonplace book; notes by me, for me.\n\nðŸš§ Permanently under construction ðŸš§\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/zubayr/image/upload/v1658499909/wiki/ajevkuyebljlxiblyst2.png)\n\nThis wiki was made possible with [dendron.so](https://dendron.so) and [obisidian.md](https://obsidian.md). Stored on [Github Repository](https://github.com/zubayrrr/dendron) and hosted on [Netlify](https://netlify.com) for free.\n\n## Principles\n\n### All notes should be relative to me.\n\n- All notes in principle are written for me; what I know about a subject, how I feel about a particular thing.\n- Opinions are fine as long as I feel strong epistemic confidence in the given opinion.\n- Don't over explain a note if it's not necessary, remember, these notes are for you and are relative to whatever knowledge you posses about the subject.\n- Read books and make an dedicated notes for them.\n- Listen podcasts but capture them inside a \"subject specific\" note or \"Map of Concept\" note or a note tagged #areas. Because making notes from podcasts can be tedious as they're not as well structured as books for consumption.(Whose merit is debatable.)\n- #areas are basically \"Map of Concept\" notes but I have recently come to the realization that its better to maintain them [Nikita Voloboev style](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/) but with heavy usage of transclusion and backlinking.\n  - \"Resources\" should be first processed and then mentioned inside the note, otherwise they should be left in inbox.\n\n### Gotta capture 'em all\n\n- Hog whatever information tickles your pickle([anything that gratifies one's intellectual curiosity](https://news.ycombinator.com/newsguidelines.html)).\n- [[swipes]] are interesting/useful bits of... [[quotes|swipes.quotes]], [[excerpts|swipes.excerpts]], [[sayings|swipes.sayings]], [[phrases|swipes.phrases]]. Essentially, ideas, opinions that are swiped off from [[others|resources.people]].\n- Make no distinction between \"your\" ideas and ideas of \"others\", because if you vibe with an idea; it's already yours.\n- But also remember \"If you've time to consume, you've time to produce.\".\n- Use [raindrop.io](https://raindrop.io) to manage your URL bookmarks.\n- If you need to bookmark a webpage or an article all together, use [MarkDownload](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/markdownload-markdown-web/pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi?hl=en-GB) to rip the entire page. Let's call it a [[webmark|inbox.webmark]]; it belong in the `/inbox`.\n- Similar process is employed for capturing tweets using [tweet-to-markdown](https://github.com/kbravh/tweet-to-markdown) and it also belongs in the `/inbox`.\n\n### Don't force evolution\n\n- Let your second brain evolve at it's own pace.\n- The structure should never be _too_ rigid because its meant to take form by itself.\n\n### Noise & Signal\n\n- While capturing ideas left and right is recommended, make sure you're not harming your periods of focus.\n- Have impenetrable focus periods (use Pomodoro method) where you only care about the work on hand and nothing else.\n\n### Why do any of this?\n\n- Because I can't remember everything - there's a lot of information around that interests me and there isn't enough working memory installed in me.\n- So, I make notes - to remember, to create, to meditate, to think.\n- A bodybuilder's portfolio is their body - my portfolio is my wiki.\n- Not only am I making - whatever I know - tangible by writing it down. I know exactly where to look if I ever forget something.\n- I am at the beginning of my learning adventures. When I look back at it, I will know where I came from and how my thoughts evolved over time.\n- Plus, its really fun to nerd out.\n\n## Structure of this wiki\n\n- [[slipbox.Ontology]] explains the structure of this wiki and the tags, backlinks used in it.\n- Dendron takes care of the structure and hierarchy(mostly), but I insist on using tags for backwards compatibility.\n\n## Quicklinks\n\n- [[About me|archive.about]]\n- [Github](https://github.com/zubayrrr)\n- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/zoobhalu)\n- [Blog](https://zubayrali.in)\n- [Guestbook](https://www.yourworldoftext.com/~zubayrali/)\n"},"collectionChildren":null,"customHeadContent":null,"config":{"version":5,"dev":{"enablePreviewV2":true,"enableSelfContainedVaults":true},"commands":{"lookup":{"note":{"selectionMode":"extract","confirmVaultOnCreate":true,"vaultSelectionModeOnCreate":"smart","leaveTrace":false,"bubbleUpCreateNew":true,"fuzzThreshold":0.2}},"randomNote":{},"insertNoteLink":{"aliasMode":"none","enableMultiSelect":false},"insertNoteIndex":{"enableMarker":false},"copyNoteLink":{},"templateHierarchy":"template","insertNote":{"initialValue":"templates"}},"workspace":{"vaults":[{"fsPath":".","selfContained":true,"name":"Dendron"}],"journal":{"dailyDomain":"daily","name":"journal","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd","addBehavior":"childOfDomain"},"scratch":{"name":"scratch","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd.HHmmss","addBehavior":"asOwnDomain"},"task":{"name":"task","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd","addBehavior":"asOwnDomain","statusSymbols":{"":" ","wip":"w","done":"x","assigned":"a","moved":"m","blocked":"b","delegated":"l","dropped":"d","pending":"y"},"taskCompleteStatus":["done","x"],"prioritySymbols":{"H":"high","M":"medium","L":"low"},"todoIntegration":false,"createTaskSelectionType":"selection2link"},"graph":{"zoomSpeed":1,"createStub":false},"enableAutoCreateOnDefinition":false,"enableHandlebarTemplates":true,"enableXVaultWikiLink":false,"enableRemoteVaultInit":true,"enableUserTags":true,"enableHashTags":true,"workspaceVaultSyncMode":"noCommit","enableAutoFoldFrontmatter":false,"enableEditorDecorations":true,"maxPreviewsCached":10,"maxNoteLength":204800,"enableFullHierarchyNoteTitle":false,"enableSmartRefs":true},"preview":{"enableFMTitle":true,"enableNoteTitleForLink":true,"enableFrontmatterTags":true,"enableHashesForFMTags":false,"enableMermaid":true,"enablePrettyRefs":true,"enableKatex":true,"automaticallyShowPreview":false},"publishing":{"theme":"dark","enableFMTitle":true,"enableNoteTitleForLink":true,"enableMermaid":true,"enablePrettyRefs":true,"enableKatex":true,"copyAssets":true,"siteHierarchies":["root"],"writeStubs":false,"siteRootDir":"docs","seo":{"title":"Noetic Noggin","description":"Personal Wiki / Digital Garden","author":"Zubayr Ali","twitter":"zoobhalu"},"github":{"enableEditLink":false,"editLinkText":"Edit this page on GitHub","editBranch":"main","editViewMode":"tree"},"enableSiteLastModified":true,"enableFrontmatterTags":true,"enableHashesForFMTags":false,"enableRandomlyColoredTags":true,"enableTaskNotes":true,"enablePrettyLinks":true,"siteUrl":"localhost:3000","siteFaviconPath":"favicon.ico","siteIndex":"root"}}},"__N_SSG":true}
