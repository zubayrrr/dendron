I believe I've achieved comparable results on my <a href=\"https://elementary.io/\">elementary OS</a> install, and I want to share the tools I'm relying on on a daily basis.</p>\n<h2 id=\"a-better-launcher\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading\" href=\"#a-better-launcher\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\"><use xlink:href=\"#svg-link\"></use></svg></a>A better launcher</h2>\n<p>I have a lot of respect for Slingshot, a default launcher for <strong>elementary OS</strong>. It has some features that I really miss when I'm not behind my favourite desktop environment, most notable of which are:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Fuzzy search:</strong> Instead of having to type \"firefox\" precisely, I can (mis)type something that resembles the word Firefox and it will still show it as a result. For example: \"ffx\", \"frf\", \"ffox\". Any combination of letters contained in the word \"Firefox\" will return it as a result.</li>\n<li><strong>Quick calculations:</strong> When I want to quickly calculate something basic, I don't have to start a dedicated calculator app. I just press the ~start~ meta key and do them straight from my app launcher.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><a href=\"https://ulauncher.io/\">Ulauncher</a> takes it a step further, similarly to how Alfred does it on a macOS. Sure, I can launch applications using it, but I can also install plugins for it that allow me to quickly reach many, <em>many</em> functions. Some examples include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://ext.ulauncher.io/-/github-ulauncher-ulauncher-timer\">Starting a timer</a> with something like <code>ti 10m Message goes here</code>, which will show me a desktop notification with a defined message after the specified amount of time.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://ext.ulauncher.io/-/github-pywkm-ulauncher-spotify\">Control Spotify</a> . Typing <code>sp</code> gives me the ability to pause/play current track, as well as to skip to the next or previous track.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://ext.ulauncher.io/-/github-jetbug123-ulauncher-ssh\">SSH connection manager</a> allows me to quickly reach SSH connections saved in my <code>~/.ssh/config</code>.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://ext.ulauncher.io/-/github-friday-ulauncher-clipboard\">Clipboard manager</a> saves anything that's in my clipboard, allowing me to quickly access things I've copied over.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Depending on your needs, it can do a lot more, like <a href=\"https://ext.ulauncher.io/-/github-brpaz-ulauncher-vscode-projects\">launch VSCode projects</a> , <a href=\"https://ext.ulauncher.io/-/github-brpaz-ulauncher-docker\">manage Docker containers</a> , <a href=\"https://ext.ulauncher.io/-/github-friday-ulauncher-hash2\">calculate hashes</a> , <a href=\"https://ext.ulauncher.io/-/github-safaariman-ulauncher-jira\">search through Jira</a> , <a href=\"https://ext.ulauncher.io/-/github-munim-ulauncher-ip-lookup\">do an IP lookup</a> , <a href=\"https://ext.ulauncher.io/-/github-noam09-ulauncher-units\">convert units</a> , look for a password in <a href=\"https://ext.ulauncher.io/-/github-kbialek-ulauncher-bitwarden\">Bitwarden</a> or <a href=\"https://ext.ulauncher.io/-/github-brpaz-ulauncher-lastpass\">LastPass</a> and on and on and on.</p>\n<p>I use a combination of the two. I use the default launcher for launching apps and doing some calculations, and I use Ulauncher to do so much more.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, none of these solutions have something similar to <a href=\"https://www.alfredapp.com/workflows/\">Alfred's Workflows</a> , but you can create your own Ulauncher extensiosn or launch scripts written in your preferred scripting language.</p>\n<h2 id=\"glorified-to-do-list-manager\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading\" href=\"#glorified-to-do-list-manager\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\"><use xlink:href=\"#svg-link\"></use></svg></a>Glorified to-do list manager</h2>\n<p>I don't think <em>any</em> to-do app available on Linux comes even close to being as beautiful and feature-packed as Planner. Just look at how pretty it is!</p>\n<p><img src=\"inbox/assets/Planner&#x27;s%20main%20interface.png\" alt=\"Planner&#x27;s main interface\"></p>\n<p>Your projects can be organised into folders, and your tasks can have labels, deadlines, reminders, and so on. Tasks can be organized into projects, sections, and have sub-tasks. You can sync them with Todoist to have them available on more devices, but you don't have to.</p>\n<p>Similarly to Todoist, you can see all the tasks that have a deadline set to today + any overdue tasks, you can see the tasks that are due soon, and you have an inbox as a place where you can store the tasks quickly without having to figure out which project they should go to.</p>\n<p>One killer feature for me is that I can have a keyboard shortcut that toggles the quick add window, allowing me to add a new task pretty effortlessly regardless of which app I'm using.</p>\n<h2 id=\"expanding-text\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading\" href=\"#expanding-text\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\"><use xlink:href=\"#svg-link\"></use></svg></a>Expanding text</h2>\n<p>For text expansion, I use a cross-platform tool written in Rust called <a href=\"https://espanso.org/\">Espanso</a> . Regardless of what I'm typing, I can define shortcuts that convert something easy to write in something that takes more effort. For example, I can type <code>:date</code> in any text field and it will be swapped by today's date when I press the space bar.</p>\n<p>I can define custom text replacements by simply adding two lines inside a YAML file (<code>~/.config/espanso/default.yml</code>):</p>\n<pre><code>matches:\n  - trigger: \":hw\"\n    replace: \"Hello world\"\n</code></pre>\n<p>It can also use a trigger to return an output from a script or a shell command, though I have yet to find a use case for that. You can also configure a shortcut to trigger a <a href=\"https://espanso.org/docs/passive-mode/\">passive mode</a> , which will select everything in the current text field and expand it if it finds any triggers you've defined.</p>\n<p>On the downside, it currently doesn't come with a graphical interface, though a graphical interface is at the top of its <a href=\"https://github.com/federico-terzi/espanso/issues/255\">roadmap</a> .</p>\n<h2 id=\"a-note-taking-system\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading\" href=\"#a-note-taking-system\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\"><use xlink:href=\"#svg-link\"></use></svg></a>A note-taking system</h2>\n<p>I've tried many solutions for note taking over the years, like keeping my notes in Markdown files, <a href=\"https://www.notion.so/\">Notion</a> , and <a href=\"https://www.inkdrop.app/\">Inkdrop</a> . That all ended when I found out about <a href=\"https://obsidian.md/\">Obsidian</a> . It's my go-to note taking system ever since it launched in public beta and I can't see myself using anything else for the foreseeable future.</p>\n<p>A few months ago I wrote about <a href=\"https://input.sh/why-i-dont-write-my-notes-in-markdown/\">why I do(n't) keep my notes in Markdown</a>. In it, I emphasized a certain set of problems I've experienced whenever I wanted to keep my notes inside of a folder full of Markdown files:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Linking between notes is hard.</li>\n<li>Dealing with images is hard.</li>\n<li>Editing notes on a phone.</li>\n<li>Clipping articles into my notes.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The first two are instantly solved by Obsidian out-of-the-box. <a href=\"https://gitjournal.io/\">GitJournal</a> solved my third one, and I've solved the last one by <a href=\"https://gitjournal.io/\">adjusting the script</a> I've outlined in the previous article.</p>\n<p>Now I can truly keep all of my notes in one place and sync them between devices however I want to. I can also generate a handy graph showing various links I've created between my notes:</p>\n<p><img src=\"inbox/assets/Screenshot-from-2020-08-03-14-44-40.png\" alt=\"Screenshot-from-2020-08-03-14-44-40\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"in-conclusion\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading\" href=\"#in-conclusion\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\"><use xlink:href=\"#svg-link\"></use></svg></a>In conclusion</h2>\n<p>I was able to transform my Linux experience to another level using a combination of awesome productivity tools that work natively on my Linux-based system. Overall, I'm pretty happy with my setup, as I was able to find an alternative to the majority of macOS-specific productivity tools I always wished to have access to.</p>\n<p>If you know of a similarly useful Linux-based productivity tool or are building one, please let me know on Mastodon / Twitter, as I'd love to be one of your first users. I'm not an open source purist and I'm more than willing to pay money for something that will truly improve my daily workflow.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"tags\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\"

Welcome to Noetic Noggin\n\nThis is [[my|archive.about]] personal wiki and a commonplace book; notes by me, for me.\n\n🚧 Permanently under construction 🚧\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/zubayr/image/upload/v1658499909/wiki/ajevkuyebljlxiblyst2.png)\n\nThis wiki was made possible with [dendron.so](https://dendron.so) and [obisidian.md](https://obsidian.md). Stored on [Github Repository](https://github.com/zubayrrr/dendron) and hosted on [Netlify](https://netlify.com) for free.\n\n## Principles\n\n### All notes should be relative to me.\n\n- All notes in principle are written for me; what I know about a subject, how I feel about a particular thing.\n- Opinions are fine as long as I feel strong epistemic confidence in the given opinion.\n- Don't over explain a note if it's not necessary, remember, these notes are for you and are relative to whatever knowledge you posses about the subject.\n- Read books and make an dedicated notes for them.\n- Listen podcasts but capture them inside a \"subject specific\" note or \"Map of Concept\" note or a note tagged #areas. Because making notes from podcasts can be tedious as they're not as well structured as books for consumption.(Whose merit is debatable.)\n- #areas are basically \"Map of Concept\" notes but I have recently come to the realization that its better to maintain them [Nikita Voloboev style](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/) but with heavy usage of transclusion and backlinking.\n  - \"Resources\" should be first processed and then mentioned inside the note, otherwise they should be left in inbox.\n\n### Gotta capture 'em all\n\n- Hog whatever information tickles your pickle([anything that gratifies one's intellectual curiosity](https://news.ycombinator.com/newsguidelines.html)).\n- [[swipes]] are interesting/useful bits of... [[quotes|swipes.quotes]], [[excerpts|swipes.excerpts]], [[sayings|swipes.sayings]], [[phrases|swipes.phrases]]. Essentially, ideas, opinions that are swiped off from [[others|resources.people]].\n- Make no distinction between \"your\" ideas and ideas of \"others\", because if you vibe with an idea; it's already yours.\n- But also remember \"If you've time to consume, you've time to produce.\".\n- Use [raindrop.io](https://raindrop.io) to manage your URL bookmarks.\n- If you need to bookmark a webpage or an article all together, use [MarkDownload](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/markdownload-markdown-web/pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi?hl=en-GB) to rip the entire page. Let's call it a [[webmark|inbox.webmark]]; it belong in the `/inbox`.\n- Similar process is employed for capturing tweets using [tweet-to-markdown](https://github.com/kbravh/tweet-to-markdown) and it also belongs in the `/inbox`.\n\n### Don't force evolution\n\n- Let your second brain evolve at it's own pace.\n- The structure should never be _too_ rigid because its meant to take form by itself.\n\n### Noise & Signal\n\n- While capturing ideas left and right is recommended, make sure you're not harming your periods of focus.\n- Have impenetrable focus periods (use Pomodoro method) where you only care about the work on hand and nothing else.\n\n### Why do any of this?\n\n- Because I can't remember everything - there's a lot of information around that interests me and there isn't enough working memory installed in me.\n- So, I make notes - to remember, to create, to meditate, to think.\n- A bodybuilder's portfolio is their body - my portfolio is my wiki.\n- Not only am I making - whatever I know - tangible by writing it down. I know exactly where to look if I ever forget something.\n- I am at the beginning of my learning adventures. When I look back at it, I will know where I came from and how my thoughts evolved over time.\n- Plus, its really fun to nerd out.\n\n## Structure of this wiki\n\n- [[slipbox.Ontology]] explains the structure of this wiki and the tags, backlinks used in it.\n- Dendron takes care of the structure and hierarchy(mostly), but I insist on using tags for backwards compatibility.\n\n## Quicklinks\n\n- [[About me|archive.about]]\n- [Github](https://github.com/zubayrrr)\n- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/zoobhalu)\n- [Blog](https://zubayrali.in)\n- [Guestbook](https://www.yourworldoftext.com/~zubayrali/)\n"},"collectionChildren":null,"customHeadContent":null,"config":{"version":5,"dev":{"enablePreviewV2":true,"enableSelfContainedVaults":true},"commands":{"lookup":{"note":{"selectionMode":"extract","confirmVaultOnCreate":true,"vaultSelectionModeOnCreate":"smart","leaveTrace":false,"bubbleUpCreateNew":true,"fuzzThreshold":0.2}},"randomNote":{},"insertNoteLink":{"aliasMode":"none","enableMultiSelect":false},"insertNoteIndex":{"enableMarker":false},"copyNoteLink":{},"templateHierarchy":"template","insertNote":{"initialValue":"templates"}},"workspace":{"vaults":[{"fsPath":".","selfContained":true,"name":"Dendron"}],"journal":{"dailyDomain":"daily","name":"journal","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd","addBehavior":"childOfDomain"},"scratch":{"name":"scratch","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd.HHmmss","addBehavior":"asOwnDomain"},"task":{"name":"task","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd","addBehavior":"asOwnDomain","statusSymbols":{"":" ","wip":"w","done":"x","assigned":"a","moved":"m","blocked":"b","delegated":"l","dropped":"d","pending":"y"},"taskCompleteStatus":["done","x"],"prioritySymbols":{"H":"high","M":"medium","L":"low"},"todoIntegration":false,"createTaskSelectionType":"selection2link"},"graph":{"zoomSpeed":1,"createStub":false},"enableAutoCreateOnDefinition":false,"enableHandlebarTemplates":true,"enableXVaultWikiLink":false,"enableRemoteVaultInit":true,"enableUserTags":true,"enableHashTags":true,"workspaceVaultSyncMode":"noCommit","enableAutoFoldFrontmatter":false,"enableEditorDecorations":true,"maxPreviewsCached":10,"maxNoteLength":204800,"enableFullHierarchyNoteTitle":false,"enableSmartRefs":true},"preview":{"enableFMTitle":true,"enableNoteTitleForLink":true,"enableFrontmatterTags":true,"enableHashesForFMTags":false,"enableMermaid":true,"enablePrettyRefs":true,"enableKatex":true,"automaticallyShowPreview":false},"publishing":{"theme":"dark","enableFMTitle":true,"enableNoteTitleForLink":true,"enableMermaid":true,"enablePrettyRefs":true,"enableKatex":true,"copyAssets":true,"siteHierarchies":["root"],"writeStubs":false,"siteRootDir":"docs","seo":{"title":"Noetic Noggin","description":"Personal Wiki / Digital Garden","author":"Zubayr Ali","twitter":"zoobhalu"},"github":{"enableEditLink":false,"editLinkText":"Edit this page on GitHub","editBranch":"main","editViewMode":"tree"},"enableSiteLastModified":true,"enableFrontmatterTags":true,"enableHashesForFMTags":false,"enableRandomlyColoredTags":true,"enableTaskNotes":true,"enablePrettyLinks":true,"siteUrl":"localhost:3000","siteFaviconPath":"favicon.ico","siteIndex":"root"}}},"__N_SSG":true}
