Address</h1>\n<p>Related: <a href=\"/notes/9vmmmhyayk6vi0i7w5cnwjv\">Subnet</a></p>\n<hr>\n<p>IP Address is basically how computers(servers) talk to each other on the internet. IP Address is provided by a Network Interface of a computer, these are public IP Addresses. IP Address are made user friendly by using a <a href=\"/notes/pjbeze05otspq0j7j48beqp\">DNS</a>that converts a domain name to an IP Address.</p>\n<p><strong>IP Address Components:</strong></p>\n<p>Like other network layer protocols, the IP addressing scheme is integral to the process of routing IP data through an internetwork.</p>\n<p>Each host on a TCP/IP network is assigned a unique 32-bit logical address. The IP address is divided into two main parts; the Network Number and the Host Number.</p>\n<p>The network number identifies the network and must be assigned by the Internet Network Information Center (InterNIC) if the network is to be part of the Internet.</p>\n<p>The host number identifies a host in the network and is assigned by the local network administrator.</p>\n<p><strong>IP Address Format:</strong></p>\n<p>The 32-bit IP address is grouped 8 bits at a time, each group of 8 bits is an octet. Each of the four octets are separated by a dot, and represented in decimal format, this is known as dotted decimal notation. Each bit in an octet has a binary weight (128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1). The minimum value for an octet is 0 (all bits set to 0), and the maximum value for an octet is 255 (all bits set to 1).</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/zubayr/image/upload/v1655735910/wiki/wtzdd2lbx2pixujmqqx0.png\"></p>\n<p><strong>IP Address Classes:</strong></p>\n<p>IP addressing supports three different commercial address classes; Class A, Class B, and Class C.</p>\n<p>In a class A address, the first octet is the network portion, so the class A address of, 10.1.25.1, has a major network address of 10. Octets 2, 3, and 4 (the next 24 bits) are for the hosts. Class A addresses are used for networks that have more than 65,536 hosts (actually, up to 16,581,375 hosts!).</p>\n<p>In a class B address, the first two octets are the network portion, so the class B address of, 172.16.122.204, has a major network address of 172.16. Octets 3 and 4 (the next 16 bits) are for the hosts. Class B addresses are used for networks that have between 256 and 65,536 hosts.</p>\n<p>In a class C address, the first three octets are the network portion. The class C address of, 193.18.9.45, has a major network address of 193.18.9. Octet 4 (the last 8 bits) is for hosts. Class C addresses are used for networks with less than 254 hosts.</p>\n<p>Via ‚Äî <a href=\"http://penta2.ufrgs.br/trouble/ts_ip.htm\">Basic IP Addressing and Troubleshooting Guide</a></p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"structure-of-an-ip-address\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading\" href=\"#structure-of-an-ip-address\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\"><use xlink:href=\"#svg-link\"></use></svg></a>Structure of an IP Address</h2>\n<p>IP Addresses are written in decimal dotted notation.</p>\n<p><code>192.168.0.1</code></p>\n<p>Each part of the IP address is a binary octet.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/zubayr/image/upload/v1656322930/wiki/gruxal4tsobjfhxdkw00.png\"></p>\n<p>This is important for <a href=\"/notes/9vmmmhyayk6vi0i7w5cnwjv\">Subnet</a>ting.</p>\n<h2 id=\"networks-and-hosts\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading\" href=\"#networks-and-hosts\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\"><use xlink:href=\"#svg-link\"></use></svg></a>Networks and Hosts</h2>\n<p>Every IP address has a Network ID and a Host ID</p>\n<p>Network ID will remain same for every computer on this network.</p>\n<p>Host ID will be unique for every computer on this network.</p>\n<p>Subnet masks tells us which part is the Network ID and which is Host ID.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/zubayr/image/upload/v1656323194/wiki/glrh3blvpzga1d4itquu.png\"></p>\n<p>When we have <code>255</code> (all the 8 bits are 1) is where we essentially have a bit that is a <code>1</code>.

IP addresses contain 4 octets, each consisting of 8 bits giving values between 0 and 255. The decimal value that comes after the slash is the number of bits consisting of the routing prefix. This in turn can be translated into a netmask, and also designates how many available addresses are in the block.</p>\n<p>Sometimes we want to vary the length of our subnet masks and we don‚Äôt want to stick to the standard classes so we use CIDR. It helps optimize the IP space. It uses variable length subnet mask(VLSM).</p>\n<p>CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) -- also known as supernetting -- is a method of assigning Internet Protocol (IP) addresses that improves the efficiency of address distribution and replaces the previous system based on Class A, Class B and Class C networks.</p>\n<h2 id=\"resources\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading\" href=\"#resources\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\"><use xlink:href=\"#svg-link\"></use></svg></a>Resources</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://cidr.xyz/\">CIDR.xyz</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z07HTSzzp3o&#x26;t=216s\">IPv4, CIDR, and VPC Subnets Made Simple! - YouTube</a></li>\n</ul>\n</div></div><p></p><p></p>\n<hr>\n<h2 id=\"how-is-an-ip-address-assigned\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading\" href=\"#how-is-an-ip-address-assigned\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\"><use xlink:href=\"#svg-link\"></use></svg></a>How is an <a href=\"/notes/mj7tlpbhhzfpg8pbegkkasb\">IP Address</a> assigned?</h2>\n<p>Apparently using some <a href=\"/notes/rtyj4xcc6s8nx0yi5mxhmjy\">DHCP</a> magic, <a href=\"/notes/7r0uunvdkt9sgw6ajq5vg0x\">router</a> assigns an <a href=\"/notes/mj7tlpbhhzfpg8pbegkkasb\">IP Address</a> to any computer/thing that connects to it.</p>\n<p>Why is that most of the IP address start from <code>192.168.1.204</code> when they each of the octet can be anywhere between 0.255?</p>\n<p>It is because of subnet mask.

Welcome to Noetic Noggin\n\nThis is [[my|archive.about]] personal wiki and a commonplace book; notes by me, for me.\n\nüöß Permanently under construction üöß\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/zubayr/image/upload/v1658499909/wiki/ajevkuyebljlxiblyst2.png)\n\nThis wiki was made possible with [dendron.so](https://dendron.so) and [obisidian.md](https://obsidian.md). Stored on [Github Repository](https://github.com/zubayrrr/dendron) and hosted on [Netlify](https://netlify.com) for free.\n\n## Principles\n\n### All notes should be relative to me.\n\n- All notes in principle are written for me; what I know about a subject, how I feel about a particular thing.\n- Opinions are fine as long as I feel strong epistemic confidence in the given opinion.\n- Don't over explain a note if it's not necessary, remember, these notes are for you and are relative to whatever knowledge you posses about the subject.\n- Read books and make an dedicated notes for them.\n- Listen podcasts but capture them inside a \"subject specific\" note or \"Map of Concept\" note or a note tagged #areas. Because making notes from podcasts can be tedious as they're not as well structured as books for consumption.(Whose merit is debatable.)\n- #areas are basically \"Map of Concept\" notes but I have recently come to the realization that its better to maintain them [Nikita Voloboev style](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/) but with heavy usage of transclusion and backlinking.\n  - \"Resources\" should be first processed and then mentioned inside the note, otherwise they should be left in inbox.\n\n### Gotta capture 'em all\n\n- Hog whatever information tickles your pickle([anything that gratifies one's intellectual curiosity](https://news.ycombinator.com/newsguidelines.html)).\n- [[swipes]] are interesting/useful bits of... [[quotes|swipes.quotes]], [[excerpts|swipes.excerpts]], [[sayings|swipes.sayings]], [[phrases|swipes.phrases]]. Essentially, ideas, opinions that are swiped off from [[others|resources.people]].\n- Make no distinction between \"your\" ideas and ideas of \"others\", because if you vibe with an idea; it's already yours.\n- But also remember \"If you've time to consume, you've time to produce.\".\n- Use [raindrop.io](https://raindrop.io) to manage your URL bookmarks.\n- If you need to bookmark a webpage or an article all together, use [MarkDownload](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/markdownload-markdown-web/pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi?hl=en-GB) to rip the entire page. Let's call it a [[webmark|inbox.webmark]]; it belong in the `/inbox`.\n- Similar process is employed for capturing tweets using [tweet-to-markdown](https://github.com/kbravh/tweet-to-markdown) and it also belongs in the `/inbox`.\n\n### Don't force evolution\n\n- Let your second brain evolve at it's own pace.\n- The structure should never be _too_ rigid because its meant to take form by itself.\n\n### Noise & Signal\n\n- While capturing ideas left and right is recommended, make sure you're not harming your periods of focus.\n- Have impenetrable focus periods (use Pomodoro method) where you only care about the work on hand and nothing else.\n\n### Why do any of this?\n\n- Because I can't remember everything - there's a lot of information around that interests me and there isn't enough working memory installed in me.\n- So, I make notes - to remember, to create, to meditate, to think.\n- A bodybuilder's portfolio is their body - my portfolio is my wiki.\n- Not only am I making - whatever I know - tangible by writing it down. I know exactly where to look if I ever forget something.\n- I am at the beginning of my learning adventures. When I look back at it, I will know where I came from and how my thoughts evolved over time.\n- Plus, its really fun to nerd out.\n\n## Structure of this wiki\n\n- [[slipbox.Ontology]] explains the structure of this wiki and the tags, backlinks used in it.\n- Dendron takes care of the structure and hierarchy(mostly), but I insist on using tags for backwards compatibility.\n\n## Quicklinks\n\n- [[About me|archive.about]]\n- [Github](https://github.com/zubayrrr)\n- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/zoobhalu)\n- [Blog](https://zubayrali.in)\n- [Guestbook](https://www.yourworldoftext.com/~zubayrali/)\n"},"collectionChildren":null,"customHeadContent":null,"config":{"version":5,"dev":{"enablePreviewV2":true,"enableSelfContainedVaults":true},"commands":{"lookup":{"note":{"selectionMode":"extract","confirmVaultOnCreate":true,"vaultSelectionModeOnCreate":"smart","leaveTrace":false,"bubbleUpCreateNew":true,"fuzzThreshold":0.2}},"randomNote":{},"insertNoteLink":{"aliasMode":"none","enableMultiSelect":false},"insertNoteIndex":{"enableMarker":false},"copyNoteLink":{},"templateHierarchy":"template","insertNote":{"initialValue":"templates"}},"workspace":{"vaults":[{"fsPath":".","selfContained":true,"name":"Dendron"}],"journal":{"dailyDomain":"daily","name":"journal","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd","addBehavior":"childOfDomain"},"scratch":{"name":"scratch","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd.HHmmss","addBehavior":"asOwnDomain"},"task":{"name":"task","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd","addBehavior":"asOwnDomain","statusSymbols":{"":" ","wip":"w","done":"x","assigned":"a","moved":"m","blocked":"b","delegated":"l","dropped":"d","pending":"y"},"taskCompleteStatus":["done","x"],"prioritySymbols":{"H":"high","M":"medium","L":"low"},"todoIntegration":false,"createTaskSelectionType":"selection2link"},"graph":{"zoomSpeed":1,"createStub":false},"enableAutoCreateOnDefinition":false,"enableHandlebarTemplates":true,"enableXVaultWikiLink":false,"enableRemoteVaultInit":true,"enableUserTags":true,"enableHashTags":true,"workspaceVaultSyncMode":"noCommit","enableAutoFoldFrontmatter":false,"enableEditorDecorations":true,"maxPreviewsCached":10,"maxNoteLength":204800,"enableFullHierarchyNoteTitle":false,"enableSmartRefs":true},"preview":{"enableFMTitle":true,"enableNoteTitleForLink":true,"enableFrontmatterTags":true,"enableHashesForFMTags":false,"enableMermaid":true,"enablePrettyRefs":true,"enableKatex":true,"automaticallyShowPreview":false},"publishing":{"theme":"dark","enableFMTitle":true,"enableNoteTitleForLink":true,"enableMermaid":true,"enablePrettyRefs":true,"enableKatex":true,"copyAssets":true,"siteHierarchies":["root"],"writeStubs":false,"siteRootDir":"docs","seo":{"title":"Noetic Noggin","description":"Personal Wiki / Digital Garden","author":"Zubayr Ali","twitter":"zoobhalu"},"github":{"enableEditLink":false,"editLinkText":"Edit this page on GitHub","editBranch":"main","editViewMode":"tree"},"enableSiteLastModified":true,"enableFrontmatterTags":true,"enableHashesForFMTags":false,"enableRandomlyColoredTags":true,"enableTaskNotes":true,"enablePrettyLinks":true,"siteUrl":"localhost:3000","siteFaviconPath":"favicon.ico","siteIndex":"root"}}},"__N_SSG":true}
