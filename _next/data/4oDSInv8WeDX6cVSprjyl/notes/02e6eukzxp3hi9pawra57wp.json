You boil things down to the most fundamental truths and say, ‘What are we sure is true?’ … and then reason up from there.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This method runs in contrast to our natural wiring.</p>\n<p>When we encounter challenging problems, our tendency is to rely on base level assumptions we have been told are true (or we believe to be true). Why? It’s quick and easy to do.</p>\n<p>This is called \"reasoning by analogy”—it leads to solutions that are much like something else. Slight modifications or iterations on an existing solution. The unimaginative, linear solutions that closely resemble what has been done before.</p>\n<p>To be sure, it can be very useful when speed is the priority. Moving fast has its advantages at times—like if our ancestors were trying to avoid being eaten by a lion! But reasoning by analogy falls short when dealing with complex problems requiring creative, imaginative solutions.</p>\n<p>Imagine the solution to a problem as a house:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The foundation of the house is the assumptions upon which the ultimate solution will rest.</li>\n<li>If it's a shoddy, quickly-built foundation, the house may collapse. Even if it remains standing, the architect and builder will know that they are limited in what they can build on top of it.</li>\n<li>If it's a sturdy, deliberately-built foundation, the house will thrive. The architect and builder can get creative with what they build on top of it, as they know the base is strong.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>First principles form that sturdy, deliberately-built foundation for the house.</p>\n<h3 id=\"elon-musk--spacex\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading\" href=\"#elon-musk--spacex\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\"><use xlink:href=\"#svg-link\"></use></svg></a>Elon Musk &#x26; SpaceX</h3>\n<p>To bring this to life, let's look at a classic example of first principles thinking in action: Elon Musk &#x26; SpaceX.</p>\n<p>First off, what was the problem?</p>\n<p>Sending a rocket to Mars to begin the process of making humans an interplanetary species.

It was not only financially untenable—SpaceX was a startup at the time—it was also grounded in assumptions of how rockets have always been built and what they should cost.</p>\n<p>Taking stock on the situation:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Complex Problem ✅</li>\n<li>Creativity > Speed ✅</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So he turned to first principles thinking:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Physics teaches you to reason from first principles rather than by analogy. So I said, okay, let’s look at the first principles. What is a rocket made of? Aerospace-grade aluminum alloys, plus some titanium, copper, and carbon fiber. Then I asked, what is the value of those materials on the commodity market? It turned out that the materials cost of a rocket was around two percent of the typical price.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Based on this upfront analysis, SpaceX began building its own rockets and software systems that would dramatically alter the future of the space economy.</p>\n<p>Rather than accepting the established \"truths\" about the cost of a rocket, Musk grounded his problem solving in first principles.</p>\n<p>Today, SpaceX rockets are doing extraordinary things at a fraction of the historical cost. Furthermore, Elon Musk and SpaceX shattered the deeply-engrained beliefs about the costs of doing business in space, which has unlocked hundreds of other entrepreneurs and companies to build new, innovative solutions for the future.</p>\n<p>The dreams of a Mars voyage in our lifetimes are alive and well…</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fba5cb3df-55f9-4399-bde4-24fd2db6c058_3372x2248.jpeg\"><img src=\"/assets/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fba5cb3df-55f9-4399-bde4-24fd2db6c058_3372x2248.jpeg\"></a></p>\n<h3 id=\"how-to-use-first-principles-thinking\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading\" href=\"#how-to-use-first-principles-thinking\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\"><use xlink:href=\"#svg-link\"></use></svg></a>How to Use First Principles Thinking</h3>\n<p>Ok, now that we have covered the theory, let’s get into the practice.

Shane Parrish calls this \"<a href=\"https://fs.blog/first-principles/\">Socratic Questioning</a>”—think of it as a methodical process of resurfacing the insatiably curious child inside you.</p>\n<p>Here are a few key questions to get you started:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>What is the problem I am trying to solve? We often waste time and energy trying to solve the \"wrong\" problem. Identify the \"right\" problem.</li>\n<li>What do I know to be true about this problem? Write down everything you know about the problem (and its previously attempted solutions).</li>\n<li>Why do I believe these \"truths\" to be true? How do I know they are true? Identify the source of your beliefs on the problem. Be ruthless in evaluating their integrity and validity.</li>\n<li>How can I support these beliefs? Is there real evidence to support them? Seek out hard, tangible evidence that proves these beliefs to be true. If you cannot find it, or if the sources are of questionable integrity, you have learned something valuable about your beliefs.</li>\n<li>Are my emotions clouding my judgment and reasoning? When emotions drive our thoughts and decisions, we rarely see good outcomes. Remove emotions from the process.</li>\n<li>What alternative beliefs or viewpoints might exist? Acknowledging and understanding alternative viewpoints is a superpower. Seek them out. Embrace them. Evaluate them on their merits and ask these same fundamental questions about them.</li>\n<li>What are the consequences of being wrong in my original beliefs? Understanding the stakes is critical. Always understand the stakes.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>First principles thinking starts with questioning your beliefs. Asking these questions will help you drill down to the foundational truths of a problem. Once you uncover them, you can begin to slowly build up to a more creative, imaginative solution.</p>\n<h3 id=\"conclusion\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading\" href=\"#conclusion\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\"><use xlink:href=\"#svg-link\"></use></svg></a>Conclusion</h3>\n<p>The world is filled with unimaginative, copycat solutions. These solutions—slight improvements—predictably lead to linear outcomes.</p>\n<p>Leveraging first principles thinking is intense and time consuming—but it is also a clear, tried-and-true path to devising creative solutions to complex problems that drive non-linear, asymmetric outcomes.</p>\n<p>Tim Urban captured it well in a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/waitbutwhy/status/1374466415864860680?s=20\">recent tweet</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Feed a man a fish, feed him for a night.</p>\n<p>Teach a man to fish, feed him for a lifetime.</p>\n<p>Teach a man to reason from first principles, he can teach himself to fish. Then he can invent a better fishing rod and feed a billion people.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>First principles thinkers are independent thinkers. We can all strive to leverage this framework more effectively in our lives.</p>\n<p>The world will be the ultimate beneficiary…</p>\n<h2 id=\"where-it-happens-podcast\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading\" href=\"#where-it-happens-podcast\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\"><use xlink:href=\"#svg-link\"></use></svg></a>Where It Happens Podcast</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F30c8b5f2-db51-40d7-881a-82ac0e55cfe5_1100x619.png\"><img src=\"/assets/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F30c8b5f2-db51-40d7-881a-82ac0e55cfe5_1100x619.png\"></a></p>\n<p><strong>Memes Rule the World with Dogecoin</strong> <strong>Creator Billy Markus</strong></p>\n<p>Watch it on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hljGTDLGdXg\">YouTube</a> and listen to it on <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/where-it-happens/id1593424985?i=1000548336933\">Apple Podcasts</a> or <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/episode/5biMT0ZU1Nb2ljgmDZnLN8?si=948f85cba8bc4e02\">Spotify</a>.

[obisidian.md](https://obsidian.md). Stored on [Github Repository](https://github.com/zubayrrr/dendron) and hosted on [Netlify](https://netlify.com) for free.\n\n## Principles\n\n### All notes should be relative to me.\n\n- All notes in principle are written for me; what I know about a subject, how I feel about a particular thing.\n- Opinions are fine as long as I feel strong epistemic confidence in the given opinion.\n- Don't over explain a note if it's not necessary, remember, these notes are for you and are relative to whatever knowledge you posses about the subject.\n- Read books and make an dedicated notes for them.\n- Listen podcasts but capture them inside a \"subject specific\" note or \"Map of Concept\" note or a note tagged #areas. Because making notes from podcasts can be tedious as they're not as well structured as books for consumption.(Whose merit is debatable.)\n- #areas are basically \"Map of Concept\" notes but I have recently come to the realization that its better to maintain them [Nikita Voloboev style](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/) but with heavy usage of transclusion and backlinking.\n  - \"Resources\" should be first processed and then mentioned inside the note, otherwise they should be left in inbox.\n\n### Gotta capture 'em all\n\n- Hog whatever information tickles your pickle([anything that gratifies one's intellectual curiosity](https://news.ycombinator.com/newsguidelines.html)).\n- [[swipes]] are interesting/useful bits of... [[quotes|swipes.quotes]], [[excerpts|swipes.excerpts]], [[sayings|swipes.sayings]], [[phrases|swipes.phrases]]. Essentially, ideas, opinions that are swiped off from [[others|resources.people]].\n- Make no distinction between \"your\" ideas and ideas of \"others\", because if you vibe with an idea; it's already yours.\n- But also remember \"If you've time to consume, you've time to produce.\".\n- Use [raindrop.io](https://raindrop.io) to manage your URL bookmarks.\n- If you need to bookmark a webpage or an article all together, use [MarkDownload](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/markdownload-markdown-web/pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi?hl=en-GB) to rip the entire page. Let's call it a [[webmark|inbox.webmark]]; it belong in the `/inbox`.\n- Similar process is employed for capturing tweets using [tweet-to-markdown](https://github.com/kbravh/tweet-to-markdown) and it also belongs in the `/inbox`.\n\n### Don't force evolution\n\n- Let your second brain evolve at it's own pace.\n- The structure should never be _too_ rigid because its meant to take form by itself.\n\n### Noise & Signal\n\n- While capturing ideas left and right is recommended, make sure you're not harming your periods of focus.\n- Have impenetrable focus periods (use Pomodoro method) where you only care about the work on hand and nothing else.\n\n### Why do any of this?\n\n- Because I can't remember everything - there's a lot of information around that interests me and there isn't enough working memory installed in me.\n- So, I make notes - to remember, to create, to meditate, to think.\n- A bodybuilder's portfolio is their body - my portfolio is my wiki.\n- Not only am I making - whatever I know - tangible by writing it down. I know exactly where to look if I ever forget something.\n- I am at the beginning of my learning adventures. When I look back at it, I will know where I came from and how my thoughts evolved over time.\n- Plus, its really fun to nerd out.\n\n## Structure of this wiki\n\n- [[slipbox.Ontology]] explains the structure of this wiki and the tags, backlinks used in it.\n- Dendron takes care of the structure and hierarchy(mostly), but I insist on using tags for backwards compatibility.\n\n## Quicklinks\n\n- [[About me|archive.about]]\n- [Github](https://github.com/zubayrrr)\n- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/zoobhalu)\n- [Blog](https://zubayrali.in)\n- [Guestbook](https://www.yourworldoftext.com/~zubayrali/)\n"},"collectionChildren":null,"customHeadContent":null,"config":{"version":5,"dev":{"enablePreviewV2":true,"enableSelfContainedVaults":true},"commands":{"lookup":{"note":{"selectionMode":"extract","confirmVaultOnCreate":true,"vaultSelectionModeOnCreate":"smart","leaveTrace":false,"bubbleUpCreateNew":true,"fuzzThreshold":0.2}},"randomNote":{},"insertNoteLink":{"aliasMode":"none","enableMultiSelect":false},"insertNoteIndex":{"enableMarker":false},"copyNoteLink":{},"templateHierarchy":"template","insertNote":{"initialValue":"templates"}},"workspace":{"vaults":[{"fsPath":".","selfContained":true,"name":"Dendron"}],"journal":{"dailyDomain":"daily","name":"journal","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd","addBehavior":"childOfDomain"},"scratch":{"name":"scratch","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd.HHmmss","addBehavior":"asOwnDomain"},"task":{"name":"task","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd","addBehavior":"asOwnDomain","statusSymbols":{"":" ","wip":"w","done":"x","assigned":"a","moved":"m","blocked":"b","delegated":"l","dropped":"d","pending":"y"},"taskCompleteStatus":["done","x"],"prioritySymbols":{"H":"high","M":"medium","L":"low"},"todoIntegration":false,"createTaskSelectionType":"selection2link"},"graph":{"zoomSpeed":1,"createStub":false},"enableAutoCreateOnDefinition":false,"enableHandlebarTemplates":true,"enableXVaultWikiLink":false,"enableRemoteVaultInit":true,"enableUserTags":true,"enableHashTags":true,"workspaceVaultSyncMode":"noCommit","enableAutoFoldFrontmatter":false,"enableEditorDecorations":true,"maxPreviewsCached":10,"maxNoteLength":204800,"enableFullHierarchyNoteTitle":false,"enableSmartRefs":true},"preview":{"enableFMTitle":true,"enableNoteTitleForLink":true,"enableFrontmatterTags":true,"enableHashesForFMTags":false,"enableMermaid":true,"enablePrettyRefs":true,"enableKatex":true,"automaticallyShowPreview":false},"publishing":{"theme":"dark","enableFMTitle":true,"enableNoteTitleForLink":true,"enableMermaid":true,"enablePrettyRefs":true,"enableKatex":true,"copyAssets":true,"siteHierarchies":["root"],"writeStubs":false,"siteRootDir":"docs","seo":{"title":"Noetic Noggin","description":"Personal Wiki / Digital Garden","author":"Zubayr Ali","twitter":"zoobhalu"},"github":{"enableEditLink":false,"editLinkText":"Edit this page on GitHub","editBranch":"main","editViewMode":"tree"},"enableSiteLastModified":true,"enableFrontmatterTags":true,"enableHashesForFMTags":false,"enableRandomlyColoredTags":true,"enableTaskNotes":true,"enablePrettyLinks":true,"siteUrl":"localhost:3000","siteFaviconPath":"favicon.ico","siteIndex":"root"}}},"__N_SSG":true}
