decision based on the destination address portion of the packet. It then looks up the destination address in its routing table. If the destination address is within a known network/subnetwork, the router forwards the packet to the next hop gateway for that destination network/subnetwork. Once the packet leaves the router, it is the responsibility of the next hop gateway to forward the packet to its final destination. If the router does not have the destination network in its routing table, it may forward the packet to a predetermined default gateway if configured and let the default gateway handle getting the packet to the destination network or it will drop the packet and inform the sending host that the network is not reachable.</p>\n<p>The routing table is a list of networks that router knows about. It can learn these routes by 3 means: a routing protocol such as; <a href=\"/notes/47kqarif53fgm4mn91r2kcg\">RIP</a>, <a href=\"/notes/jqwe0nqc1h9ulnmhbxbgmhe\">IGRP</a>, and <a href=\"/notes/613csq7phgdc2zr0y6ny2bv\">OSPF</a>, a static route that has been manually been set by a network administrator, or by being directly connected to that network on one of its interfaces.</p>\n<p>The routing table will contain many pieces of information about the learned network, but the main information is the network address and the next hop gateway.</p>\n<p>The network address can be either a full class network address or a subnetwork address, depending on the netmask being used. The next hop gateway is the ip address of the gateway to hand off the outbound packet to.</p>\n<p>Keep in mind that all of the routers must know of a way to reach each other. The receiving host must have a path to get back to the sending host in order for data to pass.</p>\n<p>Via — <a href=\"http://penta2.ufrgs.br/trouble/ts_ip.htm\">Basic IP Addressing and

Welcome to Noetic Noggin\n\nThis is [[my|archive.about]] personal wiki and a commonplace book; notes by me, for me.\n\n🚧 Permanently under construction 🚧\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/zubayr/image/upload/v1658499909/wiki/ajevkuyebljlxiblyst2.png)\n\nThis wiki was made possible with [dendron.so](https://dendron.so) and [obisidian.md](https://obsidian.md). Stored on [Github Repository](https://github.com/zubayrrr/dendron) and hosted on [Netlify](https://netlify.com) for free.\n\n## Principles\n\n### All notes should be relative to me.\n\n- All notes in principle are written for me; what I know about a subject, how I feel about a particular thing.\n- Opinions are fine as long as I feel strong epistemic confidence in the given opinion.\n- Don't over explain a note if it's not necessary, remember, these notes are for you and are relative to whatever knowledge you posses about the subject.\n- Read books and make an dedicated notes for them.\n- Listen podcasts but capture them inside a \"subject specific\" note or \"Map of Concept\" note or a note tagged #areas. Because making notes from podcasts can be tedious as they're not as well structured as books for consumption.(Whose merit is debatable.)\n- #areas are basically \"Map of Concept\" notes but I have recently come to the realization that its better to maintain them [Nikita Voloboev style](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/) but with heavy usage of transclusion and backlinking.\n  - \"Resources\" should be first processed and then mentioned inside the note, otherwise they should be left in inbox.\n\n### Gotta capture 'em all\n\n- Hog whatever information tickles your pickle([anything that gratifies one's intellectual curiosity](https://news.ycombinator.com/newsguidelines.html)).\n- [[swipes]] are interesting/useful bits of... [[quotes|swipes.quotes]], [[excerpts|swipes.excerpts]], [[sayings|swipes.sayings]], [[phrases|swipes.phrases]]. Essentially, ideas, opinions that are swiped off from [[others|resources.people]].\n- Make no distinction between \"your\" ideas and ideas of \"others\", because if you vibe with an idea; it's already yours.\n- But also remember \"If you've time to consume, you've time to produce.\".\n- Use [raindrop.io](https://raindrop.io) to manage your URL bookmarks.\n- If you need to bookmark a webpage or an article all together, use [MarkDownload](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/markdownload-markdown-web/pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi?hl=en-GB) to rip the entire page. Let's call it a [[webmark|inbox.webmark]]; it belong in the `/inbox`.\n- Similar process is employed for capturing tweets using [tweet-to-markdown](https://github.com/kbravh/tweet-to-markdown) and it also belongs in the `/inbox`.\n\n### Don't force evolution\n\n- Let your second brain evolve at it's own pace.\n- The structure should never be _too_ rigid because its meant to take form by itself.\n\n### Noise & Signal\n\n- While capturing ideas left and right is recommended, make sure you're not harming your periods of focus.\n- Have impenetrable focus periods (use Pomodoro method) where you only care about the work on hand and nothing else.\n\n### Why do any of this?\n\n- Because I can't remember everything - there's a lot of information around that interests me and there isn't enough working memory installed in me.\n- So, I make notes - to remember, to create, to meditate, to think.\n- A bodybuilder's portfolio is their body - my portfolio is my wiki.\n- Not only am I making - whatever I know - tangible by writing it down. I know exactly where to look if I ever forget something.\n- I am at the beginning of my learning adventures. When I look back at it, I will know where I came from and how my thoughts evolved over time.\n- Plus, its really fun to nerd out.\n\n## Structure of this wiki\n\n- [[slipbox.Ontology]] explains the structure of this wiki and the tags, backlinks used in it.\n- Dendron takes care of the structure and hierarchy(mostly), but I insist on using tags for backwards compatibility.\n\n## Quicklinks\n\n- [[About me|archive.about]]\n- [Github](https://github.com/zubayrrr)\n- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/zoobhalu)\n- [Blog](https://zubayrali.in)\n- [Guestbook](https://www.yourworldoftext.com/~zubayrali/)\n"},"collectionChildren":null,"customHeadContent":null,"config":{"version":5,"dev":{"enablePreviewV2":true,"enableSelfContainedVaults":true},"commands":{"lookup":{"note":{"selectionMode":"extract","confirmVaultOnCreate":true,"vaultSelectionModeOnCreate":"smart","leaveTrace":false,"bubbleUpCreateNew":true,"fuzzThreshold":0.2}},"randomNote":{},"insertNoteLink":{"aliasMode":"none","enableMultiSelect":false},"insertNoteIndex":{"enableMarker":false},"copyNoteLink":{},"templateHierarchy":"template","insertNote":{"initialValue":"templates"}},"workspace":{"vaults":[{"fsPath":".","selfContained":true,"name":"Dendron"}],"journal":{"dailyDomain":"daily","name":"journal","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd","addBehavior":"childOfDomain"},"scratch":{"name":"scratch","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd.HHmmss","addBehavior":"asOwnDomain"},"task":{"name":"task","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd","addBehavior":"asOwnDomain","statusSymbols":{"":" ","wip":"w","done":"x","assigned":"a","moved":"m","blocked":"b","delegated":"l","dropped":"d","pending":"y"},"taskCompleteStatus":["done","x"],"prioritySymbols":{"H":"high","M":"medium","L":"low"},"todoIntegration":false,"createTaskSelectionType":"selection2link"},"graph":{"zoomSpeed":1,"createStub":false},"enableAutoCreateOnDefinition":false,"enableHandlebarTemplates":true,"enableXVaultWikiLink":false,"enableRemoteVaultInit":true,"enableUserTags":true,"enableHashTags":true,"workspaceVaultSyncMode":"noCommit","enableAutoFoldFrontmatter":false,"enableEditorDecorations":true,"maxPreviewsCached":10,"maxNoteLength":204800,"enableFullHierarchyNoteTitle":false,"enableSmartRefs":true},"preview":{"enableFMTitle":true,"enableNoteTitleForLink":true,"enableFrontmatterTags":true,"enableHashesForFMTags":false,"enableMermaid":true,"enablePrettyRefs":true,"enableKatex":true,"automaticallyShowPreview":false},"publishing":{"theme":"dark","enableFMTitle":true,"enableNoteTitleForLink":true,"enableMermaid":true,"enablePrettyRefs":true,"enableKatex":true,"copyAssets":true,"siteHierarchies":["root"],"writeStubs":false,"siteRootDir":"docs","seo":{"title":"Noetic Noggin","description":"Personal Wiki / Digital Garden","author":"Zubayr Ali","twitter":"zoobhalu"},"github":{"enableEditLink":false,"editLinkText":"Edit this page on GitHub","editBranch":"main","editViewMode":"tree"},"enableSiteLastModified":true,"enableFrontmatterTags":true,"enableHashesForFMTags":false,"enableRandomlyColoredTags":true,"enableTaskNotes":true,"enablePrettyLinks":true,"siteUrl":"localhost:3000","siteFaviconPath":"favicon.ico","siteIndex":"root"}}},"__N_SSG":true}
