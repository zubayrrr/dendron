Units are categorized by the type of resource they represent and they are defined with files known as unit files. The type of each unit can be inferred from the suffix on the end of the file.</p>\n<p>Although it is technically correct to classify a unit as a service, in systemd, units tend to be more abstract and often comprised of resource pools, filesystem mounts, network protocols, devices, and native Linux services.</p>\n<p>Units are defined in a file known as a Unit file. Systemd can manage unit files from any location, but their main location is <code>/etc/systemd/system</code> directory. Unit files in this directory are mainly user-provided. Compared to other locations, the systemd manager will assign higher precedence to unit files within the above directory.</p>\n<pre><code>sudo systemctl list-units\n\n# or\n\nsudo systemctl list-units --all\n\n# to show all installed unit files\n\nsudo systemctl list-unit-files\n</code></pre>\n<p>The following are the unit files found in systemd.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>.service</strong> – Service unit files define how systemd manages a service. They typically end in .service extension. Service unit files describe how to start, stop, reload and restart a service and the dependencies required to manage the service.</li>\n<li><strong>.target</strong> – Target units provide synchronization points to other services during startup.</li>\n<li><strong>.slice</strong> – slice unit files encode information about systemd slice units. Slice units are part of the Linux control group tree that allows resource allocation and restriction to processes associated with a slice. You can learn more about systemd resource control <a href=\"https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.resource-control.html\">here</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>.socket</strong> – A socket unit file encodes information about network socket, IPC, or a file system FIFO buffer controlled and managed for systemd, which systemd uses for socket-based activation.</li>\n<li><strong>.device</strong> – Device unit configurations define a device unit as exposed in the sysfs/udev device tree.</li>\n<li><strong>.timer</strong> – Timer units define a timer managed and controlled by systemd for scheduled activation.</li>\n<li><strong>.snapshot</strong> – Snapshot unit files allow rollback of the current state of the system after making changes. We create them using the systemd snapshot command.</li>\n<li><strong>.swap</strong> – Swap units encode information about swap space, such as the device name or path of the swap space.</li>\n<li><strong>.mount</strong> – mount unit files encode information about mount points in the system managed by systemd.</li>\n<li><strong>.automount</strong> – these are unit files that define mount points that are automatically mounted.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"systemctl\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading\" href=\"#systemctl\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\"><use xlink:href=\"#svg-link\"></use></svg></a>systemctl</h2>\n<p><code>systemctl</code> is a Linux command-line utility used to control and manage systemd and services. You can think of Systemctl as a control interface for Systemd init service, allowing you to communicate with systemd and perform operations.</p>\n<p>Systemctl is a successor of Init.d system; it contains libraries, daemons, and utilities you can use to manage services in the Linux system.</p>\n<p>To start a <code>systemd</code> service, executing instructions in the service’s unit file, use the <code>start</code> command. If you are running as a non-root user, you will have to use <code>sudo</code> since this will affect the state of the operating system:</p>\n<pre><code>sudo systemctl start application.service\n\n# or you can skip .service\n\nsudo systemctl start application\n</code></pre>\n<p>To stop/restart</p>\n<pre><code>sudo systemctl stop application\nsudo systemctl restart application\n</code></pre>\n<p>restart vs reload</p>\n<p><code>restart</code> will terminate the service in question and restart it; <code>reload</code> will only reload the configuration file of the service. Not all services might support <code>reload</code> in which case you can use <code>reload-or-restart</code></p>\n<p>To check status</p>\n<pre><code>sudo systemctl status application\n</code></pre>\n<p>To enable or disable</p>\n<p><code>enable</code> will enable a service to start automatically at boot time vice versa for <code>disable</code>\ncheck with <code>is-enabled</code> (these settings only take place at boot time and won’t effect current session)</p>\n<pre><code>sudo systemctl enable application\n</code></pre>\n<p>To see a unit’s dependency tree</p>\n<pre><code>systemctl list-dependencies sshd.service\n</code></pre>\n<p>Masking</p>\n<p><code>systemd</code> also has the ability to mark a unit as <em>completely</em> unstartable, automatically or manually, by linking it to <code>/dev/null</code>. This is called masking the unit, and is possible with the <code>mask</code> command:</p>\n<p>This will prevent the Nginx service from being started, automatically or manually, for as long as it is masked.</p>\n<pre><code>sudo systemctl mask nginx.service\n\n# to unmask\n\nsudo systemctl unmask nginx.service\n</code></pre>\n<h2 id=\"references\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading\"

Welcome to Noetic Noggin\n\nThis is [[my|archive.about]] personal wiki and a commonplace book; notes by me, for me.\n\n🚧 Permanently under construction 🚧\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/zubayr/image/upload/v1658499909/wiki/ajevkuyebljlxiblyst2.png)\n\nThis wiki was made possible with [dendron.so](https://dendron.so) and [obisidian.md](https://obsidian.md). Stored on [Github Repository](https://github.com/zubayrrr/dendron) and hosted on [Netlify](https://netlify.com) for free.\n\n## Principles\n\n### All notes should be relative to me.\n\n- All notes in principle are written for me; what I know about a subject, how I feel about a particular thing.\n- Opinions are fine as long as I feel strong epistemic confidence in the given opinion.\n- Don't over explain a note if it's not necessary, remember, these notes are for you and are relative to whatever knowledge you posses about the subject.\n- Read books and make an dedicated notes for them.\n- Listen podcasts but capture them inside a \"subject specific\" note or \"Map of Concept\" note or a note tagged #areas. Because making notes from podcasts can be tedious as they're not as well structured as books for consumption.(Whose merit is debatable.)\n- #areas are basically \"Map of Concept\" notes but I have recently come to the realization that its better to maintain them [Nikita Voloboev style](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/) but with heavy usage of transclusion and backlinking.\n  - \"Resources\" should be first processed and then mentioned inside the note, otherwise they should be left in inbox.\n\n### Gotta capture 'em all\n\n- Hog whatever information tickles your pickle([anything that gratifies one's intellectual curiosity](https://news.ycombinator.com/newsguidelines.html)).\n- [[swipes]] are interesting/useful bits of... [[quotes|swipes.quotes]], [[excerpts|swipes.excerpts]], [[sayings|swipes.sayings]], [[phrases|swipes.phrases]]. Essentially, ideas, opinions that are swiped off from [[others|resources.people]].\n- Make no distinction between \"your\" ideas and ideas of \"others\", because if you vibe with an idea; it's already yours.\n- But also remember \"If you've time to consume, you've time to produce.\".\n- Use [raindrop.io](https://raindrop.io) to manage your URL bookmarks.\n- If you need to bookmark a webpage or an article all together, use [MarkDownload](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/markdownload-markdown-web/pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi?hl=en-GB) to rip the entire page. Let's call it a [[webmark|inbox.webmark]]; it belong in the `/inbox`.\n- Similar process is employed for capturing tweets using [tweet-to-markdown](https://github.com/kbravh/tweet-to-markdown) and it also belongs in the `/inbox`.\n\n### Don't force evolution\n\n- Let your second brain evolve at it's own pace.\n- The structure should never be _too_ rigid because its meant to take form by itself.\n\n### Noise & Signal\n\n- While capturing ideas left and right is recommended, make sure you're not harming your periods of focus.\n- Have impenetrable focus periods (use Pomodoro method) where you only care about the work on hand and nothing else.\n\n### Why do any of this?\n\n- Because I can't remember everything - there's a lot of information around that interests me and there isn't enough working memory installed in me.\n- So, I make notes - to remember, to create, to meditate, to think.\n- A bodybuilder's portfolio is their body - my portfolio is my wiki.\n- Not only am I making - whatever I know - tangible by writing it down. I know exactly where to look if I ever forget something.\n- I am at the beginning of my learning adventures. When I look back at it, I will know where I came from and how my thoughts evolved over time.\n- Plus, its really fun to nerd out.\n\n## Structure of this wiki\n\n- [[slipbox.Ontology]] explains the structure of this wiki and the tags, backlinks used in it.\n- Dendron takes care of the structure and hierarchy(mostly), but I insist on using tags for backwards compatibility.\n\n## Quicklinks\n\n- [[About me|archive.about]]\n- [Github](https://github.com/zubayrrr)\n- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/zoobhalu)\n- [Blog](https://zubayrali.in)\n- [Guestbook](https://www.yourworldoftext.com/~zubayrali/)\n"},"collectionChildren":null,"customHeadContent":null,"config":{"version":5,"dev":{"enablePreviewV2":true,"enableSelfContainedVaults":true},"commands":{"lookup":{"note":{"selectionMode":"extract","confirmVaultOnCreate":true,"vaultSelectionModeOnCreate":"smart","leaveTrace":false,"bubbleUpCreateNew":true,"fuzzThreshold":0.2}},"randomNote":{},"insertNoteLink":{"aliasMode":"none","enableMultiSelect":false},"insertNoteIndex":{"enableMarker":false},"copyNoteLink":{},"templateHierarchy":"template","insertNote":{"initialValue":"templates"}},"workspace":{"vaults":[{"fsPath":".","selfContained":true,"name":"Dendron"}],"journal":{"dailyDomain":"daily","name":"journal","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd","addBehavior":"childOfDomain"},"scratch":{"name":"scratch","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd.HHmmss","addBehavior":"asOwnDomain"},"task":{"name":"task","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd","addBehavior":"asOwnDomain","statusSymbols":{"":" ","wip":"w","done":"x","assigned":"a","moved":"m","blocked":"b","delegated":"l","dropped":"d","pending":"y"},"taskCompleteStatus":["done","x"],"prioritySymbols":{"H":"high","M":"medium","L":"low"},"todoIntegration":false,"createTaskSelectionType":"selection2link"},"graph":{"zoomSpeed":1,"createStub":false},"enableAutoCreateOnDefinition":false,"enableHandlebarTemplates":true,"enableXVaultWikiLink":false,"enableRemoteVaultInit":true,"enableUserTags":true,"enableHashTags":true,"workspaceVaultSyncMode":"noCommit","enableAutoFoldFrontmatter":false,"enableEditorDecorations":true,"maxPreviewsCached":10,"maxNoteLength":204800,"enableFullHierarchyNoteTitle":false,"enableSmartRefs":true},"preview":{"enableFMTitle":true,"enableNoteTitleForLink":true,"enableFrontmatterTags":true,"enableHashesForFMTags":false,"enableMermaid":true,"enablePrettyRefs":true,"enableKatex":true,"automaticallyShowPreview":false},"publishing":{"theme":"dark","enableFMTitle":true,"enableNoteTitleForLink":true,"enableMermaid":true,"enablePrettyRefs":true,"enableKatex":true,"copyAssets":true,"siteHierarchies":["root"],"writeStubs":false,"siteRootDir":"docs","seo":{"title":"Noetic Noggin","description":"Personal Wiki / Digital Garden","author":"Zubayr Ali","twitter":"zoobhalu"},"github":{"enableEditLink":false,"editLinkText":"Edit this page on GitHub","editBranch":"main","editViewMode":"tree"},"enableSiteLastModified":true,"enableFrontmatterTags":true,"enableHashesForFMTags":false,"enableRandomlyColoredTags":true,"enableTaskNotes":true,"enablePrettyLinks":true,"siteUrl":"localhost:3000","siteFaviconPath":"favicon.ico","siteIndex":"root"}}},"__N_SSG":true}
