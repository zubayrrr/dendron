It is a portable artifact that can be easily shared and moved around. <a href=\"/notes/wf37vjntme0oklsx52ycrn4\">Docker</a>, <a title=\"Private\" style=\"color: brown\" href=\"https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/hfyvYGJZQiUwQaaxQO27q.html\" target=\"_blank\">devlog.containerd (Private)</a>, <a title=\"Private\" style=\"color: brown\" href=\"https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/hfyvYGJZQiUwQaaxQO27q.html\" target=\"_blank\">devlog.cri-o (Private)</a> are some examples of container technologies. Containers have existed before Docker.</p>\n<p>Containerized applications are applications that run in isolated runtime environments called containers. Containers encapsulate an application with all its dependencies, including system libraries, binaries, and configuration files.</p>\n<p>An application packaged together with its dependencies that runs on top of an OS in an isolated instance and uses the kernel from the host OS.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Containers are often referred to as “lightweight,” meaning they share the machine’s operating system kernel and do not require the overhead of associating an operating system within each application. Containers are inherently smaller in capacity than a <a href=\"/notes/j4lsu8mr5jevc5ykg01ak67\">VM</a> and require less start-up time, allowing far more containers to run on the same compute capacity as a single VM. This drives higher server efficiencies and, in turn, reduces server and licensing costs.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Put simply, containerization allows applications to be “written once and run anywhere.” This portability is important in terms of the development process and vendor compatibility. It also offers other notable benefits, like fault isolation, ease of management and security, to name a few. — via <a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/in-en/cloud/learn/containerization\">Containerization Explained - India | IBM</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"where-do-containers-live\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading\" href=\"#where-do-containers-live\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\"><use xlink:href=\"#svg-link\"></use></svg></a>Where do containers live?</h2>\n<p>?\nThey're stored in a container repository. Public or Private repositories. DockerHub is a public repository. You can use <a href=\"/notes/vxce41k3oxe2gxzgenry4lj\">Nexus</a> as a private repository.</p>\n<h2 id=\"container-vs-image\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading\" href=\"#container-vs-image\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\"><use xlink:href=\"#svg-link\"></use></svg></a>Container VS Image</h2>\n<p>?\nTechnically, a container is made up of images, layers of images stacked on top of each other.\nAt the base of the image, you'd usually have a Linux as the Base Image. It could be <code>alpine</code> or any other distro of Linux, it is important for these Base Images to be small to make sure container stays small in size.</p>\n<p>The application image is usually the top layer.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>An image is a standalone, isolated, lightweight and executable package that contains\nall the required components (code, runtime, system tools, libraries, settings, etc)\nnecessary to run an application. An image is the actual, moveable artifact.</li>\n<li>The container is the runtime instance of the image. From the same image, you can launch more containers.\nImages for many applications can be found on <a href=\"https://hub.docker.com\">https://hub.docker.com</a></li>\n<li>An image \"becomes\" a container when we actually start an image. It creates a container environment.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"containers-vs-vm\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading\" href=\"#containers-vs-vm\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\"><use xlink:href=\"#svg-link\"></use></svg></a>Containers VS VM</h2>\n<p>?\n<img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/zubayr/image/upload/v1657820046/wiki/rbvrr2wexsbxl8yuddgp.png\"></p>\n<p>Docker virtualizes applications layer. Cannot run Linux based images on Windows kernel(which can be mitigated by install Docker Toolbox to abstract away the kernel layer).</p>\n<p>VM virtualizes both applications and OS kernel layer(entire OS). Can run on any host OS.</p>\n<h2 id=\"docker-images\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading\" href=\"#docker-images\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\"><use xlink:href=\"#svg-link\"></use></svg></a>Docker Images</h2>\n<p><strong>Docker image</strong> is an immutable (unchangeable) file that contains the source code, libraries, dependencies, tools, and other files needed for an application to run.</p>\n<p>Due to their <strong>read-only</strong> quality, these images are sometimes referred to as snapshots. They represent an application and its virtual environment at a specific point in time. This consistency is one of the great features of Docker. It allows developers to test and experiment software in stable, uniform conditions.</p>\n<p>Since images are, in a way, just <strong>templates</strong>, you cannot start or run them. What you can do is use that template as a base to build a container. A container is, ultimately, just a running image. Once you create a container, it adds a writable layer on top of the immutable image, meaning you can now modify it.</p>\n<p>The image-base on which you create a container exists separately and cannot be altered. When you run a containerized environment, you essentially create a <strong>read-write copy</strong> of that filesystem (docker image) inside the container. This adds a <strong>container layer</strong> which allows modifications of the entire copy of the image.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/zubayr/image/upload/v1657821563/wiki/pshjskltg9vpslfynuvj.png\"></p>\n<p>You can create an unlimited number of Docker images from one <strong>image base</strong>. Each time you change the initial state of an image and save the existing state, you create a new template with an additional layer on top of it.</p>\n<p>Docker images can, therefore, consist of a <strong>series of layers</strong>, each differing but also originating from the previous one. Image layers represent read-only files to which a container layer is added once you use it to start up a virtual environment.</p>\n<h2 id=\"docker-container\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading\" href=\"#docker-container\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\"><use xlink:href=\"#svg-link\"></use></svg></a>Docker Container</h2>\n<p>A Docker container is a virtualized run-time environment where users can isolate applications from the underlying system. These containers are compact, portable units in which you can start up an application quickly and easily.</p>\n<p>A valuable feature is the standardization of the computing environment running inside the container. Not only does it ensure your application is working in identical circumstances, but it also simplifies sharing with other teammates.</p>\n<p>As containers are autonomous, they provide strong isolation, ensuring they do not interrupt other running containers, as well as the server that supports them. Docker claims that these units “provide the strongest isolation capabilities in the industry”. Therefore, you won’t have to worry about keeping your machine secure while developing an application.</p>\n<p>Unlike virtual machines (VMs) where virtualization happens at the hardware level, containers virtualize at the app layer. They can utilize one machine, share its kernel, and virtualize the operating system to run isolated processes. This makes containers extremely lightweight, allowing you to retain valuable resources.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/assets/images/containers%20and%20vms.png\" alt=\"Containers and Virtual Machines

Welcome to Noetic Noggin\n\nThis is [[my|archive.about]] personal wiki and a commonplace book; notes by me, for me.\n\n🚧 Permanently under construction 🚧\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/zubayr/image/upload/v1658499909/wiki/ajevkuyebljlxiblyst2.png)\n\nThis wiki was made possible with [dendron.so](https://dendron.so) and [obisidian.md](https://obsidian.md). Stored on [Github Repository](https://github.com/zubayrrr/dendron) and hosted on [Netlify](https://netlify.com) for free.\n\n## Principles\n\n### All notes should be relative to me.\n\n- All notes in principle are written for me; what I know about a subject, how I feel about a particular thing.\n- Opinions are fine as long as I feel strong epistemic confidence in the given opinion.\n- Don't over explain a note if it's not necessary, remember, these notes are for you and are relative to whatever knowledge you posses about the subject.\n- Read books and make an dedicated notes for them.\n- Listen podcasts but capture them inside a \"subject specific\" note or \"Map of Concept\" note or a note tagged #areas. Because making notes from podcasts can be tedious as they're not as well structured as books for consumption.(Whose merit is debatable.)\n- #areas are basically \"Map of Concept\" notes but I have recently come to the realization that its better to maintain them [Nikita Voloboev style](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/) but with heavy usage of transclusion and backlinking.\n  - \"Resources\" should be first processed and then mentioned inside the note, otherwise they should be left in inbox.\n\n### Gotta capture 'em all\n\n- Hog whatever information tickles your pickle([anything that gratifies one's intellectual curiosity](https://news.ycombinator.com/newsguidelines.html)).\n- [[swipes]] are interesting/useful bits of... [[quotes|swipes.quotes]], [[excerpts|swipes.excerpts]], [[sayings|swipes.sayings]], [[phrases|swipes.phrases]]. Essentially, ideas, opinions that are swiped off from [[others|resources.people]].\n- Make no distinction between \"your\" ideas and ideas of \"others\", because if you vibe with an idea; it's already yours.\n- But also remember \"If you've time to consume, you've time to produce.\".\n- Use [raindrop.io](https://raindrop.io) to manage your URL bookmarks.\n- If you need to bookmark a webpage or an article all together, use [MarkDownload](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/markdownload-markdown-web/pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi?hl=en-GB) to rip the entire page. Let's call it a [[webmark|inbox.webmark]]; it belong in the `/inbox`.\n- Similar process is employed for capturing tweets using [tweet-to-markdown](https://github.com/kbravh/tweet-to-markdown) and it also belongs in the `/inbox`.\n\n### Don't force evolution\n\n- Let your second brain evolve at it's own pace.\n- The structure should never be _too_ rigid because its meant to take form by itself.\n\n### Noise & Signal\n\n- While capturing ideas left and right is recommended, make sure you're not harming your periods of focus.\n- Have impenetrable focus periods (use Pomodoro method) where you only care about the work on hand and nothing else.\n\n### Why do any of this?\n\n- Because I can't remember everything - there's a lot of information around that interests me and there isn't enough working memory installed in me.\n- So, I make notes - to remember, to create, to meditate, to think.\n- A bodybuilder's portfolio is their body - my portfolio is my wiki.\n- Not only am I making - whatever I know - tangible by writing it down. I know exactly where to look if I ever forget something.\n- I am at the beginning of my learning adventures. When I look back at it, I will know where I came from and how my thoughts evolved over time.\n- Plus, its really fun to nerd out.\n\n## Structure of this wiki\n\n- [[slipbox.Ontology]] explains the structure of this wiki and the tags, backlinks used in it.\n- Dendron takes care of the structure and hierarchy(mostly), but I insist on using tags for backwards compatibility.\n\n## Quicklinks\n\n- [[About me|archive.about]]\n- [Github](https://github.com/zubayrrr)\n- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/zoobhalu)\n- [Blog](https://zubayrali.in)\n- [Guestbook](https://www.yourworldoftext.com/~zubayrali/)\n"},"collectionChildren":null,"customHeadContent":null,"config":{"version":5,"dev":{"enablePreviewV2":true,"enableSelfContainedVaults":true},"commands":{"lookup":{"note":{"selectionMode":"extract","confirmVaultOnCreate":true,"vaultSelectionModeOnCreate":"smart","leaveTrace":false,"bubbleUpCreateNew":true,"fuzzThreshold":0.2}},"randomNote":{},"insertNoteLink":{"aliasMode":"none","enableMultiSelect":false},"insertNoteIndex":{"enableMarker":false},"copyNoteLink":{},"templateHierarchy":"template","insertNote":{"initialValue":"templates"}},"workspace":{"vaults":[{"fsPath":".","selfContained":true,"name":"Dendron"}],"journal":{"dailyDomain":"daily","name":"journal","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd","addBehavior":"childOfDomain"},"scratch":{"name":"scratch","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd.HHmmss","addBehavior":"asOwnDomain"},"task":{"name":"task","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd","addBehavior":"asOwnDomain","statusSymbols":{"":" ","wip":"w","done":"x","assigned":"a","moved":"m","blocked":"b","delegated":"l","dropped":"d","pending":"y"},"taskCompleteStatus":["done","x"],"prioritySymbols":{"H":"high","M":"medium","L":"low"},"todoIntegration":false,"createTaskSelectionType":"selection2link"},"graph":{"zoomSpeed":1,"createStub":false},"enableAutoCreateOnDefinition":false,"enableHandlebarTemplates":true,"enableXVaultWikiLink":false,"enableRemoteVaultInit":true,"enableUserTags":true,"enableHashTags":true,"workspaceVaultSyncMode":"noCommit","enableAutoFoldFrontmatter":false,"enableEditorDecorations":true,"maxPreviewsCached":10,"maxNoteLength":204800,"enableFullHierarchyNoteTitle":false,"enableSmartRefs":true},"preview":{"enableFMTitle":true,"enableNoteTitleForLink":true,"enableFrontmatterTags":true,"enableHashesForFMTags":false,"enableMermaid":true,"enablePrettyRefs":true,"enableKatex":true,"automaticallyShowPreview":false},"publishing":{"theme":"dark","enableFMTitle":true,"enableNoteTitleForLink":true,"enableMermaid":true,"enablePrettyRefs":true,"enableKatex":true,"copyAssets":true,"siteHierarchies":["root"],"writeStubs":false,"siteRootDir":"docs","seo":{"title":"Noetic Noggin","description":"Personal Wiki / Digital Garden","author":"Zubayr Ali","twitter":"zoobhalu"},"github":{"enableEditLink":false,"editLinkText":"Edit this page on GitHub","editBranch":"main","editViewMode":"tree"},"enableSiteLastModified":true,"enableFrontmatterTags":true,"enableHashesForFMTags":false,"enableRandomlyColoredTags":true,"enableTaskNotes":true,"enablePrettyLinks":true,"siteUrl":"localhost:3000","siteFaviconPath":"favicon.ico","siteIndex":"root"}}},"__N_SSG":true}
