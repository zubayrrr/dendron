However, there are some additional species of the genus Ephedra we can use to produce this medicine. This preparation was used in traditional Chinese medicine for about 2000 years. However, it is now considered as an unsafe preparation because scientists have found that the dietary supplements containing the alkaloids of Ephedra can cause dangerous side effects, even death.</p>\n<p>Different species of Ephedra genus contains different alkaloid and non-alkaloid compounds including ephedrine and pseudoephedrine. These compounds are sources of the stimulant and thermogenic effects of Ephedra. These components can stimulate the brain, increasing the heart rate by constricting the blood vessels and expanding the bronchial tubes. The thermogenic properties of Ephedra can cause an increase in <a href=\"https://www.differencebetween.com/difference-between-biotransformation-and-metabolism/#Metabolism\">metabolism</a> and can increase blood heat.</p>\n<p><img src=\"inbox/assets/Difference%20Between%20Ephedra%20and%20Ephedrine.jpeg\" alt=\"Difference Between Ephedra and Ephedrine\"></p>\n<p><strong>Figure 01: Ephedra in Bottles</strong></p>\n<p>More importantly, we can observe that athletes tend to consume this medicine as a performance-enhancing drug, though there is no evidence of Ephedra improving athletic performance. In addition, this medicine has been used in the past as a weight-loss aid, in combination with caffeine and <a href=\"https://www.differencebetween.com/difference-between-aspirin-and-vs-tylenol-acetaminophen/\">aspirin</a>.</p>\n<p>The adverse side effects of Ephedra include skin reactions, irritability, nervousness, dizziness, trembling, headache, insomnia, dehydration, itchy scalp, and skin, hyperthermia, etc. The dangerous side effects of this drug may include irregular heartbeat, seizures, heart attack, stroke, and even death.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-is-ephedrine\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading\" href=\"#what-is-ephedrine\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\"><use xlink:href=\"#svg-link\"></use></svg></a>What is Ephedrine?</h2>\n<p>Ephedrine is a medication and a stimulant that is useful in preventing low blood pressure during spinal anaesthesia. We can also use this drug to treat asthma, narcolepsy, and obesity. The route of administration preferred for this drug is the mouth, but we can take it as an injection into a muscle, vein, or just under the skin as well. The intravenous injection is the fastest route of administration into the body. Taking the medication from the mouth can take it hours to give the preferred effect.</p>\n<p><img src=\"inbox/assets/Key%20Difference%20-%20Ephedra%20vs%20Ephedrine.png\" alt=\"Key Difference - Ephedra vs Ephedrine\"></p>\n<p><strong>Figure 02: Isomers of Ephedrine</strong></p>\n<p>There are some common side effects of ephedrine, including trouble sleeping, anxiety, headache, hallucinations, high blood pressure, fast heart rate, loss of appetite, and inability to urinate. Moreover, there are some adverse side effects as well, e.g. stroke, heart attack, and abuse.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-are-the-similarities-between-ephedra-and-ephedrine\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading\" href=\"#what-are-the-similarities-between-ephedra-and-ephedrine\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\"><use xlink:href=\"#svg-link\"></use></svg></a>What are the Similarities Between Ephedra and Ephedrine?</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Both are important medications.</li>\n<li>We can prepare them from the plants of some species of the genus Ephedra.</li>\n<li>These medications can act as stimulants.</li>\n<li>They have some serious side effects as well.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Ephedra and ephedrine are medications and are stimulants.

Welcome to Noetic Noggin\n\nThis is [[my|archive.about]] personal wiki and a commonplace book; notes by me, for me.\n\n🚧 Permanently under construction 🚧\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/zubayr/image/upload/v1658499909/wiki/ajevkuyebljlxiblyst2.png)\n\nThis wiki was made possible with [dendron.so](https://dendron.so) and [obisidian.md](https://obsidian.md). Stored on [Github Repository](https://github.com/zubayrrr/dendron) and hosted on [Netlify](https://netlify.com) for free.\n\n## Principles\n\n### All notes should be relative to me.\n\n- All notes in principle are written for me; what I know about a subject, how I feel about a particular thing.\n- Opinions are fine as long as I feel strong epistemic confidence in the given opinion.\n- Don't over explain a note if it's not necessary, remember, these notes are for you and are relative to whatever knowledge you posses about the subject.\n- Read books and make an dedicated notes for them.\n- Listen podcasts but capture them inside a \"subject specific\" note or \"Map of Concept\" note or a note tagged #areas. Because making notes from podcasts can be tedious as they're not as well structured as books for consumption.(Whose merit is debatable.)\n- #areas are basically \"Map of Concept\" notes but I have recently come to the realization that its better to maintain them [Nikita Voloboev style](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/) but with heavy usage of transclusion and backlinking.\n  - \"Resources\" should be first processed and then mentioned inside the note, otherwise they should be left in inbox.\n\n### Gotta capture 'em all\n\n- Hog whatever information tickles your pickle([anything that gratifies one's intellectual curiosity](https://news.ycombinator.com/newsguidelines.html)).\n- [[swipes]] are interesting/useful bits of... [[quotes|swipes.quotes]], [[excerpts|swipes.excerpts]], [[sayings|swipes.sayings]], [[phrases|swipes.phrases]]. Essentially, ideas, opinions that are swiped off from [[others|resources.people]].\n- Make no distinction between \"your\" ideas and ideas of \"others\", because if you vibe with an idea; it's already yours.\n- But also remember \"If you've time to consume, you've time to produce.\".\n- Use [raindrop.io](https://raindrop.io) to manage your URL bookmarks.\n- If you need to bookmark a webpage or an article all together, use [MarkDownload](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/markdownload-markdown-web/pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi?hl=en-GB) to rip the entire page. Let's call it a [[webmark|inbox.webmark]]; it belong in the `/inbox`.\n- Similar process is employed for capturing tweets using [tweet-to-markdown](https://github.com/kbravh/tweet-to-markdown) and it also belongs in the `/inbox`.\n\n### Don't force evolution\n\n- Let your second brain evolve at it's own pace.\n- The structure should never be _too_ rigid because its meant to take form by itself.\n\n### Noise & Signal\n\n- While capturing ideas left and right is recommended, make sure you're not harming your periods of focus.\n- Have impenetrable focus periods (use Pomodoro method) where you only care about the work on hand and nothing else.\n\n### Why do any of this?\n\n- Because I can't remember everything - there's a lot of information around that interests me and there isn't enough working memory installed in me.\n- So, I make notes - to remember, to create, to meditate, to think.\n- A bodybuilder's portfolio is their body - my portfolio is my wiki.\n- Not only am I making - whatever I know - tangible by writing it down. I know exactly where to look if I ever forget something.\n- I am at the beginning of my learning adventures. When I look back at it, I will know where I came from and how my thoughts evolved over time.\n- Plus, its really fun to nerd out.\n\n## Structure of this wiki\n\n- [[slipbox.Ontology]] explains the structure of this wiki and the tags, backlinks used in it.\n- Dendron takes care of the structure and hierarchy(mostly), but I insist on using tags for backwards compatibility.\n\n## Quicklinks\n\n- [[About me|archive.about]]\n- [Github](https://github.com/zubayrrr)\n- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/zoobhalu)\n- [Blog](https://zubayrali.in)\n- [Guestbook](https://www.yourworldoftext.com/~zubayrali/)\n"},"collectionChildren":null,"customHeadContent":null,"config":{"version":5,"dev":{"enablePreviewV2":true,"enableSelfContainedVaults":true},"commands":{"lookup":{"note":{"selectionMode":"extract","confirmVaultOnCreate":true,"vaultSelectionModeOnCreate":"smart","leaveTrace":false,"bubbleUpCreateNew":true,"fuzzThreshold":0.2}},"randomNote":{},"insertNoteLink":{"aliasMode":"none","enableMultiSelect":false},"insertNoteIndex":{"enableMarker":false},"copyNoteLink":{},"templateHierarchy":"template","insertNote":{"initialValue":"templates"}},"workspace":{"vaults":[{"fsPath":".","selfContained":true,"name":"Dendron"}],"journal":{"dailyDomain":"daily","name":"journal","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd","addBehavior":"childOfDomain"},"scratch":{"name":"scratch","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd.HHmmss","addBehavior":"asOwnDomain"},"task":{"name":"task","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd","addBehavior":"asOwnDomain","statusSymbols":{"":" ","wip":"w","done":"x","assigned":"a","moved":"m","blocked":"b","delegated":"l","dropped":"d","pending":"y"},"taskCompleteStatus":["done","x"],"prioritySymbols":{"H":"high","M":"medium","L":"low"},"todoIntegration":false,"createTaskSelectionType":"selection2link"},"graph":{"zoomSpeed":1,"createStub":false},"enableAutoCreateOnDefinition":false,"enableHandlebarTemplates":true,"enableXVaultWikiLink":false,"enableRemoteVaultInit":true,"enableUserTags":true,"enableHashTags":true,"workspaceVaultSyncMode":"noCommit","enableAutoFoldFrontmatter":false,"enableEditorDecorations":true,"maxPreviewsCached":10,"maxNoteLength":204800,"enableFullHierarchyNoteTitle":false,"enableSmartRefs":true},"preview":{"enableFMTitle":true,"enableNoteTitleForLink":true,"enableFrontmatterTags":true,"enableHashesForFMTags":false,"enableMermaid":true,"enablePrettyRefs":true,"enableKatex":true,"automaticallyShowPreview":false},"publishing":{"theme":"dark","enableFMTitle":true,"enableNoteTitleForLink":true,"enableMermaid":true,"enablePrettyRefs":true,"enableKatex":true,"copyAssets":true,"siteHierarchies":["root"],"writeStubs":false,"siteRootDir":"docs","seo":{"title":"Noetic Noggin","description":"Personal Wiki / Digital Garden","author":"Zubayr Ali","twitter":"zoobhalu"},"github":{"enableEditLink":false,"editLinkText":"Edit this page on GitHub","editBranch":"main","editViewMode":"tree"},"enableSiteLastModified":true,"enableFrontmatterTags":true,"enableHashesForFMTags":false,"enableRandomlyColoredTags":true,"enableTaskNotes":true,"enablePrettyLinks":true,"siteUrl":"localhost:3000","siteFaviconPath":"favicon.ico","siteIndex":"root"}}},"__N_SSG":true}
