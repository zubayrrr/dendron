The goals are <em>breadth</em> (everything important), <em>specificity</em> (give concrete examples of the most common case), and <em>brevity</em> (avoid things that aren't essential or digressions you can easily look up elsewhere). Every tip is essential in some situation or significantly saves time over alternatives.</li>\n<li>This is written for Linux, with the exception of the \"<a href=\"https://github.com/#macos-only\">macOS only</a>\" and \"<a href=\"https://github.com/#windows-only\">Windows only</a>\" sections.

You're smart enough to look up more detail elsewhere once you know the idea or command to Google.

Actually, type <code>man bash</code> and at least skim the whole thing; it's pretty easy to follow and not that long. Alternate shells can be nice, but Bash is powerful and always available (learning <em>only</em> zsh, fish, etc., while tempting on your own laptop, restricts you in many situations, such as using existing servers).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Learn at least one text-based editor well. The <code>nano</code> editor is one of the simplest for basic editing (opening, editing, saving, searching). However, for the power user in a text terminal, there is no substitute for Vim (<code>vi</code>), the hard-to-learn but venerable, fast, and full-featured editor. Many people also use the classic Emacs, particularly for larger editing tasks. (Of course, any modern software developer working on an extensive project is unlikely to use only a pure text-based editor and should also be familiar with modern graphical IDEs and tools.)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Finding documentation:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Know how to read official documentation with <code>man</code> (for the inquisitive, <code>man man</code> lists the section numbers, e.g. 1 is \"regular\" commands, 5 is files/conventions, and 8 are for administration). Find man pages with <code>apropos</code>.</li>\n<li>Know that some commands are not executables, but Bash builtins, and that you can get help on them with <code>help</code> and <code>help -d</code>. You can find out whether a command is an executable, shell builtin or an alias by using <code>type command</code>.</li>\n<li><code>curl cheat.sh/command</code> will give a brief \"cheat sheet\" with common examples of how to use a shell command.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Learn about redirection of output and input using <code>></code> and <code>&#x3C;</code> and pipes using <code>|</code>. Know <code>></code> overwrites the output file and <code>>></code> appends. Learn about stdout and stderr.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Learn about file glob expansion with <code>*</code> (and perhaps <code>?</code> and <code>[</code>...<code>]</code>) and quoting and the difference between double <code>\"</code> and single <code>'</code> quotes. (See more on variable expansion below.)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Be familiar with Bash job management: <code>&#x26;</code>, <strong>ctrl-z</strong>, <strong>ctrl-c</strong>, <code>jobs</code>, <code>fg</code>, <code>bg</code>, <code>kill</code>, etc.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Know <code>ssh</code>, and the basics of passwordless authentication, via <code>ssh-agent</code>, <code>ssh-add</code>, etc.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Basic file management: <code>ls</code> and <code>ls -l</code> (in particular, learn what every column in <code>ls -l</code> means), <code>less</code>, <code>head</code>, <code>tail</code> and <code>tail -f</code> (or even better, <code>less +F</code>), <code>ln</code> and <code>ln -s</code> (learn the differences and advantages of hard versus soft links), <code>chown</code>, <code>chmod</code>, <code>du</code> (for a quick summary of disk usage: <code>du -hs *</code>). For filesystem management, <code>df</code>, <code>mount</code>, <code>fdisk</code>, <code>mkfs</code>, <code>lsblk</code>. Learn what an inode is (<code>ls -i</code> or <code>df -i</code>).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Basic network management: <code>ip</code> or <code>ifconfig</code>, <code>dig</code>, <code>traceroute</code>, <code>route</code>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Learn and use a version control management system, such as <code>git</code>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Know regular expressions well, and the various flags to <code>grep</code>/<code>egrep</code>. The <code>-i</code>, <code>-o</code>, <code>-v</code>, <code>-A</code>, <code>-B</code>, and <code>-C</code> options are worth knowing.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Learn to use <code>apt-get</code>, <code>yum</code>, <code>dnf</code> or <code>pacman</code> (depending on distro) to find and install packages. And make sure you have <code>pip</code> to install Python-based command-line tools (a few below are easiest to install via <code>pip</code>).</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"everyday-use\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading\" href=\"#everyday-use\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\"><use xlink:href=\"#svg-link\"></use></svg></a>Everyday use</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>In Bash, use <strong>Tab</strong> to complete arguments or list all available commands and <strong>ctrl-r</strong> to search through command history (after pressing, type to search, press <strong>ctrl-r</strong> repeatedly to cycle through more matches, press <strong>Enter</strong> to execute the found command, or hit the right arrow to put the result in the current line to allow editing).</li>\n<li>In Bash, use <strong>ctrl-w</strong> to delete the last word, and <strong>ctrl-u</strong> to delete the content from current cursor back to the start of the line. Use <strong>alt-b</strong> and <strong>alt-f</strong> to move by word, <strong>ctrl-a</strong> to move cursor to beginning of line, <strong>ctrl-e</strong> to move cursor to end of line, <strong>ctrl-k</strong> to kill to the end of the line, <strong>ctrl-l</strong> to clear the screen. See <code>man readline</code> for all the default keybindings in Bash. There are a lot. For example <strong>alt-.</strong> cycles through previous arguments, and <strong>alt-</strong>* expands a glob.</li>\n<li>Alternatively, if you love vi-style key-bindings, use <code>set -o vi</code> (and <code>set -o emacs</code> to put it back).</li>\n<li>For editing long commands, after setting your editor (for example <code>export EDITOR=vim</code>), <strong>ctrl-x</strong> <strong>ctrl-e</strong> will open the current command in an editor for multi-line editing. Or in vi style, <strong>escape-v</strong>.</li>\n<li>To see recent commands, use <code>history</code>. Follow with <code>!n</code> (where <code>n</code> is the command number) to execute again. There are also many abbreviations you can use, the most useful probably being `!---\ntags:</li>\n<li>articles</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<h1 id=\"github---jlevythe-art-of-command-line-master-the-command-line-in-one-page-2\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading\" href=\"#github---jlevythe-art-of-command-line-master-the-command-line-in-one-page-2\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\"><use xlink:href=\"#svg-link\"></use></svg></a><a href=\"https://github.com/jlevy/the-art-of-command-line\">GitHub - jlevy/the-art-of-command-line: Master the command line, in one page</a></h1>\n<p> for last argument and <code>!!</code> for last command (see \"HISTORY EXPANSION\" in the man page). However, these are often easily replaced with <strong>ctrl-r</strong> and <strong>alt-.</strong>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Go to your home directory with <code>cd</code>. Access files relative to your home directory with the <code>~</code> prefix (e.g. <code>~/.bashrc</code>). In <code>sh</code> scripts refer to the home directory as <code>$HOME</code>.</li>\n<li>To go back to the previous working directory: <code>cd -</code>.</li>\n<li>If you are halfway through typing a command but change your mind, hit <strong>alt-#</strong> to add a <code>#</code> at the beginning and enter it as a comment (or use <strong>ctrl-a</strong>, <strong>#</strong>, <strong>enter</strong>). You can then return to it later via command history.</li>\n<li>Use <code>xargs</code> (or <code>parallel</code>). It's very powerful. Note you can control how many items execute per line (<code>-L</code>) as well as parallelism (<code>-P</code>). If you're not sure if it'll do the right thing, use <code>xargs echo</code> first. Also, <code>-I{}</code> is handy. Examples:</li>\n</ul>\n<pre><code>  find . -name '\\*.py' | xargs grep some\\_function\n  cat hosts | xargs -I{} ssh root@{} hostname\n</code></pre>\n<ul>\n<li><code>pstree -p</code> is a helpful display of the process tree.</li>\n<li>Use <code>pgrep</code> and <code>pkill</code> to find or signal processes by name (<code>-f</code> is helpful).</li>\n<li>Know the various signals you can send processes. For example, to suspend a process, use <code>kill -STOP [pid]</code>. For the full list, see <code>man 7 signal</code></li>\n<li>Use <code>nohup</code> or <code>disown</code> if you want a background process to keep running forever.</li>\n<li>Check what processes are listening via <code>netstat -lntp</code> or <code>ss -plat</code> (for TCP; add <code>-u</code> for UDP) or <code>lsof -iTCP -sTCP:LISTEN -P -n</code> (which also works on macOS).</li>\n<li>See also <code>lsof</code> and <code>fuser</code> for open sockets and files.</li>\n<li>See <code>uptime</code> or <code>w</code> to know how long the system has been running.</li>\n<li>Use <code>alias</code> to create shortcuts for commonly used commands. For example, <code>alias ll='ls -latr'</code> creates a new alias <code>ll</code>.</li>\n<li>Save aliases, shell settings, and functions you commonly use in <code>~/.bashrc</code>, and <a href=\"http://superuser.com/a/183980/7106\">arrange for login shells to source it</a>. This will make your setup available in all your shell sessions.</li>\n<li>Put the settings of environment variables as well as commands that should be executed when you login in <code>~/.bash_profile</code>. Separate configuration will be needed for shells you launch from graphical environment logins and <code>cron</code> jobs.</li>\n<li>Synchronize your configuration files (e.g. <code>.bashrc</code> and <code>.bash_profile</code>) among various computers with Git.</li>\n<li>Understand that care is needed when variables and filenames include whitespace. Surround your Bash variables with quotes, e.g. <code>\"$FOO\"</code>. Prefer the <code>-0</code> or <code>-print0</code> options to enable null characters to delimit filenames, e.g. <code>locate -0 pattern | xargs -0 ls -al</code> or <code>find / -print0 -type d | xargs -0 ls -al</code>. To iterate on filenames containing whitespace in a for loop, set your IFS to be a newline only using <code>IFS=\\n'</code>.</li>\n<li>In Bash scripts, use <code>set -x</code> (or the variant <code>set -v</code>, which logs raw input, including unexpanded variables and comments) for debugging output. Use strict modes unless you have a good reason not to: Use <code>set -e</code> to abort on errors (nonzero exit code). Use <code>set -u</code> to detect unset variable usages. Consider <code>set -o pipefail</code> too, to abort on errors within pipes (though read up on it more if you do, as this topic is a bit subtle). For more involved scripts, also use <code>trap</code> on EXIT or ERR. A useful habit is to start a script like this, which will make it detect and abort on common errors and print a message:</li>\n</ul>\n<pre><code>  set -euo pipefail\n  trap \"echo 'error: Script failed: see failed command above'\" ERR\n</code></pre>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>In Bash scripts, subshells (written with parentheses) are convenient ways to group commands. A common example is to temporarily move to a different working directory, e.g.</p>\n<h1 id=\"do-something-in-current-dir\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading\" href=\"#do-something-in-current-dir\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\"><use xlink:href=\"#svg-link\"></use></svg></a>do something in current dir</h1>\n<p>  (cd /some/other/dir &#x26;&#x26; other-command)</p>\n<h1 id=\"continue-in-original-dir\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading\" href=\"#continue-in-original-dir\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\"><use xlink:href=\"#svg-link\"></use></svg></a>continue in original dir</h1>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>In Bash, note there are lots of kinds of variable expansion. Checking a variable exists: <code>${name:?error message}</code>. For example, if a Bash script requires a single argument, just write <code>input_file=${1:?usage: $0 input_file}</code>. Using a default value if a variable is empty: <code>${name:-default}</code>. If you want to have an additional (optional) parameter added to the previous example, you can use something like <code>output_file=${2:-logfile}</code>. If <code>$2</code> is omitted and thus empty, <code>output_file</code> will be set to <code>logfile</code>. Arithmetic expansion: <code>i=$(( (i + 1) % 5 ))</code>. Sequences: <code>{1..10}</code>. Trimming of strings: <code>${var%suffix}</code> and <code>${var#prefix}</code>. For example if <code>var=foo.pdf</code>, then <code>echo ${var%.pdf}.txt</code> prints <code>foo.txt</code>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Brace expansion using <code>{</code>...<code>}</code> can reduce having to re-type similar text and automate combinations of items. This is helpful in examples like <code>mv foo.{txt,pdf} some-dir</code> (which moves both files), <code>cp somefile{,.bak}</code> (which expands to <code>cp somefile somefile.bak</code>) or <code>mkdir -p test-{a,b,c}/subtest-{1,2,3}</code> (which expands all possible combinations and creates a directory tree). Brace expansion is performed before any other expansion.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The order of expansions is: brace expansion; tilde expansion, parameter and variable expansion, arithmetic expansion, and command substitution (done in a left-to-right fashion); word splitting; and filename expansion. (For example, a range like <code>{1..20}</code> cannot be expressed with variables using <code>{$a..$b}</code>. Use <code>seq</code> or a <code>for</code> loop instead, e.g., <code>seq $a $b</code> or <code>for((i=a; i&#x3C;=b; i++)); do ... ; done</code>.)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The output of a command can be treated like a file via <code>&#x3C;(some command)</code> (known as process substitution). For example, compare local <code>/etc/hosts</code> with a remote one:</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<pre><code>  diff /etc/hosts &#x3C;(ssh somehost cat /etc/hosts)\n</code></pre>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>When writing scripts you may want to put all of your code in curly braces. If the closing brace is missing, your script will be prevented from executing due to a syntax error. This makes sense when your script is going to be downloaded from the web, since it prevents partially downloaded scripts from executing:</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A \"here document\" allows <a href=\"https://www.tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/here-docs.html\">redirection of multiple lines of input</a> as if from a file:</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<pre><code>cat &#x3C;&#x3C;EOF\ninput\non multiple lines\nEOF\n</code></pre>\n<ul>\n<li>In Bash, redirect both standard output and standard error via: <code>some-command >logfile 2>&#x26;1</code> or <code>some-command &#x26;>logfile</code>. Often, to ensure a command does not leave an open file handle to standard input, tying it to the terminal you are in, it is also good practice to add <code>&#x3C;/dev/null</code>.</li>\n<li>Use <code>man ascii</code> for a good ASCII table, with hex and decimal values. For general encoding info, <code>man unicode</code>, <code>man utf-8</code>, and <code>man latin1</code> are helpful.</li>\n<li>Use <code>screen</code> or <a href=\"https://tmux.github.io/\"><code>tmux</code></a> to multiplex the screen, especially useful on remote ssh sessions and to detach and re-attach to a session. <code>byobu</code> can enhance screen or tmux by providing more information and easier management. A more minimal alternative for session persistence only is <a href=\"https://github.com/bogner/dtach\"><code>dtach</code></a>.</li>\n<li>In ssh, knowing how to port tunnel with <code>-L</code> or <code>-D</code> (and occasionally <code>-R</code>) is useful, e.g. to access web sites from a remote server.</li>\n<li>It can be useful to make a few optimizations to your ssh configuration; for example, this <code>~/.ssh/config</code> contains settings to avoid dropped connections in certain network environments, uses compression (which is helpful with scp over low-bandwidth connections), and multiplex channels to the same server with a local control file:</li>\n</ul>\n<pre><code>      TCPKeepAlive=yes\n      ServerAliveInterval=15\n      ServerAliveCountMax=6\n      Compression=yes\n      ControlMaster auto\n      ControlPath /tmp/%r@%h:%p\n      ControlPersist yes\n</code></pre>\n<ul>\n<li>A few other options relevant to ssh are security sensitive and should be enabled with care, e.g. per subnet or host or in trusted networks: <code>StrictHostKeyChecking=no</code>, <code>ForwardAgent=yes</code></li>\n<li>Consider <a href=\"https://mosh.mit.edu/\"><code>mosh</code></a> an alternative to ssh that uses UDP, avoiding dropped connections and adding convenience on the road (requires server-side setup).</li>\n<li>To get the permissions on a file in octal form, which is useful for system configuration but not available in <code>ls</code> and easy to bungle, use something like</li>\n</ul>\n<pre><code>  stat -c '%A %a %n' /etc/timezone\n</code></pre>\n<ul>\n<li>For interactive selection of values from the output of another command, use <a href=\"https://github.com/mooz/percol\"><code>percol</code></a> or <a href=\"https://github.com/junegunn/fzf\"><code>fzf</code></a>.</li>\n<li>For interaction with files based on the output of another command (like <code>git</code>), use <code>fpp</code> (<a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/PathPicker\">PathPicker</a>).</li>\n<li>For a simple web server for all files in the current directory (and subdirs), available to anyone on your network, use: <code>python -m SimpleHTTPServer 7777</code> (for port 7777 and Python 2) and <code>python -m http.server 7777</code> (for port 7777 and Python 3).</li>\n<li>For running a command as another user, use <code>sudo</code>. Defaults to running as root; use <code>-u</code> to specify another user. Use <code>-i</code> to login as that user (you will be asked for <em>your</em> password).</li>\n<li>For switching the shell to another user, use <code>su username</code> or <code>su - username</code>. The latter with \"-\" gets an environment as if another user just logged in. Omitting the username defaults to root. You will be asked for the password <em>of the user you are switching to</em>.</li>\n<li>Know about the <a href=\"https://wiki.debian.org/CommonErrorMessages/ArgumentListTooLong\">128K limit</a> on command lines. This \"Argument list too long\" error is common when wildcard matching large numbers of files. (When this happens alternatives like <code>find</code> and <code>xargs</code> may help.)</li>\n<li>For a basic calculator (and of course access to Python in general), use the <code>python</code> interpreter. For example,</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"processing-files-and-data\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading\" href=\"#processing-files-and-data\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\"><use xlink:href=\"#svg-link\"></use></svg></a>Processing files and data</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>To locate a file by name in the current directory, <code>find . -iname '*something*'</code> (or similar). To find a file anywhere by name, use <code>locate something</code> (but bear in mind <code>updatedb</code> may not have indexed recently created files).</li>\n<li>For general searching through source or data files, there are several options more advanced or faster than <code>grep -r</code>, including (in rough order from older to newer) <a href=\"https://github.com/beyondgrep/ack2\"><code>ack</code></a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher\"><code>ag</code></a> (\"the silver searcher\"), and <a href=\"https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep\"><code>rg</code></a> (ripgrep).</li>\n<li>To convert HTML to text: <code>lynx -dump -stdin</code></li>\n<li>For Markdown, HTML, and all kinds of document conversion, try <a href=\"http://pandoc.org/\"><code>pandoc</code></a>. For example, to convert a Markdown document to Word format: <code>pandoc README.md --from markdown --to docx -o temp.docx</code></li>\n<li>If you must handle XML, <code>xmlstarlet</code> is old but good.</li>\n<li>For JSON, use <a href=\"http://stedolan.github.io/jq/\"><code>jq</code></a>. For interactive use, also see <a href=\"https://github.com/simeji/jid\"><code>jid</code></a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/fiatjaf/jiq\"><code>jiq</code></a>.</li>\n<li>For YAML, use <a href=\"https://github.com/0k/shyaml\"><code>shyaml</code></a>.</li>\n<li>For Excel or CSV files, <a href=\"https://github.com/onyxfish/csvkit\">csvkit</a> provides <code>in2csv</code>, <code>csvcut</code>, <code>csvjoin</code>, <code>csvgrep</code>, etc.</li>\n<li>For Amazon S3, <a href=\"https://github.com/s3tools/s3cmd\"><code>s3cmd</code></a> is convenient and <a href=\"https://github.com/bloomreach/s4cmd\"><code>s4cmd</code></a> is faster. Amazon's <a href=\"https://github.com/aws/aws-cli\"><code>aws</code></a> and the improved <a href=\"https://github.com/donnemartin/saws\"><code>saws</code></a> are essential for other AWS-related tasks.</li>\n<li>Know about <code>sort</code> and <code>uniq</code>, including uniq's <code>-u</code> and <code>-d</code> options -- see one-liners below. See also <code>comm</code>.</li>\n<li>Know about <code>cut</code>, <code>paste</code>, and <code>join</code> to manipulate text files. Many people use <code>cut</code> but forget about <code>join</code>.</li>\n<li>Know about <code>wc</code> to count newlines (<code>-l</code>), characters (<code>-m</code>), words (<code>-w</code>) and bytes (<code>-c</code>).</li>\n<li>Know about <code>tee</code> to copy from stdin to a file and also to stdout, as in <code>ls -al | tee file.txt</code>.</li>\n<li>For more complex calculations, including grouping, reversing fields, and statistical calculations, consider <a href=\"https://www.gnu.org/software/datamash/\"><code>datamash</code></a>.</li>\n<li>Know that locale affects a lot of command line tools in subtle ways, including sorting order (collation) and performance. Most Linux installations will set <code>LANG</code> or other locale variables to a local setting like US English. But be aware sorting will change if you change locale. And know i18n routines can make sort or other commands run <em>many times</em> slower. In some situations (such as the set operations or uniqueness operations below) you can safely ignore slow i18n routines entirely and use traditional byte-based sort order, using <code>export LC_ALL=C</code>.</li>\n<li>You can set a specific command's environment by prefixing its invocation with the environment variable settings, as in <code>TZ=Pacific/Fiji date</code>.</li>\n<li>Know basic <code>awk</code> and <code>sed</code> for simple data munging. See <a href=\"https://github.com/#one-liners\">One-liners</a> for examples.</li>\n<li>To replace all occurrences of a string in place, in one or more files:</li>\n</ul>\n<pre><code>  perl -pi.bak -e 's/old-string/new-string/g' my-files-\\*.txt\n</code></pre>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>To rename multiple files and/or search and replace within files, try <a href=\"https://github.com/jlevy/repren\"><code>repren</code></a>. (In some cases the <code>rename</code> command also allows multiple renames, but be careful as its functionality is not the same on all Linux distributions.)</p>\n<h1 id=\"full-rename-of-filenames-directories-and-contents-foo---bar\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading\" href=\"#full-rename-of-filenames-directories-and-contents-foo---bar\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\"><use xlink:href=\"#svg-link\"></use></svg></a>Full rename of filenames, directories, and contents foo -> bar:</h1>\n<p>  repren --full --preserve-case --from foo --to bar .</p>\n<h1 id=\"recover-backup-files-whateverbak---whatever\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading\" href=\"#recover-backup-files-whateverbak---whatever\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\"><use xlink:href=\"#svg-link\"></use></svg></a>Recover backup files whatever.bak -> whatever:</h1>\n<p>  repren --renames --from '(.*)\\.bak' --to '\\1' *.bak</p>\n<h1 id=\"same-as-above-using-rename-if-available\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading\" href=\"#same-as-above-using-rename-if-available\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\"><use xlink:href=\"#svg-link\"></use></svg></a>Same as above, using rename, if available:</h1>\n<p>  rename 's/\\.bak$//' *.bak</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>As the man page says, <code>rsync</code> really is a fast and extraordinarily versatile file copying tool. It's known for synchronizing between machines but is equally useful locally. When security restrictions allow, using <code>rsync</code> instead of <code>scp</code> allows recovery of a transfer without restarting from scratch. It also is among the <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20130929001850/http://linuxnote.net/jianingy/en/linux/a-fast-way-to-remove-huge-number-of-files.html\">fastest ways</a> to delete large numbers of files:</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>mkdir empty &#x26;&#x26; rsync -r --delete empty/ some-dir &#x26;&#x26; rmdir some-dir</p>\n<ul>\n<li>For monitoring progress when processing files, use <a href=\"http://www.ivarch.com/programs/pv.shtml\"><code>pv</code></a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/dmerejkowsky/pycp\"><code>pycp</code></a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/dspinellis/pmonitor\"><code>pmonitor</code></a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/Xfennec/progress\"><code>progress</code></a>, <code>rsync --progress</code>, or, for block-level copying, <code>dd status=progress</code>.</li>\n<li>Use <code>shuf</code> to shuffle or select random lines from a file.</li>\n<li>Know <code>sort</code>'s options. For numbers, use <code>-n</code>, or <code>-h</code> for handling human-readable numbers (e.g. from <code>du -h</code>). Know how keys work (<code>-t</code> and <code>-k</code>). In particular, watch out that you need to write <code>-k1,1</code> to sort by only the first field; <code>-k1</code> means sort according to the whole line. Stable sort (<code>sort -s</code>) can be useful. For example, to sort first by field 2, then secondarily by field 1, you can use <code>sort -k1,1 | sort -s -k2,2</code>.</li>\n<li>If you ever need to write a tab literal in a command line in Bash (e.g. for the -t argument to sort), press <strong>ctrl-v</strong> <strong>[Tab]</strong> or write <code>\\t'</code> (the latter is better as you can copy/paste it).</li>\n<li>The standard tools for patching source code are <code>diff</code> and <code>patch</code>. See also <code>diffstat</code> for summary statistics of a diff and <code>sdiff</code> for a side-by-side diff. Note <code>diff -r</code> works for entire directories. Use <code>diff -r tree1 tree2 | diffstat</code> for a summary of changes. Use <code>vimdiff</code> to compare and edit files.</li>\n<li>For binary files, use <code>hd</code>, <code>hexdump</code> or <code>xxd</code> for simple hex dumps and <code>bvi</code>, <code>hexedit</code> or <code>biew</code> for binary editing.</li>\n<li>Also for binary files, <code>strings</code> (plus <code>grep</code>, etc.) lets you find bits of text.</li>\n<li>For binary diffs (delta compression), use <code>xdelta3</code>.</li>\n<li>To convert text encodings, try <code>iconv</code>. Or <code>uconv</code> for more advanced use; it supports some advanced Unicode things. For example:</li>\n</ul>\n<pre><code>  # Displays hex codes or actual names of characters (useful for debugging):\n  uconv -f utf-8 -t utf-8 -x '::Any-Hex;' &#x3C; input.txt\n  uconv -f utf-8 -t utf-8 -x '::Any-Name;' &#x3C; input.txt\n  # Lowercase and removes all accents (by expanding and dropping them):\n  uconv -f utf-8 -t utf-8 -x '::Any-Lower; ::Any-NFD; \\[:Nonspacing Mark:\\] >; ::Any-NFC;' &#x3C; input.txt \\> output.txt\n</code></pre>\n<ul>\n<li>To split files into pieces, see <code>split</code> (to split by size) and <code>csplit</code> (to split by a pattern).</li>\n<li>Date and time: To get the current date and time in the helpful <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601\">ISO 8601</a> format, use <code>date -u +\"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ\"</code> (other options <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7216358/date-command-on-os-x-doesnt-have-iso-8601-i-option\">are</a> <a href=\"https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/164826/date-command-iso-8601-option\">problematic</a>). To manipulate date and time expressions, use <code>dateadd</code>, <code>datediff</code>, <code>strptime</code> etc. from <a href=\"http://www.fresse.org/dateutils/\"><code>dateutils</code></a>.</li>\n<li>Use <code>zless</code>, <code>zmore</code>, <code>zcat</code>, and <code>zgrep</code> to operate on compressed files.</li>\n<li>File attributes are settable via <code>chattr</code> and offer a lower-level alternative to file permissions. For example, to protect against accidental file deletion the immutable flag: <code>sudo chattr +i /critical/directory/or/file</code></li>\n<li>Use <code>getfacl</code> and <code>setfacl</code> to save and restore file permissions. For example:</li>\n</ul>\n<p>   getfacl -R /some/path > permissions.txt\nsetfacl --restore=permissions.txt</p>\n<ul>\n<li>To create empty files quickly, use <code>truncate</code> (creates <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparse_file\">sparse file</a>), <code>fallocate</code> (ext4, xfs, btrfs and ocfs2 filesystems), <code>xfs_mkfile</code> (almost any filesystems, comes in xfsprogs package), <code>mkfile</code> (for Unix-like systems like Solaris, Mac OS).</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"system-debugging\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading\" href=\"#system-debugging\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\"><use xlink:href=\"#svg-link\"></use></svg></a>System debugging</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>For web debugging, <code>curl</code> and <code>curl -I</code> are handy, or their <code>wget</code> equivalents, or the more modern <a href=\"https://github.com/jkbrzt/httpie\"><code>httpie</code></a>.</li>\n<li>To know current cpu/disk status, the classic tools are <code>top</code> (or the better <code>htop</code>), <code>iostat</code>, and <code>iotop</code>. Use <code>iostat -mxz 15</code> for basic CPU and detailed per-partition disk stats and performance insight.</li>\n<li>For network connection details, use <code>netstat</code> and <code>ss</code>.</li>\n<li>For a quick overview of what's happening on a system, <code>dstat</code> is especially useful. For broadest overview with details, use <a href=\"https://github.com/nicolargo/glances\"><code>glances</code></a>.</li>\n<li>To know memory status, run and understand the output of <code>free</code> and <code>vmstat</code>. In particular, be aware the \"cached\" value is memory held by the Linux kernel as file cache, so effectively counts toward the \"free\" value.</li>\n<li>Java system debugging is a different kettle of fish, but a simple trick on Oracle's and some other JVMs is that you can run <code>kill -3 &#x3C;pid></code> and a full stack trace and heap summary (including generational garbage collection details, which can be highly informative) will be dumped to stderr/logs. The JDK's <code>jps</code>, <code>jstat</code>, <code>jstack</code>, <code>jmap</code> are useful. <a href=\"https://github.com/aragozin/jvm-tools\">SJK tools</a> are more advanced.</li>\n<li>Use <a href=\"http://www.bitwizard.nl/mtr/\"><code>mtr</code></a> as a better traceroute, to identify network issues.</li>\n<li>For looking at why a disk is full, <a href=\"https://dev.yorhel.nl/ncdu\"><code>ncdu</code></a> saves time over the usual commands like <code>du -sh *</code>.</li>\n<li>To find which socket or process is using bandwidth, try <a href=\"http://www.ex-parrot.com/~pdw/iftop/\"><code>iftop</code></a> or <a href=\"https://github.com/raboof/nethogs\"><code>nethogs</code></a>.</li>\n<li>The <code>ab</code> tool (comes with Apache) is helpful for quick-and-dirty checking of web server performance. For more complex load testing, try <code>siege</code>.</li>\n<li>For more serious network debugging, <a href=\"https://wireshark.org/\"><code>wireshark</code></a>, <a href=\"https://www.wireshark.org/docs/wsug_html_chunked/AppToolstshark.html\"><code>tshark</code></a>, or <a href=\"http://ngrep.sourceforge.net/\"><code>ngrep</code></a>.</li>\n<li>Know about <code>strace</code> and <code>ltrace</code>. These can be helpful if a program is failing, hanging, or crashing, and you don't know why, or if you want to get a general idea of performance. Note the profiling option (<code>-c</code>), and the ability to attach to a running process (<code>-p</code>). Use trace child option (<code>-f</code>) to avoid missing important calls.</li>\n<li>Know about <code>ldd</code> to check shared libraries etc — but <a href=\"http://www.catonmat.net/blog/ldd-arbitrary-code-execution/\">never run it on untrusted files</a>.</li>\n<li>Know how to connect to a running process with <code>gdb</code> and get its stack traces.</li>\n<li>Use <code>/proc</code>. It's amazingly helpful sometimes when debugging live problems. Examples: <code>/proc/cpuinfo</code>, <code>/proc/meminfo</code>, <code>/proc/cmdline</code>, <code>/proc/xxx/cwd</code>, <code>/proc/xxx/exe</code>, <code>/proc/xxx/fd/</code>, <code>/proc/xxx/smaps</code> (where <code>xxx</code> is the process id or pid).</li>\n<li>When debugging why something went wrong in the past, <a href=\"http://sebastien.godard.pagesperso-orange.fr/\"><code>sar</code></a> can be very helpful. It shows historic statistics on CPU, memory, network, etc.</li>\n<li>For deeper systems and performance analyses, look at <code>stap</code> (<a href=\"https://sourceware.org/systemtap/wiki\">SystemTap</a>), <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perf_%28Linux%29\"><code>perf</code></a>, and <a href=\"https://github.com/draios/sysdig\"><code>sysdig</code></a>.</li>\n<li>Check what OS you're on with <code>uname</code> or <code>uname -a</code> (general Unix/kernel info) or <code>lsb_release -a</code> (Linux distro info).</li>\n<li>Use <code>dmesg</code> whenever something's acting really funny (it could be hardware or driver issues).</li>\n<li>If you delete a file and it doesn't free up expected disk space as reported by <code>du</code>, check whether the file is in use by a process: <code>lsof | grep deleted | grep \"filename-of-my-big-file\"</code></li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"one-liners\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading\" href=\"#one-liners\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\"><use xlink:href=\"#svg-link\"></use></svg></a>One-liners</h2>\n<p>A few examples of piecing together commands:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>It is remarkably helpful sometimes that you can do set intersection, union, and difference of text files via <code>sort</code>/<code>uniq</code>. Suppose <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> are text files that are already uniqued. This is fast, and works on files of arbitrary size, up to many gigabytes. (Sort is not limited by memory, though you may need to use the <code>-T</code> option if <code>/tmp</code> is on a small root partition.) See also the note about <code>LC_ALL</code> above and <code>sort</code>'s <code>-u</code> option (left out for clarity below).</p>\n<p>  sort a b | uniq > c   # c is a union b\nsort a b | uniq -d > c   # c is a intersect b\nsort a b b | uniq -u > c   # c is set difference a - b</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Pretty-print two JSON files, normalizing their syntax, then coloring and paginating the result:</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<pre><code>      diff &#x3C;(jq --sort-keys . &#x3C; file1.json) &#x3C;(jq --sort-keys . &#x3C; file2.json) | colordiff | less -R\n</code></pre>\n<ul>\n<li>Use <code>grep . *</code> to quickly examine the contents of all files in a directory (so each line is paired with the filename), or <code>head -100 *</code> (so each file has a heading).

Welcome to Noetic Noggin\n\nThis is [[my|archive.about]] personal wiki and a commonplace book; notes by me, for me.\n\n🚧 Permanently under construction 🚧\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/zubayr/image/upload/v1658499909/wiki/ajevkuyebljlxiblyst2.png)\n\nThis wiki was made possible with [dendron.so](https://dendron.so) and [obisidian.md](https://obsidian.md). Stored on [Github Repository](https://github.com/zubayrrr/dendron) and hosted on [Netlify](https://netlify.com) for free.\n\n## Principles\n\n### All notes should be relative to me.\n\n- All notes in principle are written for me; what I know about a subject, how I feel about a particular thing.\n- Opinions are fine as long as I feel strong epistemic confidence in the given opinion.\n- Don't over explain a note if it's not necessary, remember, these notes are for you and are relative to whatever knowledge you posses about the subject.\n- Read books and make an dedicated notes for them.\n- Listen podcasts but capture them inside a \"subject specific\" note or \"Map of Concept\" note or a note tagged #areas. Because making notes from podcasts can be tedious as they're not as well structured as books for consumption.(Whose merit is debatable.)\n- #areas are basically \"Map of Concept\" notes but I have recently come to the realization that its better to maintain them [Nikita Voloboev style](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/) but with heavy usage of transclusion and backlinking.\n  - \"Resources\" should be first processed and then mentioned inside the note, otherwise they should be left in inbox.\n\n### Gotta capture 'em all\n\n- Hog whatever information tickles your pickle([anything that gratifies one's intellectual curiosity](https://news.ycombinator.com/newsguidelines.html)).\n- [[swipes]] are interesting/useful bits of... [[quotes|swipes.quotes]], [[excerpts|swipes.excerpts]], [[sayings|swipes.sayings]], [[phrases|swipes.phrases]]. Essentially, ideas, opinions that are swiped off from [[others|resources.people]].\n- Make no distinction between \"your\" ideas and ideas of \"others\", because if you vibe with an idea; it's already yours.\n- But also remember \"If you've time to consume, you've time to produce.\".\n- Use [raindrop.io](https://raindrop.io) to manage your URL bookmarks.\n- If you need to bookmark a webpage or an article all together, use [MarkDownload](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/markdownload-markdown-web/pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi?hl=en-GB) to rip the entire page. Let's call it a [[webmark|inbox.webmark]]; it belong in the `/inbox`.\n- Similar process is employed for capturing tweets using [tweet-to-markdown](https://github.com/kbravh/tweet-to-markdown) and it also belongs in the `/inbox`.\n\n### Don't force evolution\n\n- Let your second brain evolve at it's own pace.\n- The structure should never be _too_ rigid because its meant to take form by itself.\n\n### Noise & Signal\n\n- While capturing ideas left and right is recommended, make sure you're not harming your periods of focus.\n- Have impenetrable focus periods (use Pomodoro method) where you only care about the work on hand and nothing else.\n\n### Why do any of this?\n\n- Because I can't remember everything - there's a lot of information around that interests me and there isn't enough working memory installed in me.\n- So, I make notes - to remember, to create, to meditate, to think.\n- A bodybuilder's portfolio is their body - my portfolio is my wiki.\n- Not only am I making - whatever I know - tangible by writing it down. I know exactly where to look if I ever forget something.\n- I am at the beginning of my learning adventures. When I look back at it, I will know where I came from and how my thoughts evolved over time.\n- Plus, its really fun to nerd out.\n\n## Structure of this wiki\n\n- [[slipbox.Ontology]] explains the structure of this wiki and the tags, backlinks used in it.\n- Dendron takes care of the structure and hierarchy(mostly), but I insist on using tags for backwards compatibility.\n\n## Quicklinks\n\n- [[About me|archive.about]]\n- [Github](https://github.com/zubayrrr)\n- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/zoobhalu)\n- [Blog](https://zubayrali.in)\n- [Guestbook](https://www.yourworldoftext.com/~zubayrali/)\n"},"collectionChildren":null,"customHeadContent":null,"config":{"version":5,"dev":{"enablePreviewV2":true,"enableSelfContainedVaults":true},"commands":{"lookup":{"note":{"selectionMode":"extract","confirmVaultOnCreate":true,"vaultSelectionModeOnCreate":"smart","leaveTrace":false,"bubbleUpCreateNew":true,"fuzzThreshold":0.2}},"randomNote":{},"insertNoteLink":{"aliasMode":"none","enableMultiSelect":false},"insertNoteIndex":{"enableMarker":false},"copyNoteLink":{},"templateHierarchy":"template","insertNote":{"initialValue":"templates"}},"workspace":{"vaults":[{"fsPath":".","selfContained":true,"name":"Dendron"}],"journal":{"dailyDomain":"daily","name":"journal","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd","addBehavior":"childOfDomain"},"scratch":{"name":"scratch","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd.HHmmss","addBehavior":"asOwnDomain"},"task":{"name":"task","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd","addBehavior":"asOwnDomain","statusSymbols":{"":" ","wip":"w","done":"x","assigned":"a","moved":"m","blocked":"b","delegated":"l","dropped":"d","pending":"y"},"taskCompleteStatus":["done","x"],"prioritySymbols":{"H":"high","M":"medium","L":"low"},"todoIntegration":false,"createTaskSelectionType":"selection2link"},"graph":{"zoomSpeed":1,"createStub":false},"enableAutoCreateOnDefinition":false,"enableHandlebarTemplates":true,"enableXVaultWikiLink":false,"enableRemoteVaultInit":true,"enableUserTags":true,"enableHashTags":true,"workspaceVaultSyncMode":"noCommit","enableAutoFoldFrontmatter":false,"enableEditorDecorations":true,"maxPreviewsCached":10,"maxNoteLength":204800,"enableFullHierarchyNoteTitle":false,"enableSmartRefs":true},"preview":{"enableFMTitle":true,"enableNoteTitleForLink":true,"enableFrontmatterTags":true,"enableHashesForFMTags":false,"enableMermaid":true,"enablePrettyRefs":true,"enableKatex":true,"automaticallyShowPreview":false},"publishing":{"theme":"dark","enableFMTitle":true,"enableNoteTitleForLink":true,"enableMermaid":true,"enablePrettyRefs":true,"enableKatex":true,"copyAssets":true,"siteHierarchies":["root"],"writeStubs":false,"siteRootDir":"docs","seo":{"title":"Noetic Noggin","description":"Personal Wiki / Digital Garden","author":"Zubayr Ali","twitter":"zoobhalu"},"github":{"enableEditLink":false,"editLinkText":"Edit this page on GitHub","editBranch":"main","editViewMode":"tree"},"enableSiteLastModified":true,"enableFrontmatterTags":true,"enableHashesForFMTags":false,"enableRandomlyColoredTags":true,"enableTaskNotes":true,"enablePrettyLinks":true,"siteUrl":"localhost:3000","siteFaviconPath":"favicon.ico","siteIndex":"root"}}},"__N_SSG":true}
