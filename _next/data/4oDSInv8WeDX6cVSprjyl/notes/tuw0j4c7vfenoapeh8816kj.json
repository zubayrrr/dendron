Alternative terms for this are computer name and site name. The hostname is used to distinguish devices within a local network. In addition, computers can be found by others through the hostname, which enables data exchange within a network, for example. Hostnames are used on the internet as part of the fully qualified domain name.</p>\n<p>Differentiation between hostname, domain and fully qualified domain name</p>\n<p>The hostname is a freely selectable name for a host. For example, you could call a server in a company network responsible for the central administration of emails “mail” or “mail123”.</p>\n<p>However, if a computer needs to be available over the internet as well as locally, the hostname needs to be supplemented by information that indicates what part of the internet the computer is located in. In the internet, computers can be uniquely assigned using a combination of hostname and domain. These uniquely identifiable name chains are known as a “Fully Qualified Domain Name“ (FQDN). An example of an FQDN would be:</p>\n<p>mail123.example.com.</p>\n<p>If you read the terms of the hierarchy from right to left, you can recognize the components of the FQDN in the following order: root label (empty), top level domain (.com), second level domain (example) and hostname (mail123).</p>\n<p>An FQDN is a human-readable form of addressing. Unlike humans, computers work with numerical IP addresses to uniquely identify computers on the internet. Within the framework of a website visit, an intermediate step is necessary so that the alphanumeric domain can be translated into a numeric IP address.</p>\n<p>The domain name system (DNS) is responsible for this name resolution. The entered domain is assigned to the corresponding IP address and then the searched-for page is called up. The purpose of this system is so that humans do not have to enter the IP address every time they visit a website, but can use a name that will be easier to remember instead.</p>\n<p>Do not confuse the hostname with a subdomain. This is also located to the left of the top-level domain, but does not designate a computer or server, just the domain area. The hostname is still far on the left. Example: In the FQDN <a href=\"http://www.example.ionos.com\">www.example.ionos.com</a>, “IONOS” denotes a domain name, “example” denotes a subdomain and www is the hostname.</p>\n<p>— via <a href=\"https://www.ionos.com/digitalguide/hosting/technical-matters/hostname/\">What is a Hostname? Meaning, Example &#x26; how to check - IONOS</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"hostname-vs-subdomain\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading\" href=\"#hostname-vs-subdomain\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\"><use xlink:href=\"#svg-link\"></use></svg></a>Hostname vs Subdomain</h2>\n<p>Basically, \"domain\" and \"subdomain\" are the same entities, except that the \"sub\" prefix indicates a relationship between two domains. So you can basically talk of a \"subdomain\" only in relationship to another domain. For example <code>google.com</code> and <code>corp.google.com</code> both are domains, but <code>corp.google.com</code> is a subdomain of <code>google.com</code>. <code>google.com</code> itself is also a subdomain, a subdomain of top level domain (TLD) <code>com</code>.</p>\n<p>TLDs are the only domains that you can't talk of as \"subdomains\", because they don't have any higher-level domain above them.</p>\n<p>It's similar to how a file system on a computer is organized: <code>/usr</code> and <code>/usr/bin</code> are both folders, but <code>/usr/bin</code> is a subfolder of <code>/usr</code>. <code>/usr</code> is a subfolder of the root folder (<code>/</code>). The root folder is the only folder that isn't a subfolder of anything.</p>\n<p>Technically, any domain should have one or more <strong>NS records</strong> in the DNS, specifying the name server(s) serving that domain. It is possible to define a domain without it's own NS record, but this is considered trickery. One shouldn't set up DNS like that.</p>\n<p>Hostname - as said in the other answer - is just an individual name assigned to a computer. If you combine hostname with domain, you get a Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN), that identifies a particular computer in the DNS. Any FQDN should translate to an <strong>A record</strong> in the DNS, specifying the IP address assigned to that FQDN (or AAAA record in case of IPv6 addresses).</p>\n<p>One computer can have multiple hostnames and/or multiple FQDNs (even in different domains) which may be assigned either to the same IP address or to different IP addresses - this is fully flexible.</p>\n<p>For example, <code>ns1.google.com</code> is a FQDN of one of the Google's name servers. <code>ns1</code> is a hostname here (we sometimes call it a <strong>hostname part of the FQDN</strong>), and <code>google.com</code> is a domain (similarly, a <strong>domain part of the FQDN</strong>).</p>\n<p>Note that the domain name itself may also be considered a FQDN, especially when the domain itself is also assigned an A record, as it is common nowadays (see below).</p>\n<p><code>www</code> is just a specific hostname that is customarily used to identify the main web server for the given domain. So <code>www.google.com</code> is FQDN of Google's main web server. It is common nowadays to configure DNS so that the domain itself also has A record that refers to the same IP address that the <code>www</code> hostname, so typing for example <code>https://google.com</code> and <code>https://www.google.com</code> brings you to the same website.</p>\n<p>Of course hostnames/FQDNs are not used only for webservers; any computer in the network can have a hostname/FQDN. For example, Gmail's incoming and outgoing mail servers have FQDNS <code>imap.gmail.com</code> and <code>smtp.gmail.com</code>. You don't type these FQDNs into the web browser, because there's no web service on these machines; but you use them eg. when configuring your mail client to use Gmail.</p>\n<p>— via <a href=\"https://superuser.com/questions/1644463/difference-between-subdomain-hostname-host-and-www-in-a-dns-system\">Difference between Subdomain, hostname, host and www in a DNS system? - Super User</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"resources\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading\" href=\"#resources\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\"><use xlink:href=\"#svg-link\"></use></svg></a>Resources</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Fq-hsGYS-8\">Why Do Some Websites Start With WWW1?

Welcome to Noetic Noggin\n\nThis is [[my|archive.about]] personal wiki and a commonplace book; notes by me, for me.\n\n🚧 Permanently under construction 🚧\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/zubayr/image/upload/v1658499909/wiki/ajevkuyebljlxiblyst2.png)\n\nThis wiki was made possible with [dendron.so](https://dendron.so) and [obisidian.md](https://obsidian.md). Stored on [Github Repository](https://github.com/zubayrrr/dendron) and hosted on [Netlify](https://netlify.com) for free.\n\n## Principles\n\n### All notes should be relative to me.\n\n- All notes in principle are written for me; what I know about a subject, how I feel about a particular thing.\n- Opinions are fine as long as I feel strong epistemic confidence in the given opinion.\n- Don't over explain a note if it's not necessary, remember, these notes are for you and are relative to whatever knowledge you posses about the subject.\n- Read books and make an dedicated notes for them.\n- Listen podcasts but capture them inside a \"subject specific\" note or \"Map of Concept\" note or a note tagged #areas. Because making notes from podcasts can be tedious as they're not as well structured as books for consumption.(Whose merit is debatable.)\n- #areas are basically \"Map of Concept\" notes but I have recently come to the realization that its better to maintain them [Nikita Voloboev style](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/) but with heavy usage of transclusion and backlinking.\n  - \"Resources\" should be first processed and then mentioned inside the note, otherwise they should be left in inbox.\n\n### Gotta capture 'em all\n\n- Hog whatever information tickles your pickle([anything that gratifies one's intellectual curiosity](https://news.ycombinator.com/newsguidelines.html)).\n- [[swipes]] are interesting/useful bits of... [[quotes|swipes.quotes]], [[excerpts|swipes.excerpts]], [[sayings|swipes.sayings]], [[phrases|swipes.phrases]]. Essentially, ideas, opinions that are swiped off from [[others|resources.people]].\n- Make no distinction between \"your\" ideas and ideas of \"others\", because if you vibe with an idea; it's already yours.\n- But also remember \"If you've time to consume, you've time to produce.\".\n- Use [raindrop.io](https://raindrop.io) to manage your URL bookmarks.\n- If you need to bookmark a webpage or an article all together, use [MarkDownload](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/markdownload-markdown-web/pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi?hl=en-GB) to rip the entire page. Let's call it a [[webmark|inbox.webmark]]; it belong in the `/inbox`.\n- Similar process is employed for capturing tweets using [tweet-to-markdown](https://github.com/kbravh/tweet-to-markdown) and it also belongs in the `/inbox`.\n\n### Don't force evolution\n\n- Let your second brain evolve at it's own pace.\n- The structure should never be _too_ rigid because its meant to take form by itself.\n\n### Noise & Signal\n\n- While capturing ideas left and right is recommended, make sure you're not harming your periods of focus.\n- Have impenetrable focus periods (use Pomodoro method) where you only care about the work on hand and nothing else.\n\n### Why do any of this?\n\n- Because I can't remember everything - there's a lot of information around that interests me and there isn't enough working memory installed in me.\n- So, I make notes - to remember, to create, to meditate, to think.\n- A bodybuilder's portfolio is their body - my portfolio is my wiki.\n- Not only am I making - whatever I know - tangible by writing it down. I know exactly where to look if I ever forget something.\n- I am at the beginning of my learning adventures. When I look back at it, I will know where I came from and how my thoughts evolved over time.\n- Plus, its really fun to nerd out.\n\n## Structure of this wiki\n\n- [[slipbox.Ontology]] explains the structure of this wiki and the tags, backlinks used in it.\n- Dendron takes care of the structure and hierarchy(mostly), but I insist on using tags for backwards compatibility.\n\n## Quicklinks\n\n- [[About me|archive.about]]\n- [Github](https://github.com/zubayrrr)\n- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/zoobhalu)\n- [Blog](https://zubayrali.in)\n- [Guestbook](https://www.yourworldoftext.com/~zubayrali/)\n"},"collectionChildren":null,"customHeadContent":null,"config":{"version":5,"dev":{"enablePreviewV2":true,"enableSelfContainedVaults":true},"commands":{"lookup":{"note":{"selectionMode":"extract","confirmVaultOnCreate":true,"vaultSelectionModeOnCreate":"smart","leaveTrace":false,"bubbleUpCreateNew":true,"fuzzThreshold":0.2}},"randomNote":{},"insertNoteLink":{"aliasMode":"none","enableMultiSelect":false},"insertNoteIndex":{"enableMarker":false},"copyNoteLink":{},"templateHierarchy":"template","insertNote":{"initialValue":"templates"}},"workspace":{"vaults":[{"fsPath":".","selfContained":true,"name":"Dendron"}],"journal":{"dailyDomain":"daily","name":"journal","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd","addBehavior":"childOfDomain"},"scratch":{"name":"scratch","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd.HHmmss","addBehavior":"asOwnDomain"},"task":{"name":"task","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd","addBehavior":"asOwnDomain","statusSymbols":{"":" ","wip":"w","done":"x","assigned":"a","moved":"m","blocked":"b","delegated":"l","dropped":"d","pending":"y"},"taskCompleteStatus":["done","x"],"prioritySymbols":{"H":"high","M":"medium","L":"low"},"todoIntegration":false,"createTaskSelectionType":"selection2link"},"graph":{"zoomSpeed":1,"createStub":false},"enableAutoCreateOnDefinition":false,"enableHandlebarTemplates":true,"enableXVaultWikiLink":false,"enableRemoteVaultInit":true,"enableUserTags":true,"enableHashTags":true,"workspaceVaultSyncMode":"noCommit","enableAutoFoldFrontmatter":false,"enableEditorDecorations":true,"maxPreviewsCached":10,"maxNoteLength":204800,"enableFullHierarchyNoteTitle":false,"enableSmartRefs":true},"preview":{"enableFMTitle":true,"enableNoteTitleForLink":true,"enableFrontmatterTags":true,"enableHashesForFMTags":false,"enableMermaid":true,"enablePrettyRefs":true,"enableKatex":true,"automaticallyShowPreview":false},"publishing":{"theme":"dark","enableFMTitle":true,"enableNoteTitleForLink":true,"enableMermaid":true,"enablePrettyRefs":true,"enableKatex":true,"copyAssets":true,"siteHierarchies":["root"],"writeStubs":false,"siteRootDir":"docs","seo":{"title":"Noetic Noggin","description":"Personal Wiki / Digital Garden","author":"Zubayr Ali","twitter":"zoobhalu"},"github":{"enableEditLink":false,"editLinkText":"Edit this page on GitHub","editBranch":"main","editViewMode":"tree"},"enableSiteLastModified":true,"enableFrontmatterTags":true,"enableHashesForFMTags":false,"enableRandomlyColoredTags":true,"enableTaskNotes":true,"enablePrettyLinks":true,"siteUrl":"localhost:3000","siteFaviconPath":"favicon.ico","siteIndex":"root"}}},"__N_SSG":true}
