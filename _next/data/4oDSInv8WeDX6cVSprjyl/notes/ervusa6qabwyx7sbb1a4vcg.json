Service</p>\n<p>It is an alternative to <a href=\"/notes/y43l1e8ej1au0hfrdkqmdh7\">AWS ECS</a>.</p>\n<p>EKS is a service that provides and manages a <a href=\"/notes/gbeh61d6hvbmxxy63chp81b\">Kubernetes</a> control plane on its own. You have no access to the master nodes on EKS since they’re under a special AWS account.</p>\n<p>To run a Kubernetes workload, EKS establishes the control plane and Kubernetes API in your managed AWS infrastructure and you’re good to go.</p>\n<p>At this point, you can deploy workloads using native K8s tools like kubectl, Kubernetes Dashboard, Helm, and Terraform.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You <strong>don’t have to install, operate, and maintain</strong> your Kubernetes control plane.</li>\n<li>EKS allows you to <strong>easily run tooling and plugins</strong> developed by the Kubernetes open-source community.</li>\n<li>EKS <strong>automates load distribution and parallel processing</strong> better than any DevOps engineer could.</li>\n<li>Your Kubernetes assets integrate seamlessly with AWS services if you use EKS.</li>\n<li>EKS uses VPC networking.</li>\n<li>Any application running on EKS is compatible with one running in your existing Kubernetes environment. You can migrate to EKS without applying any changes to the code.</li>\n<li>Supports <strong>EC2 spot instances</strong> using managed node groups that follow spot best practices and allow some pretty great cost savings.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"managing-a-kubernetes-cluster\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading\" href=\"#managing-a-kubernetes-cluster\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\"><use xlink:href=\"#svg-link\"></use></svg></a>Managing a Kubernetes cluster</h2>\n<p>Setting up a cluster in EKS is relatively complicated and comes with some prerequisites. You need to set up and use the AWS CLI and aws-iam-authenticator, and set up IAM permissions and users which adds to your workload.</p>\n<p>EKS doesn’t create worker nodes automatically, so you’re also in charge of managing that process. You also need to make extra effort to set up EKS with CloudFormation or Terraform.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>EKS comes with a <strong>well-defined way of upgrading the control plane with minimized disruption</strong>. You can then update worker nodes using the newer Kubernetes AMI, create a new worker group, and finally migrate your workload to the new nodes.</li>\n<li><strong>Scaling up the cluster is simple</strong> and based on adding more worker nodes. The control plane is fully managed, so there’s no need to worry about adding or upgrading master node sizes when your cluster grows.</li>\n<li><strong>Carrying out the most common maintenance tasks</strong> is easy in EKS – you can add worker nodes, replace them, terminate instances, and upgrade your setup with minimal disruption to your cluster.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Via - <a href=\"https://cast.ai/blog/aws-eks-vs-ecs-vs-fargate-where-to-manage-your-kubernetes/\">AWS EKS vs. ECS vs. Fargate vs. Kops: Where to Manage Your Kubernetes in 2022? - CAST AI – Kubernetes Automation Platform</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"how-does-eks-work\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading\" href=\"#how-does-eks-work\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\"><use xlink:href=\"#svg-link\"></use></svg></a>How does EKS work?</h2>\n<p>You create a EKS cluster which represents a control plane. These will be master nodes.</p>\n<p>When you create an EKS service/cluster AWS will provision Kubernetes master nodes that already have Kubernetes master services installed on them.</p>\n<p>Since they're managed by AWS EKS, it'll automatically replicate the master nodes across multiple Availability Zones.</p>\n<p>Etcd is part of the master nodes which store the whole configuration/the current state of Kubernetes cluster. This storage is also replicated/backed up by AWS.</p>\n<p>For Worker Nodes:</p>\n<p>You'll create <a href=\"/notes/1h5mmmv2b68di6siwa31jvh\">AWS EC2</a> instances, so called \"Compute Fleet\" of multiple virtual servers and connect them to EKS.</p>\n<p>Worker nodes have Kubernetes process running on it so the Kubernetes master node can communicate with them.</p>\n<p>In this case also, you need to manage the EC2 instance for your worker nodes, yourself.</p>\n<p>You have the option of \"semi-managed\" EC2 instances for your cluster. EKS with Nodegroup. The Nodegroup will handle some of the heavy lifting for you. Basically make it easier for you to configure new worker nodes for your cluster.\nFor example: Worker nodes managed by nodegroup will get all the processes necessary installed on them(like container runtime, K8s processes) transform them into Worker Nodes.</p>\n<p>It is a good practice to use Nodegroups.</p>\n<p>You still need to configure things like <a href=\"/notes/gobjqdyrbtfatze61u0l31z\">AutoScaling Group</a>. Even this can be delegated to AWS you can again combine <a href=\"/notes/8io7ikmud38hlpv4vqm3f7r\">AWS Fargate</a> for your EKS cluster.</p>\n<p>Fully managed worker nodes with Fargate and Fully managed control plane(master nodes) with EKS.</p>\n<p>You can also use EC2 and Fargate in the same EKS cluster.</p>\n<h2 id=\"setting-up-eks-cluster\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading\" href=\"#setting-up-eks-cluster\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\"><use xlink:href=\"#svg-link\"></use></svg></a>Setting up EKS Cluster</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Master nodes\n<ul>\n<li>Provision an EKS cluster</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Worker nodes\n<ul>\n<li>Create Nodegroup of EC2 instances(compute fleet)</li>\n<li>OR you can use Fargate</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Connect Nodegroup with EKS cluster</li>\n<li>Connect to cluster using <code>kubectl</code>\n<ul>\n<li>Deploy your containerized applications</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"creating-eks-cluster-via-management-console\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading\" href=\"#creating-eks-cluster-via-management-console\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\"><use xlink:href=\"#svg-link\"></use></svg></a>Creating EKS Cluster via Management Console</h2>\n<p><strong>Overview/steps</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Create <a href=\"/notes/uu932tw90r0gvvg8maqr3s1\">AWS IAM</a> Role for EKS service</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Role is created so the EKS service(attached) has the permissions/policies to create things in AWS account.

Welcome to Noetic Noggin\n\nThis is [[my|archive.about]] personal wiki and a commonplace book; notes by me, for me.\n\n🚧 Permanently under construction 🚧\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/zubayr/image/upload/v1658499909/wiki/ajevkuyebljlxiblyst2.png)\n\nThis wiki was made possible with [dendron.so](https://dendron.so) and [obisidian.md](https://obsidian.md). Stored on [Github Repository](https://github.com/zubayrrr/dendron) and hosted on [Netlify](https://netlify.com) for free.\n\n## Principles\n\n### All notes should be relative to me.\n\n- All notes in principle are written for me; what I know about a subject, how I feel about a particular thing.\n- Opinions are fine as long as I feel strong epistemic confidence in the given opinion.\n- Don't over explain a note if it's not necessary, remember, these notes are for you and are relative to whatever knowledge you posses about the subject.\n- Read books and make an dedicated notes for them.\n- Listen podcasts but capture them inside a \"subject specific\" note or \"Map of Concept\" note or a note tagged #areas. Because making notes from podcasts can be tedious as they're not as well structured as books for consumption.(Whose merit is debatable.)\n- #areas are basically \"Map of Concept\" notes but I have recently come to the realization that its better to maintain them [Nikita Voloboev style](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/) but with heavy usage of transclusion and backlinking.\n  - \"Resources\" should be first processed and then mentioned inside the note, otherwise they should be left in inbox.\n\n### Gotta capture 'em all\n\n- Hog whatever information tickles your pickle([anything that gratifies one's intellectual curiosity](https://news.ycombinator.com/newsguidelines.html)).\n- [[swipes]] are interesting/useful bits of... [[quotes|swipes.quotes]], [[excerpts|swipes.excerpts]], [[sayings|swipes.sayings]], [[phrases|swipes.phrases]]. Essentially, ideas, opinions that are swiped off from [[others|resources.people]].\n- Make no distinction between \"your\" ideas and ideas of \"others\", because if you vibe with an idea; it's already yours.\n- But also remember \"If you've time to consume, you've time to produce.\".\n- Use [raindrop.io](https://raindrop.io) to manage your URL bookmarks.\n- If you need to bookmark a webpage or an article all together, use [MarkDownload](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/markdownload-markdown-web/pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi?hl=en-GB) to rip the entire page. Let's call it a [[webmark|inbox.webmark]]; it belong in the `/inbox`.\n- Similar process is employed for capturing tweets using [tweet-to-markdown](https://github.com/kbravh/tweet-to-markdown) and it also belongs in the `/inbox`.\n\n### Don't force evolution\n\n- Let your second brain evolve at it's own pace.\n- The structure should never be _too_ rigid because its meant to take form by itself.\n\n### Noise & Signal\n\n- While capturing ideas left and right is recommended, make sure you're not harming your periods of focus.\n- Have impenetrable focus periods (use Pomodoro method) where you only care about the work on hand and nothing else.\n\n### Why do any of this?\n\n- Because I can't remember everything - there's a lot of information around that interests me and there isn't enough working memory installed in me.\n- So, I make notes - to remember, to create, to meditate, to think.\n- A bodybuilder's portfolio is their body - my portfolio is my wiki.\n- Not only am I making - whatever I know - tangible by writing it down. I know exactly where to look if I ever forget something.\n- I am at the beginning of my learning adventures. When I look back at it, I will know where I came from and how my thoughts evolved over time.\n- Plus, its really fun to nerd out.\n\n## Structure of this wiki\n\n- [[slipbox.Ontology]] explains the structure of this wiki and the tags, backlinks used in it.\n- Dendron takes care of the structure and hierarchy(mostly), but I insist on using tags for backwards compatibility.\n\n## Quicklinks\n\n- [[About me|archive.about]]\n- [Github](https://github.com/zubayrrr)\n- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/zoobhalu)\n- [Blog](https://zubayrali.in)\n- [Guestbook](https://www.yourworldoftext.com/~zubayrali/)\n"},"collectionChildren":null,"customHeadContent":null,"config":{"version":5,"dev":{"enablePreviewV2":true,"enableSelfContainedVaults":true},"commands":{"lookup":{"note":{"selectionMode":"extract","confirmVaultOnCreate":true,"vaultSelectionModeOnCreate":"smart","leaveTrace":false,"bubbleUpCreateNew":true,"fuzzThreshold":0.2}},"randomNote":{},"insertNoteLink":{"aliasMode":"none","enableMultiSelect":false},"insertNoteIndex":{"enableMarker":false},"copyNoteLink":{},"templateHierarchy":"template","insertNote":{"initialValue":"templates"}},"workspace":{"vaults":[{"fsPath":".","selfContained":true,"name":"Dendron"}],"journal":{"dailyDomain":"daily","name":"journal","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd","addBehavior":"childOfDomain"},"scratch":{"name":"scratch","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd.HHmmss","addBehavior":"asOwnDomain"},"task":{"name":"task","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd","addBehavior":"asOwnDomain","statusSymbols":{"":" ","wip":"w","done":"x","assigned":"a","moved":"m","blocked":"b","delegated":"l","dropped":"d","pending":"y"},"taskCompleteStatus":["done","x"],"prioritySymbols":{"H":"high","M":"medium","L":"low"},"todoIntegration":false,"createTaskSelectionType":"selection2link"},"graph":{"zoomSpeed":1,"createStub":false},"enableAutoCreateOnDefinition":false,"enableHandlebarTemplates":true,"enableXVaultWikiLink":false,"enableRemoteVaultInit":true,"enableUserTags":true,"enableHashTags":true,"workspaceVaultSyncMode":"noCommit","enableAutoFoldFrontmatter":false,"enableEditorDecorations":true,"maxPreviewsCached":10,"maxNoteLength":204800,"enableFullHierarchyNoteTitle":false,"enableSmartRefs":true},"preview":{"enableFMTitle":true,"enableNoteTitleForLink":true,"enableFrontmatterTags":true,"enableHashesForFMTags":false,"enableMermaid":true,"enablePrettyRefs":true,"enableKatex":true,"automaticallyShowPreview":false},"publishing":{"theme":"dark","enableFMTitle":true,"enableNoteTitleForLink":true,"enableMermaid":true,"enablePrettyRefs":true,"enableKatex":true,"copyAssets":true,"siteHierarchies":["root"],"writeStubs":false,"siteRootDir":"docs","seo":{"title":"Noetic Noggin","description":"Personal Wiki / Digital Garden","author":"Zubayr Ali","twitter":"zoobhalu"},"github":{"enableEditLink":false,"editLinkText":"Edit this page on GitHub","editBranch":"main","editViewMode":"tree"},"enableSiteLastModified":true,"enableFrontmatterTags":true,"enableHashesForFMTags":false,"enableRandomlyColoredTags":true,"enableTaskNotes":true,"enablePrettyLinks":true,"siteUrl":"localhost:3000","siteFaviconPath":"favicon.ico","siteIndex":"root"}}},"__N_SSG":true}
