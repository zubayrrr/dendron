There are a number of subjects that need to be covered in order to ensure you are ready for back-to-back questions.</p>\n<p>Some positions require <a href=\"https://hadoop.apache.org/\">Hadoop</a>, others <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL\">SQL</a>. Some roles require understanding statistics, while still others require heavy amounts of system design.</p>\n<p>We have gathered many of the resources that we have used to study and get jobs at companies in the FAANG family as well as other major tech companies. We have yet to find one that requires you to know anything about Hadoop during the interview, so that has not been included in this study guide.</p>\n<p>We recommend asking the recruiter if you aren’t sure which type of interview you will be facing. Some companies are very good at keeping interviews consistent, but even then, teams can deviate depending on what they are looking for. Here are some examples of what we have noticed about some companies' data engineering interviews.</p>\n<p><strong>Amazon —</strong> SQL- and database-design heavy as well as general ETL design. Surprisingly, no Python.</p>\n<p><strong>Netflix —</strong>SQL- and code-heavy, with the expectation that you can not only write SQL and code but can optimize them.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>“They asked about SQL queries to find time difference between two events given certain condition. ” — Netflix data engineer on Glassdoor</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Expedia</strong> — Big Data questions, like what is Spark and RDDs, as well as SQL and Python.</p>\n<p>Due to this variance, we’ve created a checklist to keep track of what subject areas you have already studied and what you still need to cover: <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GOO4s1NcxCR8a44F0XnsErz5rYDxNbHAHznu4pJMRkw/edit#gid=0\">data engineering study checklist</a>.</p>\n<p>Also, I recently created a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lloOlnSzSs&#x26;t=1s\">video guide</a> to walk through the data engineering interview study guide.</p>\n<p>Let’s get started with SQL.</p>\n<h1 id=\"sql\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading\" href=\"#sql\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\"><use xlink:href=\"#svg-link\"></use></svg></a>SQL</h1>\n<p>As a data engineer, it is almost inevitable that you will get some SQL questions. As someone who has participated in many interviews for a lot of top tech companies, like Amazon and Capital One, I know that they usually follow some similar patterns.</p>\n<p>Typically there will be at least one question that requires an aggregation with a filter, another that requires a few joins, and then one that requires a subquery. Along with that, there might be a few curveball questions that require self-joins, recursions, and analytic functions. So let’s look at a couple of concepts that are good to cover.</p>\n<h2 id=\"pre-video-sql-problems\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading\" href=\"#pre-video-sql-problems\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\"><use xlink:href=\"#svg-link\"></use></svg></a>Pre-video SQL problems</h2>\n<p>These first few problems will help you gauge where you are on different concepts. That way you can take notes on the study guide, and go back and review what you feel you were not comfortable with.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"https://leetcode.com/problems/trips-and-users/\">262.

In addition, we have listed a few plausible database/DW concepts you could attempt to design out on your own.</p>\n<p>We recommend going through the videos and at least skimming the Data Warehouse Toolkit before attempting the self-practice problems.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.kimballgroup.com/data-warehouse-business-intelligence-resources/books/data-warehouse-dw-toolkit/\">The Data Warehouse Toolkit</a>  by Ralph Kimball</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_rxqSJAj6U\">Designing a Traditional Relational Database Video</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--OJpdPeH80\">Data Warehouse Design Video</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"self-practice-problems\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading\" href=\"#self-practice-problems\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\"><use xlink:href=\"#svg-link\"></use></svg></a>Self-practice problems</h2>\n<p>For this part of your interview practice, we are going to list a few business systems that you can try to design out. First, we recommend designing a relational database, then thinking about how you would design an ETL and DW that rely on that relational DB.</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> In addition, we have found it very common that interviewers will base their interview questions on your design. So think about some of the questions you could answer with your DB and list them.</p>\n<p>Design a database/ETL and DW for a:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>dating app</li>\n<li>bicycle rental service</li>\n<li>music streaming app</li>\n<li>job search website</li>\n<li>Udemy-like website</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These are just a few ideas. We hope they help you have a clearer idea of what you can practice modeling and designing. Take some time to think about how users interact with these websites before getting started.</p>\n<h1 id=\"programming-problems\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading\" href=\"#programming-problems\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\"><use xlink:href=\"#svg-link\"></use></svg></a>Programming Problems</h1>\n<p>Data engineers do a significant amount of programming in their daily life. There are several specific languages data engineers use. Python is arguably the most common.</p>\n<p>If the role requires a lot of Hadoop work, then <a href=\"https://www.java.com/en/\">Java</a> is also a useful language to have. There are a few other useful languages, like Java and <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/overview?view=powershell-7.1\">PowerShell</a> (if you work at a Microsoft shop).</p>\n<p>There are two types of questions we have experienced. Some interviewers will ask you more operational questions. Others will ask classic algorithm and data structure questions.</p>\n<h1 id=\"operational-programming-problems\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading\" href=\"#operational-programming-problems\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\"><use xlink:href=\"#svg-link\"></use></svg></a>Operational Programming Problems</h1>\n<p>Operational interview questions are harder to prep for. There are no “classic” interview questions here. However, they are also often easier to figure out on the spot. Algorithm interview questions usually have some sort of trick. Like the balanced brackets problem: If you don’t know you need to use queues, it will be very difficult to get to the correct answer.</p>\n<p>Operational problems, however, will be more focused on workflows and business processes. So as long as you are good at walking through real problems, this should be easier. Here are some problems that are great for prepping. We find it is helpful to know how to use arrays and dictionaries. Beyond that, there isn’t too much more required.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/kangaroo/problem\">Kangaroo problem</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/breaking-best-and-worst-records/problem\">Breaking records</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/find-a-string/problem\">Find a string</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/itertools-permutations/problem\">itertools.permutations()</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/no-idea/problem\">No idea!</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/day-of-the-programmer/problem\">Days of the programmer</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/climbing-the-leaderboard/problem\">Leaderboard</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/word-order/problem\">Word order</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/sherlock-and-squares/problem\">Sherlock and squares</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/equality-in-a-array/problem\">Equalize the array</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/apple-and-orange/problem\">Apples and oranges</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/python\">More operational style questions</a></li>\n</ol>\n<h1 id=\"algorithms-and-data-structures\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading\" href=\"#algorithms-and-data-structures\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\"><use xlink:href=\"#svg-link\"></use></svg></a>Algorithms and Data Structures</h1>\n<p>Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@markusspiske?utm_source=medium&#x26;utm_medium=referral\">Markus Spiske</a> on <a href=\"https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&#x26;utm_medium=referral\">Unsplash</a></p>\n<p>Before going too deep into data structure and algorithms, let’s do a quick check to see how you are currently doing in this area. We have listed eight LeetCode problems that vary in difficulty. Try these out and try to gauge yourself on how long it takes you, as well as how many hints you needed.

Welcome to Noetic Noggin\n\nThis is [[my|archive.about]] personal wiki and a commonplace book; notes by me, for me.\n\n🚧 Permanently under construction 🚧\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/zubayr/image/upload/v1658499909/wiki/ajevkuyebljlxiblyst2.png)\n\nThis wiki was made possible with [dendron.so](https://dendron.so) and [obisidian.md](https://obsidian.md). Stored on [Github Repository](https://github.com/zubayrrr/dendron) and hosted on [Netlify](https://netlify.com) for free.\n\n## Principles\n\n### All notes should be relative to me.\n\n- All notes in principle are written for me; what I know about a subject, how I feel about a particular thing.\n- Opinions are fine as long as I feel strong epistemic confidence in the given opinion.\n- Don't over explain a note if it's not necessary, remember, these notes are for you and are relative to whatever knowledge you posses about the subject.\n- Read books and make an dedicated notes for them.\n- Listen podcasts but capture them inside a \"subject specific\" note or \"Map of Concept\" note or a note tagged #areas. Because making notes from podcasts can be tedious as they're not as well structured as books for consumption.(Whose merit is debatable.)\n- #areas are basically \"Map of Concept\" notes but I have recently come to the realization that its better to maintain them [Nikita Voloboev style](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/) but with heavy usage of transclusion and backlinking.\n  - \"Resources\" should be first processed and then mentioned inside the note, otherwise they should be left in inbox.\n\n### Gotta capture 'em all\n\n- Hog whatever information tickles your pickle([anything that gratifies one's intellectual curiosity](https://news.ycombinator.com/newsguidelines.html)).\n- [[swipes]] are interesting/useful bits of... [[quotes|swipes.quotes]], [[excerpts|swipes.excerpts]], [[sayings|swipes.sayings]], [[phrases|swipes.phrases]]. Essentially, ideas, opinions that are swiped off from [[others|resources.people]].\n- Make no distinction between \"your\" ideas and ideas of \"others\", because if you vibe with an idea; it's already yours.\n- But also remember \"If you've time to consume, you've time to produce.\".\n- Use [raindrop.io](https://raindrop.io) to manage your URL bookmarks.\n- If you need to bookmark a webpage or an article all together, use [MarkDownload](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/markdownload-markdown-web/pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi?hl=en-GB) to rip the entire page. Let's call it a [[webmark|inbox.webmark]]; it belong in the `/inbox`.\n- Similar process is employed for capturing tweets using [tweet-to-markdown](https://github.com/kbravh/tweet-to-markdown) and it also belongs in the `/inbox`.\n\n### Don't force evolution\n\n- Let your second brain evolve at it's own pace.\n- The structure should never be _too_ rigid because its meant to take form by itself.\n\n### Noise & Signal\n\n- While capturing ideas left and right is recommended, make sure you're not harming your periods of focus.\n- Have impenetrable focus periods (use Pomodoro method) where you only care about the work on hand and nothing else.\n\n### Why do any of this?\n\n- Because I can't remember everything - there's a lot of information around that interests me and there isn't enough working memory installed in me.\n- So, I make notes - to remember, to create, to meditate, to think.\n- A bodybuilder's portfolio is their body - my portfolio is my wiki.\n- Not only am I making - whatever I know - tangible by writing it down. I know exactly where to look if I ever forget something.\n- I am at the beginning of my learning adventures. When I look back at it, I will know where I came from and how my thoughts evolved over time.\n- Plus, its really fun to nerd out.\n\n## Structure of this wiki\n\n- [[slipbox.Ontology]] explains the structure of this wiki and the tags, backlinks used in it.\n- Dendron takes care of the structure and hierarchy(mostly), but I insist on using tags for backwards compatibility.\n\n## Quicklinks\n\n- [[About me|archive.about]]\n- [Github](https://github.com/zubayrrr)\n- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/zoobhalu)\n- [Blog](https://zubayrali.in)\n- [Guestbook](https://www.yourworldoftext.com/~zubayrali/)\n"},"collectionChildren":null,"customHeadContent":null,"config":{"version":5,"dev":{"enablePreviewV2":true,"enableSelfContainedVaults":true},"commands":{"lookup":{"note":{"selectionMode":"extract","confirmVaultOnCreate":true,"vaultSelectionModeOnCreate":"smart","leaveTrace":false,"bubbleUpCreateNew":true,"fuzzThreshold":0.2}},"randomNote":{},"insertNoteLink":{"aliasMode":"none","enableMultiSelect":false},"insertNoteIndex":{"enableMarker":false},"copyNoteLink":{},"templateHierarchy":"template","insertNote":{"initialValue":"templates"}},"workspace":{"vaults":[{"fsPath":".","selfContained":true,"name":"Dendron"}],"journal":{"dailyDomain":"daily","name":"journal","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd","addBehavior":"childOfDomain"},"scratch":{"name":"scratch","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd.HHmmss","addBehavior":"asOwnDomain"},"task":{"name":"task","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd","addBehavior":"asOwnDomain","statusSymbols":{"":" ","wip":"w","done":"x","assigned":"a","moved":"m","blocked":"b","delegated":"l","dropped":"d","pending":"y"},"taskCompleteStatus":["done","x"],"prioritySymbols":{"H":"high","M":"medium","L":"low"},"todoIntegration":false,"createTaskSelectionType":"selection2link"},"graph":{"zoomSpeed":1,"createStub":false},"enableAutoCreateOnDefinition":false,"enableHandlebarTemplates":true,"enableXVaultWikiLink":false,"enableRemoteVaultInit":true,"enableUserTags":true,"enableHashTags":true,"workspaceVaultSyncMode":"noCommit","enableAutoFoldFrontmatter":false,"enableEditorDecorations":true,"maxPreviewsCached":10,"maxNoteLength":204800,"enableFullHierarchyNoteTitle":false,"enableSmartRefs":true},"preview":{"enableFMTitle":true,"enableNoteTitleForLink":true,"enableFrontmatterTags":true,"enableHashesForFMTags":false,"enableMermaid":true,"enablePrettyRefs":true,"enableKatex":true,"automaticallyShowPreview":false},"publishing":{"theme":"dark","enableFMTitle":true,"enableNoteTitleForLink":true,"enableMermaid":true,"enablePrettyRefs":true,"enableKatex":true,"copyAssets":true,"siteHierarchies":["root"],"writeStubs":false,"siteRootDir":"docs","seo":{"title":"Noetic Noggin","description":"Personal Wiki / Digital Garden","author":"Zubayr Ali","twitter":"zoobhalu"},"github":{"enableEditLink":false,"editLinkText":"Edit this page on GitHub","editBranch":"main","editViewMode":"tree"},"enableSiteLastModified":true,"enableFrontmatterTags":true,"enableHashesForFMTags":false,"enableRandomlyColoredTags":true,"enableTaskNotes":true,"enablePrettyLinks":true,"siteUrl":"localhost:3000","siteFaviconPath":"favicon.ico","siteIndex":"root"}}},"__N_SSG":true}
