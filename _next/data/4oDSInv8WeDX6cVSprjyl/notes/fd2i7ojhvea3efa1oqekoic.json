Guha\">Sujoy K. Guha</a> developed RISUG after years of developing other inventions. He originally wanted to create an artificial heart that could pump blood using a strong electrical pulse. Using the 13-chamber model of a cockroach heart, he designed a softer pumping mechanism that would theoretically be safe to use in humans.<a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-4\">[4]</a> As India's population grew throughout the 1970s, Guha modified his heart pump design to create a water pump that could work off of differences in ionic charges between salt water and fresh water in water treatment facilities. This filtration system did not require electricity and could potentially help large groups of people have access to clean water. India, however, decided that the population problem would be better served by developing more effective contraception. So Guha again modified his design to work safely inside the body, specifically inside the male genitalia. The non-toxic polymer of RISUG also uses differences in the charges of the <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semen\" title=\"Semen\">semen</a> to rupture the <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sperm\" title=\"Sperm\">sperm</a> as it flows through the <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vas_deferens\" title=\"Vas deferens\">vas deferens</a>.<a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-Wired-2\">[2]</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellectual_property\" title=\"Intellectual property\">Intellectual property</a> rights to RISUG in the United States were acquired between 2010 and 2012 by the <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsemus_Foundation\" title=\"Parsemus Foundation\">Parsemus Foundation</a>, a <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonprofit_organization\" title=\"Nonprofit organization\">not-for-profit organization</a>, which has branded it as \"Vasalgel\".<a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-Beck_2011-06-14-5\">[5]</a><a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-6\">[6]</a> Vasalgel, which has a slightly different formulation than RISUG, underwent <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_testing\" title=\"Animal testing\">animal trials</a> in the United States, but reversibility proved unsuccessful.<a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-Francis-7\">[7]</a> Initially, researchers were optimistic that human trials would commence by the end of 2013 and become available within a few years.<a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-8\">[8]</a> After delays in development, human trials were expected to commence in 2018.<a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-9\">[9]</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"mechanismsedit\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading\" href=\"#mechanismsedit\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\"><use xlink:href=\"#svg-link\"></use></svg></a>Mechanisms<a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Reversible_inhibition_of_sperm_under_guidance&#x26;action=edit&#x26;section=2\" title=\"Edit section: Mechanisms\">Edit</a></h2>\n<p>RISUG works by an injection into the vas deferens, the vessel through which the sperm moves before <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ejaculation\" title=\"Ejaculation\">ejaculation</a>.

In response, Guha argued that substances can be individually toxic in nature but harmless as compounds like pure chlorine, which can melt human flesh on its own, but, when combined with sodium, it becomes sodium chloride – the basic salt that people consume in their diets. When it did not persuade <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Council_of_Medical_Research\" title=\"Indian Council of Medical Research\">ICMR</a> and the clinical trials did not resume by 1996, he went to the Supreme court and the next round of clinical trials resumed afterwards.<a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-TheWire-14\">[14]</a></p>\n<p>In October 2002, <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_health_ministry\" title=\"Indian health ministry\">India's Ministry of Health</a> aborted the clinical trials due to reports of <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_serum_albumin\" title=\"Human serum albumin\">albumin</a> in <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urine\" title=\"Urine\">urine</a>[<em><a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed\" title=\"Wikipedia:Citation needed\">citation needed</a></em>] and scrotal swelling in <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial#Phase_III\" title=\"Clinical trial\">phase III trial</a> participants.

The trials were over, including extended, phase III clinical trials, for which 303 candidates were recruited with 97.3% success rate and no reported side effects.<a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-15\">[15]</a></p>\n<p>In the <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developed_world\" title=\"Developed world\">developed world</a>, the average time taken for a drug to go from concept to market is 10 to 15 years, whereas, it has been over four decades since Guha published his original paper on RISUG.<a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-TheWire-14\">[14]</a> RISUG is an inexpensive, single-use drug which does not require major surgery, thus making it an unprofitable business model for drug companies who work on the principle of continuous demand and long term profit. RISUG aims to provide males with years-long fertility control, thereby overcoming compliance problems and avoiding ongoing costs associated with condoms and the female <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birth_control_pill\" title=\"Birth control pill\">birth control pill</a>, which must be taken daily.<a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-16\">[16]</a></p>\n<p>Pharmaceutical companies have expressed little interest in RISUG.<a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-Khilwani-17\">[17]</a> One obstacle facing marketing of the product is that men generally perceive contraception as a woman's issue. Men may also choose not to use alternative methods of contraception because there are fewer options for birth control for them than there are for women, or they may fear the side effects, or it may conflict with their cultural or religious beliefs.<a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-Khilwani-17\">[17]</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"smart-risugedit\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading\" href=\"#smart-risugedit\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\"><use xlink:href=\"#svg-link\"></use></svg></a>Smart RISUG<a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Reversible_inhibition_of_sperm_under_guidance&#x26;action=edit&#x26;section=5\" title=\"Edit section: Smart RISUG\">Edit</a></h2>\n<p>Smart RISUG is a newer version of the male contraception that was published in 2009. The polymer adds iron oxide and copper particles to the original compound, giving it magnetic properties and the name \"Smart RISUG\". After injection the exact location of the polymer inside the vas deferens can be measured and visualized by <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray\" title=\"X-ray\">X-ray</a> and <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_resonance_imaging\" title=\"Magnetic resonance imaging\">magnetic resonance imaging</a>. The polymer location can also be externally controlled using a pulsed magnetic field. With this magnetic field, the polymer can change location inside the body to maximize sterility or can be removed to restore fertility. The polymer has <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_magnetostrictive_effect\" title=\"Inverse magnetostrictive effect\">magnetoelastic behavior</a> that allows it to stretch and elongate to better line the vas deferens. The iron oxide component is necessary to prevent agglomeration.</p>\n<p>With the presence of iron particles, the polymer has lower protein binding and therefore prevents agglomeration. The copper particles in the compound allow the polymer to conduct heat. When an external microwave applies heat to the polymer, it can liquify the polymer again to be excreted to restore fertility. Smart RISUG is therefore a better choice for men who want to use RISUG as temporary birth control, since it does not require a second surgery to restore fertility. The addition of metal ions also increases the effectiveness of the spermicide. The low frequency electromagnetic field disintegrates the sperm cell membrane in the head region. This in turn causes both <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acrosin\" title=\"Acrosin\">acrosin</a> and <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyaluronidase\" title=\"Hyaluronidase\">hyaluronidase</a> enzymes to leak out of the sperm, making the sperm infertile.</p>\n<p>The safety of Smart RISUG is uncertain and requires additional research. The spermicidal properties of the compound should not have negative effects on the lining of the vas deferens. <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albino\" title=\"Albino\">Albino</a> rats used to develop the new polymer did not have any adverse symptoms.<a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-18\">[18]</a> The original compound had been tested for over 25 years in rats.<a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/#cite_note-Francis-7\">[7]</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"referencesedit\"><a aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading\" href=\"#referencesedit\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\"><use xlink:href=\"#svg-link\"></use></svg></a>References<a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Reversible_inhibition_of_sperm_under_guidance&#x26;action=edit&#x26;section=6\" title=\"Edit section: References\">Edit</a></h2>\n<ol>\n<li>^ <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/#cite_ref-dailypioneer_1-0\"><strong><em>a</em></strong></a> <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/#cite_ref-dailypioneer_1-1\"><strong><em>b</em></strong></a> Jyoti, Archana (2011-01-03). <a href=\"https://www.webcitation.org/5zHEacvXH?url=http://www.dailypioneer.com/307917/Poor-response-from-male-volunteers-hits-RISUG-clinical-trial.html\">\"Poor response from male volunteers hits RISUG clinical trial\"</a>. <em>[The Pioneer](&#x3C;<a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pioneer\">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pioneer</a></em>(Indian<em>newspaper)> \"The Pioneer (Indian newspaper)\")</em>.

Welcome to Noetic Noggin\n\nThis is [[my|archive.about]] personal wiki and a commonplace book; notes by me, for me.\n\n🚧 Permanently under construction 🚧\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/zubayr/image/upload/v1658499909/wiki/ajevkuyebljlxiblyst2.png)\n\nThis wiki was made possible with [dendron.so](https://dendron.so) and [obisidian.md](https://obsidian.md). Stored on [Github Repository](https://github.com/zubayrrr/dendron) and hosted on [Netlify](https://netlify.com) for free.\n\n## Principles\n\n### All notes should be relative to me.\n\n- All notes in principle are written for me; what I know about a subject, how I feel about a particular thing.\n- Opinions are fine as long as I feel strong epistemic confidence in the given opinion.\n- Don't over explain a note if it's not necessary, remember, these notes are for you and are relative to whatever knowledge you posses about the subject.\n- Read books and make an dedicated notes for them.\n- Listen podcasts but capture them inside a \"subject specific\" note or \"Map of Concept\" note or a note tagged #areas. Because making notes from podcasts can be tedious as they're not as well structured as books for consumption.(Whose merit is debatable.)\n- #areas are basically \"Map of Concept\" notes but I have recently come to the realization that its better to maintain them [Nikita Voloboev style](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/) but with heavy usage of transclusion and backlinking.\n  - \"Resources\" should be first processed and then mentioned inside the note, otherwise they should be left in inbox.\n\n### Gotta capture 'em all\n\n- Hog whatever information tickles your pickle([anything that gratifies one's intellectual curiosity](https://news.ycombinator.com/newsguidelines.html)).\n- [[swipes]] are interesting/useful bits of... [[quotes|swipes.quotes]], [[excerpts|swipes.excerpts]], [[sayings|swipes.sayings]], [[phrases|swipes.phrases]]. Essentially, ideas, opinions that are swiped off from [[others|resources.people]].\n- Make no distinction between \"your\" ideas and ideas of \"others\", because if you vibe with an idea; it's already yours.\n- But also remember \"If you've time to consume, you've time to produce.\".\n- Use [raindrop.io](https://raindrop.io) to manage your URL bookmarks.\n- If you need to bookmark a webpage or an article all together, use [MarkDownload](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/markdownload-markdown-web/pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi?hl=en-GB) to rip the entire page. Let's call it a [[webmark|inbox.webmark]]; it belong in the `/inbox`.\n- Similar process is employed for capturing tweets using [tweet-to-markdown](https://github.com/kbravh/tweet-to-markdown) and it also belongs in the `/inbox`.\n\n### Don't force evolution\n\n- Let your second brain evolve at it's own pace.\n- The structure should never be _too_ rigid because its meant to take form by itself.\n\n### Noise & Signal\n\n- While capturing ideas left and right is recommended, make sure you're not harming your periods of focus.\n- Have impenetrable focus periods (use Pomodoro method) where you only care about the work on hand and nothing else.\n\n### Why do any of this?\n\n- Because I can't remember everything - there's a lot of information around that interests me and there isn't enough working memory installed in me.\n- So, I make notes - to remember, to create, to meditate, to think.\n- A bodybuilder's portfolio is their body - my portfolio is my wiki.\n- Not only am I making - whatever I know - tangible by writing it down. I know exactly where to look if I ever forget something.\n- I am at the beginning of my learning adventures. When I look back at it, I will know where I came from and how my thoughts evolved over time.\n- Plus, its really fun to nerd out.\n\n## Structure of this wiki\n\n- [[slipbox.Ontology]] explains the structure of this wiki and the tags, backlinks used in it.\n- Dendron takes care of the structure and hierarchy(mostly), but I insist on using tags for backwards compatibility.\n\n## Quicklinks\n\n- [[About me|archive.about]]\n- [Github](https://github.com/zubayrrr)\n- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/zoobhalu)\n- [Blog](https://zubayrali.in)\n- [Guestbook](https://www.yourworldoftext.com/~zubayrali/)\n"},"collectionChildren":null,"customHeadContent":null,"config":{"version":5,"dev":{"enablePreviewV2":true,"enableSelfContainedVaults":true},"commands":{"lookup":{"note":{"selectionMode":"extract","confirmVaultOnCreate":true,"vaultSelectionModeOnCreate":"smart","leaveTrace":false,"bubbleUpCreateNew":true,"fuzzThreshold":0.2}},"randomNote":{},"insertNoteLink":{"aliasMode":"none","enableMultiSelect":false},"insertNoteIndex":{"enableMarker":false},"copyNoteLink":{},"templateHierarchy":"template","insertNote":{"initialValue":"templates"}},"workspace":{"vaults":[{"fsPath":".","selfContained":true,"name":"Dendron"}],"journal":{"dailyDomain":"daily","name":"journal","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd","addBehavior":"childOfDomain"},"scratch":{"name":"scratch","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd.HHmmss","addBehavior":"asOwnDomain"},"task":{"name":"task","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd","addBehavior":"asOwnDomain","statusSymbols":{"":" ","wip":"w","done":"x","assigned":"a","moved":"m","blocked":"b","delegated":"l","dropped":"d","pending":"y"},"taskCompleteStatus":["done","x"],"prioritySymbols":{"H":"high","M":"medium","L":"low"},"todoIntegration":false,"createTaskSelectionType":"selection2link"},"graph":{"zoomSpeed":1,"createStub":false},"enableAutoCreateOnDefinition":false,"enableHandlebarTemplates":true,"enableXVaultWikiLink":false,"enableRemoteVaultInit":true,"enableUserTags":true,"enableHashTags":true,"workspaceVaultSyncMode":"noCommit","enableAutoFoldFrontmatter":false,"enableEditorDecorations":true,"maxPreviewsCached":10,"maxNoteLength":204800,"enableFullHierarchyNoteTitle":false,"enableSmartRefs":true},"preview":{"enableFMTitle":true,"enableNoteTitleForLink":true,"enableFrontmatterTags":true,"enableHashesForFMTags":false,"enableMermaid":true,"enablePrettyRefs":true,"enableKatex":true,"automaticallyShowPreview":false},"publishing":{"theme":"dark","enableFMTitle":true,"enableNoteTitleForLink":true,"enableMermaid":true,"enablePrettyRefs":true,"enableKatex":true,"copyAssets":true,"siteHierarchies":["root"],"writeStubs":false,"siteRootDir":"docs","seo":{"title":"Noetic Noggin","description":"Personal Wiki / Digital Garden","author":"Zubayr Ali","twitter":"zoobhalu"},"github":{"enableEditLink":false,"editLinkText":"Edit this page on GitHub","editBranch":"main","editViewMode":"tree"},"enableSiteLastModified":true,"enableFrontmatterTags":true,"enableHashesForFMTags":false,"enableRandomlyColoredTags":true,"enableTaskNotes":true,"enablePrettyLinks":true,"siteUrl":"localhost:3000","siteFaviconPath":"favicon.ico","siteIndex":"root"}}},"__N_SSG":true}
