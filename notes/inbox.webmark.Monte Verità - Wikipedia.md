**Monte Verità** (Italian; German 'Berg Wahrheit', meaning "Mount Truth" or "Mountain of Truth") is a 321 [metres above sea level](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metres_above_the_Sea_(Switzerland) "Metres above the Sea (Switzerland)") high hill and a cultural-historical ensemble in the Swiss canton of [Ticino](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ticino "Ticino"). The site is in the municipality of [Ascona](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ascona "Ascona"), about half a kilometre north-west of the old town. Monte Verità, located on [Lake Maggiore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Maggiore "Lake Maggiore"), was a well-known meeting place for the life-reformers ([Lebensreform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebensreform "Lebensreform")), [pacifists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacifists "Pacifists"), artists, writers and supporters of various alternative movements in the first decades of the 20th century.[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Verit%C3%A0#cite_note-1)[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Verit%C3%A0#cite_note-DD-2) After 1940 the place lost its importance. An attempt at a revival in the late 1970s met with very limited success.
