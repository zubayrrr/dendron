- Internet Mail Application, operates on Port 143
- Provides e-mail clients to retrieve e-mail messages from a mail server over a [[devlog.tcp‚ÅÑip model]] connection.
- Allows the end user to view and manipulate the messages as if they're stored locally.
- Much better for modern communication in comparison to [[devlog.POP3]] because it keeps inboxes on [[devlog.Client]]/[[devlog.Server]] synchronized.
