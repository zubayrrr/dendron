**non compos mentis** is a Latin legal phrase that translates to "of unsound mind": nōn ("not") prefaces compos mentis, meaning "having control of one's mind." This phrase was first used in thirteenth-century English law to describe people afflicted by madness, the loss of memory or ability to reason.
