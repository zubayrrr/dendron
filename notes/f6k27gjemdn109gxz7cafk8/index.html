<p>from Zizek!</p>
<p>from I ♥ Huckabees</p>
<p>from Thank You For Smoking</p>
<p>Movies featuring a philosopher:<br>
Zizek!<br>
Examined Life<br>
Derrida<br>
The Ister<br>
The Pervert’s Guide To Cinema<br>
Being In The World (2010)*</p>
<p>Movies with philosopher as a character:<br>
Bill And Ted’s Excellent Adventure (2001)* (Tony Steedman as Socrates)<br>
When Neitzsche Wept (2007)* (Armand Assante as Friedrich Nietzsche)<br>
The Last Days Of Immanuel Kant (1994)* (David Warrilow as Immanuel Kant)<br>
The Alchemist Of Happiness (2004)* (Abol Reza Kermani as Ahmad al-Ghazali)<br>
Um Estrangeiro em Porto Alegre (1999)* (Nelson Diniz as Albert Camus)<br>
Cartesius (Ugo Cardea as René Descartes)<br>
Blaise Pascal ( Pierre Arditi as Blaise Pascal)<br>
Socrates (Jean Sylvère as Socrates)<br>
Socrates (1982)* (James Mason as Socrates)<br>
Augustine Of Hippo (Dary Berkani as St. Augustine)<br>
Beyond Good &#x26; Evil (Erland Josephson as Friedrich Nietzsche)<br>
Wittgenstein (Clancy Chassay as Young Ludwig Wittgenstein)<br>
Alexander (Christopher Plummer as Aristotle)</p>
<p>Famous thought experiments or discussion of a famous philosophical problem:<br>
Rashomon – General intro to Subjectivity/Objectivity<br>
Groundhog Day – Modern interpretation of The Myth of Sisyphus<br>
Being There – Socially constructed reality; what I like to call The Problem of Communication<br>
Being John Malkovich – The Inescapable Subjectivity of the Human Mind<br>
I ♥ Huckabees – Loose Adaptation of the History of Philosophy in Narrative Form<br>
A.I. – Any movie that has robots that think like humans will do<br>
Eternal Sunshine – Materialism; Metaphysics of Memories<br>
Minority Report – Freewill/Determinism<br>
The Matrix – Most people will say this is all based on Plato’s cave. I think Cartesian Dualism is a closer influence. The main reason for this is that one is not in the same body when in the Matrix as without. The distinction between consciousness and body was brought up famously by Descartes.<br>
The Truman Show – This is the true home of Plato’s Cave in modern movies. Although Truman never leaves the cave, a reality which he has only experienced as a shadow is implied and shown briefly.<br>
Thank You for Smoking – Pre-Socratic/Postmodern Rhetoric<br>
A Clockwork Orange – Person Identity; Political Theory; Justice; blah blah blah<br>
Lake Of Fire – Ethical considerations of abortion<br>
Inception – This film is brand new and is at the center of fierce discussion, which is the life blood of philosophical inquiry. As for the topics it raises itself: Although it can be argued that Nietzsche preceded Freud in discovery of the unconscious, the Freudian version is forefront in Inception. Freud’s psychoanalytic method had much to do with dreams and how they affect and describe us. Also, Cartesian skepticism, or The Problem of The External World, comes to surface.<br>
Pi – The Ontology of Numbers<br>
Waking Life – This feels more obligatory than anything else on here. If I include Alexander and Bill and Ted, I guess this one deserves to be here as well. But with all its pretension it actually offers a somewhat realistic cross section of the philosophical academic experience. Some thinkers sound like they are brilliantly laying out real solutions to real problems, some seem like they may be saying something insightful but are just not articulate enough, some are just too esoteric to tell and some are just simply on drugs.<br>
Stranger Than Fiction – The Authentic Individual<br>
Ikiru – Being-unto-death<br>
The Seventh Seal – The Angst Of The Absurd<br>
The Gods Must Be Crazy – I can’t even count how many times this movie was referenced in discussions about “Being and Time” by Martin Heidegger. The coke bottle is a piece of equipment that suddenly lands in a culture without the referential totality of coke bottles. As such, for the bushmen, the coke bottle ceases to be equipment though it retains readiness-to-hand as its mode of being.</p>
<p>Movies featuring the ideas of particular philosophers:<br>
Nietzsche (2003)*<br>
My Night At Maud’s<br>
Nietzsche and the Nazis (2006)*</p>
<p>Movies based on Novels written by famous philosophers:<br>
The Stranger (by Albert Camus)<br>
Le Journal Du Séducteur (1996)* (by Soren Kierkegaard)<br>
The Fountainhead (by Ann Rand)</p>
<p>Other:<br>
The Elegant Universe (2003)*<br>
M.A. Numminen Sings Wittgenstein (1993)* M.A. Numminen, accompanied by Pedro Hietanen, sings an excerpt from Ludwig Wittgenstein’s Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus in his inimitable style. -imdb</p>

Welcome to Noetic Noggin\n\nThis is [[my|archive.about]] personal wiki and a commonplace book; notes by me, for me.\n\n🚧 Permanently under construction 🚧\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/zubayr/image/upload/v1658499909/wiki/ajevkuyebljlxiblyst2.png)\n\nThis wiki was made possible with [dendron.so](https://dendron.so) and [obisidian.md](https://obsidian.md). Stored on [Github Repository](https://github.com/zubayrrr/dendron) and hosted on [Netlify](https://netlify.com) for free.\n\n## Principles\n\n### All notes should be relative to me.\n\n- All notes in principle are written for me; what I know about a subject, how I feel about a particular thing.\n- Opinions are fine as long as I feel strong epistemic confidence in the given opinion.\n- Don't over explain a note if it's not necessary, remember, these notes are for you and are relative to whatever knowledge you posses about the subject.\n- Read books and make an dedicated notes for them.\n- Listen podcasts but capture them inside a \"subject specific\" note or \"Map of Concept\" note or a note tagged #areas. Because making notes from podcasts can be tedious as they're not as well structured as books for consumption.(Whose merit is debatable.)\n- #areas are basically \"Map of Concept\" notes but I have recently come to the realization that its better to maintain them [Nikita Voloboev style](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/) but with heavy usage of transclusion and backlinking.\n  - \"Resources\" should be first processed and then mentioned inside the note, otherwise they should be left in inbox.\n\n### Gotta capture 'em all\n\n- Hog whatever information tickles your pickle([anything that gratifies one's intellectual curiosity](https://news.ycombinator.com/newsguidelines.html)).\n- [[swipes]] are interesting/useful bits of... [[quotes|swipes.quotes]], [[excerpts|swipes.excerpts]], [[sayings|swipes.sayings]], [[phrases|swipes.phrases]]. Essentially, ideas, opinions that are swiped off from [[others|resources.people]].\n- Make no distinction between \"your\" ideas and ideas of \"others\", because if you vibe with an idea; it's already yours.\n- But also remember \"If you've time to consume, you've time to produce.\".\n- Use [raindrop.io](https://raindrop.io) to manage your URL bookmarks.\n- If you need to bookmark a webpage or an article all together, use [MarkDownload](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/markdownload-markdown-web/pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi?hl=en-GB) to rip the entire page. Let's call it a [[webmark|inbox.webmark]]; it belong in the `/inbox`.\n- Similar process is employed for capturing tweets using [tweet-to-markdown](https://github.com/kbravh/tweet-to-markdown) and it also belongs in the `/inbox`.\n\n### Don't force evolution\n\n- Let your second brain evolve at it's own pace.\n- The structure should never be _too_ rigid because its meant to take form by itself.\n\n### Noise \u0026 Signal\n\n- While capturing ideas left and right is recommended, make sure you're not harming your periods of focus.\n- Have impenetrable focus periods (use Pomodoro method) where you only care about the work on hand and nothing else.\n\n### Why do any of this?\n\n- Because I can't remember everything - there's a lot of information around that interests me and there isn't enough working memory installed in me.\n- So, I make notes - to remember, to create, to meditate, to think.\n- A bodybuilder's portfolio is their body - my portfolio is my wiki.\n- Not only am I making - whatever I know - tangible by writing it down. I know exactly where to look if I ever forget something.\n- I am at the beginning of my learning adventures. When I look back at it, I will know where I came from and how my thoughts evolved over time.\n- Plus, its really fun to nerd out.\n\n## Structure of this wiki\n\n- [[slipbox.Ontology]] explains the structure of this wiki and the tags, backlinks used in it.\n- Dendron takes care of the structure and hierarchy(mostly), but I insist on using tags for backwards compatibility.\n\n## Quicklinks\n\n- [[About me|archive.about]]\n- [Github](https://github.com/zubayrrr)\n- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/zoobhalu)\n- [Blog](https://zubayrali.in)\n- [Guestbook](https://www.yourworldoftext.com/~zubayrali/)\n"},"collectionChildren":null,"customHeadContent":null,"config":{"version":5,"dev":{"enablePreviewV2":true,"enableSelfContainedVaults":true},"commands":{"lookup":{"note":{"selectionMode":"extract","confirmVaultOnCreate":true,"vaultSelectionModeOnCreate":"smart","leaveTrace":false,"bubbleUpCreateNew":true,"fuzzThreshold":0.2}},"randomNote":{},"insertNoteLink":{"aliasMode":"none","enableMultiSelect":false},"insertNoteIndex":{"enableMarker":false},"copyNoteLink":{},"templateHierarchy":"template","insertNote":{"initialValue":"templates"}},"workspace":{"vaults":[{"fsPath":".","selfContained":true,"name":"Dendron"}],"journal":{"dailyDomain":"daily","name":"journal","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd","addBehavior":"childOfDomain"},"scratch":{"name":"scratch","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd.HHmmss","addBehavior":"asOwnDomain"},"task":{"name":"task","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd","addBehavior":"asOwnDomain","statusSymbols":{"":" ","wip":"w","done":"x","assigned":"a","moved":"m","blocked":"b","delegated":"l","dropped":"d","pending":"y"},"taskCompleteStatus":["done","x"],"prioritySymbols":{"H":"high","M":"medium","L":"low"},"todoIntegration":false,"createTaskSelectionType":"selection2link"},"graph":{"zoomSpeed":1,"createStub":false},"enableAutoCreateOnDefinition":false,"enableHandlebarTemplates":true,"enableXVaultWikiLink":false,"enableRemoteVaultInit":true,"enableUserTags":true,"enableHashTags":true,"workspaceVaultSyncMode":"noCommit","enableAutoFoldFrontmatter":false,"enableEditorDecorations":true,"maxPreviewsCached":10,"maxNoteLength":204800,"enableFullHierarchyNoteTitle":false,"enableSmartRefs":true},"preview":{"enableFMTitle":true,"enableNoteTitleForLink":true,"enableFrontmatterTags":true,"enableHashesForFMTags":false,"enableMermaid":true,"enablePrettyRefs":true,"enableKatex":true,"automaticallyShowPreview":false},"publishing":{"theme":"dark","enableFMTitle":true,"enableNoteTitleForLink":true,"enableMermaid":true,"enablePrettyRefs":true,"enableKatex":true,"copyAssets":true,"siteHierarchies":["root"],"writeStubs":false,"siteRootDir":"docs","seo":{"title":"Noetic Noggin","description":"Personal Wiki / Digital Garden","author":"Zubayr Ali","twitter":"zoobhalu"},"github":{"enableEditLink":false,"editLinkText":"Edit this page on GitHub","editBranch":"main","editViewMode":"tree"},"enableSiteLastModified":true,"enableFrontmatterTags":true,"enableHashesForFMTags":false,"enableRandomlyColoredTags":true,"enableTaskNotes":true,"enablePrettyLinks":true,"siteUrl":"localhost:3000","siteFaviconPath":"favicon.ico","siteIndex":"root"}}},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/notes/[id]","query":{"id":"f6k27gjemdn109gxz7cafk8"},"buildId":"4oDSInv8WeDX6cVSprjyl","isFallback":false,"gsp":true,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
