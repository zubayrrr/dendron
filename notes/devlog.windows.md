## Windows File System

- It has multiple roots called drives.
- Within those drives, the hierarchy of files and folders is same.
- **Not everything is a file** unlike the [[devlog.unix]] OSes.
  - Devices are not treated as files.
- Windows uses backslashes (`\`) instead of forward slash like in [[devlog.unix]] for paths.
- Apps files are not split into different directories when installing them. They're installed at one location.
- Windows uses different shell commands, most commands available on [[devlog.linux]] are not available on Windows.
