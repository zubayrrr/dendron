### Cable Distribution System

- Is an organized system that is hierarchical in nature so we can figure out exactly where cabls should be laid so they're safe, secure and functional.

- [[Patch Panels - Copper]]
- [[Patch Panels - Fiber]]

Gives modularity and [[leeway]] to work things out, instead of changing the entire cable.

### Testing the Network

- Use a Toner Probe(Fox & Hound) to find which port is tied to the patch panel and also to test the wires of the cable.
