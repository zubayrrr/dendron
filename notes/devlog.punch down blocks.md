- Punch Down Blocks are located in either your main or intermediate distribution frame.
- 66 Block
  - Used for phones and older [[devlog.LAN]] wiring. This causes crosstalk due to proximity of cables and is a bad choice for higher-speed LAN wiring.
  - They should not be used for Cat 5 or above.
- 110 Block - modern
  - Used for higher-speed network wiring and is required for Cat 5 or above cabling.
