Cloud is a collection of services that create a platform which include:

- Media Services
- Databases
- Security

* These services come with a specific feature set aimed at making an organization's life easier by hosting these services for them in remotely.

* You can choose where in the world you want to run these services, access them remotely and fine tune them to your requirements.

- Saving the organization a lot of money had they hosted these services themselves.
