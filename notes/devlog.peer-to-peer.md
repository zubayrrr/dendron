Machines sharing resources directly among themselves.

Administration and backup is difficult as all the files and resources are located in different locations/machines.

- Pros:
  - Peer-to-Peer file sharing such as Napster
  - Lower cost
  - No dedicated resources
  - No specialized OS
- Cons:
  - Decentralized management
  - Inefficient for large networks
  - Poor scalability
