Do Nothing Tendency

We are more bothered by harm that comes from action than harm that comes from inaction, so we default to no action.

"Most of us have two lives: the life we live, and the unlived life within us"— [@SPressfield](https://twitter.com/SPressfield)

Don't resort to no action as a means of comfort.

[@SPressfield](https://twitter.com/SPressfield) Extremeness Aversion

When making decisions, we seek to avoid the outermost edge of a situation.

We prefer a compromise or middle position.

The middle option allows us to ‘sit on the fence.’

Remember: The edge is where the magic and learning happen.

[@SPressfield](https://twitter.com/SPressfield) Fundamental Attribution Error

We underemphasize situational factors and over-emphasize character traits in assessing others.

You haven't slept well so you know why you're slow, they haven't slept well so you assume they're a slow person.

View other's situations with charity.

[@SPressfield](https://twitter.com/SPressfield) Not Invented Here Bias

We get drunk on our own ideas—whether individual or in a business setting.

Sober up, take a step back.

Examine the quality of your ideas in hindsight.

Which of your ideas from the past 5 years were truly outstanding? My guess is a small few.

[@SPressfield](https://twitter.com/SPressfield) First-Conclusion Bias

We settle on the first information or conclusion for a given problem.

This makes us resistant to asking further questions and searching for further alternatives.

Counter this urge by using decision checklists and objective reasoning—remove your emotions.
