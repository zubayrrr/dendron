Novec™ 7100 engineered fluid is **a proprietary methoxy-nonafluorobutane from 3M™**. This hydrofluoroether is a clear, colorless and low-odor fluid intended to replace ozone-depleting substances (ODSs) and compounds with high global warming potential (GWP) in many applications. It has zero ozone depletion potential.

- It is also used to put out fires in museums, where water cannot be used.
