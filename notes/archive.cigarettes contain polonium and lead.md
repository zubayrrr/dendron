> The common dangers of cigarettes have been known for decades. However, few people know that tobacco also contains radioactive materials: polonium-210 and lead-210. Together, the toxic and radioactive substances in cigarettes harm smokers. They also harm people exposed to secondhand smoke.â€”via [Radiation Studies: CDC - Cigarette Smoking and Radiation](https://www.cdc.gov/nceh/radiation/smoking.htm)
