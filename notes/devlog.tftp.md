- Trivial File Transfer Protocol ([[devlog.FTP]]), operates on [[Port 69]]
- Transmits files in both directions of a [[devlog.Client]]-[[devlog.Server]] application.
- Used for booting an operating system from a local area network, file server.
- It is also used to request configuration files from [[devlog.router]]s and [[devlog.Switch]]es
- Doesn't provide user authentication or directory visibility.
- It is essentially a stripped down version of [[devlog.FTP]]
