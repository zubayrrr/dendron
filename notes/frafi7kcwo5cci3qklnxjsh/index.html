<p>To be honest, I can't think of anyone who doesn't take notes regularly. That could be for classes or courses they're taking, during meetings, while doing research or interviews, or just collecting information to add to a <a href="https://weeklymusings.net/weekly-musings-092">digital garden</a>.</p>
<p>While many people like to go the <a href="http://www.thecramped.com/">analog route</a> when taking notes, others cut out the middle person and type directly into text editor or note taking tool as they're working or listening. Using plain text for taking notes in those situations is quick. It's efficient. It just makes sense.</p>
<p>In the next few hundred words, I'd like to share some tactics that can make the process of taking notes with plain text a bit easier, a bit more efficient, and which can help give your notes a bit more structure.</p>
<h2 id="choose-your-weapon"><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading" href="#choose-your-weapon"><svg aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 16 16"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a>Choose Your Weapon</h2>
<p>I'm not going to tell you what the <em>best</em> tool for taking plain text notes is. Why? I don't what's best for your needs.</p>
<p>Instead, use the tool or application that you're most comfortable with. That could be a <a href="https://plaintextproject.online/2019/06/18/texted.html">text editor</a>. It could be a favourite <a href="https://plaintextproject.online/2018/03/01/standard.html">note taking</a> tool <a href="https://plaintextproject.online/2019/02/06/joplin.html">or the other</a>. Or it could be a wiki or a fancy new tool like Obsidian.</p>
<p>Don't dwell upon or obsess about what you're using. Don't fall into the tool fetishism trap. Make your choice. Use it. If it's not working out, swap your tools out at a later date.</p>
<h2 id="naming-files"><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading" href="#naming-files"><svg aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 16 16"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a>Naming Files</h2>
<p>Think about the function or purpose of the file. Then, use that function or purpose in the name of a file.</p>
<p>What do I mean by function or purpose? Let’s say you’re taking notes for a course you're taking. You might decide to have a separate file for each class or lecture. In that case, you can name your files something like this:</p>
<p><code>[course-name]-[subject]-[date].txt</code></p>
<p>For example, <em>Cambodian-History101-Angkorian-Era-2021-06-01.txt</em>.</p>
<p>If you're taking notes as part of a large project, include the project’s name (or acronym) in the file name. When, for example, I was taking notes for my book <em><a href="https://scottnesbitt.gumroad.com/l/learnhtml">HTML for Writers</a></em>, I used file names like this:</p>
<p><code>HTML_Book-ch1.txt</code></p>
<p>Regardless of how you name your files, make sure they're easy to identify if you're searching for or scanning for them.</p>
<h2 id="structuring-your-files"><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading" href="#structuring-your-files"><svg aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 16 16"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a>Structuring Your Files</h2>
<p>You shouldn't worry too much about the structure of your notes at this point. Becoming preoccupied with structure will slow down your note taking flow.</p>
<p>At the very least, add headings to the file where and when needed. Usually, that's to denote a logical separation of ideas. Don't get too fancy at this point — just have the heading in title case or all capitals on its own line in the file.</p>
<p>You can also prepare a text file ahead of time by adding some metadata to the top of that file. The metadata helps identify the context of your notes. Here's an example:</p>
<pre><code>INTERVIEW SUBJECT: Someone Interesting
TOPIC: Background for article on XYZ
DATE: 17 December, 2021
</code></pre>
<p>You can learn more about that in <a href="https://plaintextproject.online/2020/04/14/structure.html#how-to-add-structure">a previous article</a></p>
<h2 id="use-point-form"><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading" href="#use-point-form"><svg aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 16 16"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a>Use Point Form</h2>
<p>Don't try to take everything down, especially if you're in a lecture or a meeting. If you do, you'll miss more than record. Instead, focus on taking down key points and keywords. Use those points and keywords to jog you memory later, or to give you a base from which to do further research.</p>
<p>The best way to do that is to write in point form. Use sentence fragments rather than full sentences. Again, when you go back to your notes later, you can flesh out those sentence fragments. Not just expanding them into full sentences, but also adding more information and context.</p>
<p>When I take notes, I often use point form literally — every idea or line is a bullet point, denoted by an asterisk or a dash.</p>
<h2 id="should-you-markup-your"><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading" href="#should-you-markup-your"><svg aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 16 16"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a>Should You Markup Your?</h2>
<p>By that, I mean adding formatting with a lightweight markup language like <a href="https://scottnesbitt.gumroad.com/l/learnmarkdown">Markdown</a>. I don't think you should, at least not while taking notes. Doing that can can break up your note taking flow.</p>
<p>Instead, add any markup after you finish taking your notes. That can give you time think about what (if anything) needs to be marked up.</p>
<h2 id="organizing-your-files"><a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor-heading" href="#organizing-your-files"><svg aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 16 16"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a>Organizing Your Files</h2>
<p>Taking notes is all well and good, but your notes are useless if you can't find them. Organization is the key to effectively using your notes.</p>
<p>First off, think about whether you going to keep your notes in one large file or multiple small ones. I discussed the pros and cons of both approaches in <a href="https://plaintextproject.online/2019/10/01/single-multiple.html">an article</a> from 2019.</p>
<p>Next, think about how you're going to store your notes. I prefer to create folders based on projects or topics — whether in a note taking tool or on my computer. The folders not only contain my notes, but also give them context. I look at how to do this effectively <a href="https://plaintextproject.online/2019/11/05/folders.html">in another article</a> in this space.</p>

<p>Using plain text to take notes can be a quick and efficient way of doing the deed. The tactic I've outlined in this article can enhance the process of taking notes and can help make those notes easier to find and use.</p>

When, for example, I was taking notes for my book \u003cem\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://scottnesbitt.gumroad.com/l/learnhtml\"\u003eHTML for Writers\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/em\u003e, I used file names like this:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ccode\u003eHTML_Book-ch1.txt\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRegardless of how you name your files, make sure they're easy to identify if you're searching for or scanning for them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"structuring-your-files\"\u003e\u003ca aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading\" href=\"#structuring-your-files\"\u003e\u003csvg aria-hidden=\"true\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\"\u003e\u003cuse xlink:href=\"#svg-link\"\u003e\u003c/use\u003e\u003c/svg\u003e\u003c/a\u003eStructuring Your Files\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou shouldn't worry too much about the structure of your notes at this point. Becoming preoccupied with structure will slow down your note taking flow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the very least, add headings to the file where and when needed. Usually, that's to denote a logical separation of ideas. Don't get too fancy at this point — just have the heading in title case or all capitals on its own line in the file.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou can also prepare a text file ahead of time by adding some metadata to the top of that file. The metadata helps identify the context of your notes. Here's an example:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cpre\u003e\u003ccode\u003eINTERVIEW SUBJECT: Someone Interesting\nTOPIC: Background for article on XYZ\nDATE: 17 December, 2021\n\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou can learn more about that in \u003ca href=\"https://plaintextproject.online/2020/04/14/structure.html#how-to-add-structure\"\u003ea previous article\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"use-point-form\"\u003e\u003ca aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading\" href=\"#use-point-form\"\u003e\u003csvg aria-hidden=\"true\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\"\u003e\u003cuse xlink:href=\"#svg-link\"\u003e\u003c/use\u003e\u003c/svg\u003e\u003c/a\u003eUse Point Form\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDon't try to take everything down, especially if you're in a lecture or a meeting. If you do, you'll miss more than record. Instead, focus on taking down key points and keywords. Use those points and keywords to jog you memory later, or to give you a base from which to do further research.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe best way to do that is to write in point form. Use sentence fragments rather than full sentences. Again, when you go back to your notes later, you can flesh out those sentence fragments. Not just expanding them into full sentences, but also adding more information and context.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen I take notes, I often use point form literally — every idea or line is a bullet point, denoted by an asterisk or a dash.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"should-you-markup-your\"\u003e\u003ca aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading\" href=\"#should-you-markup-your\"\u003e\u003csvg aria-hidden=\"true\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\"\u003e\u003cuse xlink:href=\"#svg-link\"\u003e\u003c/use\u003e\u003c/svg\u003e\u003c/a\u003eShould You Markup Your?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy that, I mean adding formatting with a lightweight markup language like \u003ca href=\"https://scottnesbitt.gumroad.com/l/learnmarkdown\"\u003eMarkdown\u003c/a\u003e. I don't think you should, at least not while taking notes. Doing that can can break up your note taking flow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstead, add any markup after you finish taking your notes. That can give you time think about what (if anything) needs to be marked up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"organizing-your-files\"\u003e\u003ca aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading\" href=\"#organizing-your-files\"\u003e\u003csvg aria-hidden=\"true\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\"\u003e\u003cuse xlink:href=\"#svg-link\"\u003e\u003c/use\u003e\u003c/svg\u003e\u003c/a\u003eOrganizing Your Files\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTaking notes is all well and good, but your notes are useless if you can't find them. Organization is the key to effectively using your notes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFirst off, think about whether you going to keep your notes in one large file or multiple small ones. I discussed the pros and cons of both approaches in \u003ca href=\"https://plaintextproject.online/2019/10/01/single-multiple.html\"\u003ean article\u003c/a\u003e from 2019.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNext, think about how you're going to store your notes. I prefer to create folders based on projects or topics — whether in a note taking tool or on my computer. The folders not only contain my notes, but also give them context. I look at how to do this effectively \u003ca href=\"https://plaintextproject.online/2019/11/05/folders.html\"\u003ein another article\u003c/a\u003e in this space.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"final-thoughts\"\u003e\u003ca aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor-heading\" href=\"#final-thoughts\"\u003e\u003csvg aria-hidden=\"true\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\"\u003e\u003cuse xlink:href=\"#svg-link\"\u003e\u003c/use\u003e\u003c/svg\u003e\u003c/a\u003eFinal Thoughts\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUsing plain text to take notes can be a quick and efficient way of doing the deed.

Welcome to Noetic Noggin\n\nThis is [[my|archive.about]] personal wiki and a commonplace book; notes by me, for me.\n\n🚧 Permanently under construction 🚧\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/zubayr/image/upload/v1658499909/wiki/ajevkuyebljlxiblyst2.png)\n\nThis wiki was made possible with [dendron.so](https://dendron.so) and [obisidian.md](https://obsidian.md). Stored on [Github Repository](https://github.com/zubayrrr/dendron) and hosted on [Netlify](https://netlify.com) for free.\n\n## Principles\n\n### All notes should be relative to me.\n\n- All notes in principle are written for me; what I know about a subject, how I feel about a particular thing.\n- Opinions are fine as long as I feel strong epistemic confidence in the given opinion.\n- Don't over explain a note if it's not necessary, remember, these notes are for you and are relative to whatever knowledge you posses about the subject.\n- Read books and make an dedicated notes for them.\n- Listen podcasts but capture them inside a \"subject specific\" note or \"Map of Concept\" note or a note tagged #areas. Because making notes from podcasts can be tedious as they're not as well structured as books for consumption.(Whose merit is debatable.)\n- #areas are basically \"Map of Concept\" notes but I have recently come to the realization that its better to maintain them [Nikita Voloboev style](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/) but with heavy usage of transclusion and backlinking.\n  - \"Resources\" should be first processed and then mentioned inside the note, otherwise they should be left in inbox.\n\n### Gotta capture 'em all\n\n- Hog whatever information tickles your pickle([anything that gratifies one's intellectual curiosity](https://news.ycombinator.com/newsguidelines.html)).\n- [[swipes]] are interesting/useful bits of... [[quotes|swipes.quotes]], [[excerpts|swipes.excerpts]], [[sayings|swipes.sayings]], [[phrases|swipes.phrases]]. Essentially, ideas, opinions that are swiped off from [[others|resources.people]].\n- Make no distinction between \"your\" ideas and ideas of \"others\", because if you vibe with an idea; it's already yours.\n- But also remember \"If you've time to consume, you've time to produce.\".\n- Use [raindrop.io](https://raindrop.io) to manage your URL bookmarks.\n- If you need to bookmark a webpage or an article all together, use [MarkDownload](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/markdownload-markdown-web/pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi?hl=en-GB) to rip the entire page. Let's call it a [[webmark|inbox.webmark]]; it belong in the `/inbox`.\n- Similar process is employed for capturing tweets using [tweet-to-markdown](https://github.com/kbravh/tweet-to-markdown) and it also belongs in the `/inbox`.\n\n### Don't force evolution\n\n- Let your second brain evolve at it's own pace.\n- The structure should never be _too_ rigid because its meant to take form by itself.\n\n### Noise \u0026 Signal\n\n- While capturing ideas left and right is recommended, make sure you're not harming your periods of focus.\n- Have impenetrable focus periods (use Pomodoro method) where you only care about the work on hand and nothing else.\n\n### Why do any of this?\n\n- Because I can't remember everything - there's a lot of information around that interests me and there isn't enough working memory installed in me.\n- So, I make notes - to remember, to create, to meditate, to think.\n- A bodybuilder's portfolio is their body - my portfolio is my wiki.\n- Not only am I making - whatever I know - tangible by writing it down. I know exactly where to look if I ever forget something.\n- I am at the beginning of my learning adventures. When I look back at it, I will know where I came from and how my thoughts evolved over time.\n- Plus, its really fun to nerd out.\n\n## Structure of this wiki\n\n- [[slipbox.Ontology]] explains the structure of this wiki and the tags, backlinks used in it.\n- Dendron takes care of the structure and hierarchy(mostly), but I insist on using tags for backwards compatibility.\n\n## Quicklinks\n\n- [[About me|archive.about]]\n- [Github](https://github.com/zubayrrr)\n- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/zoobhalu)\n- [Blog](https://zubayrali.in)\n- [Guestbook](https://www.yourworldoftext.com/~zubayrali/)\n"},"collectionChildren":null,"customHeadContent":null,"config":{"version":5,"dev":{"enablePreviewV2":true,"enableSelfContainedVaults":true},"commands":{"lookup":{"note":{"selectionMode":"extract","confirmVaultOnCreate":true,"vaultSelectionModeOnCreate":"smart","leaveTrace":false,"bubbleUpCreateNew":true,"fuzzThreshold":0.2}},"randomNote":{},"insertNoteLink":{"aliasMode":"none","enableMultiSelect":false},"insertNoteIndex":{"enableMarker":false},"copyNoteLink":{},"templateHierarchy":"template","insertNote":{"initialValue":"templates"}},"workspace":{"vaults":[{"fsPath":".","selfContained":true,"name":"Dendron"}],"journal":{"dailyDomain":"daily","name":"journal","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd","addBehavior":"childOfDomain"},"scratch":{"name":"scratch","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd.HHmmss","addBehavior":"asOwnDomain"},"task":{"name":"task","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd","addBehavior":"asOwnDomain","statusSymbols":{"":" ","wip":"w","done":"x","assigned":"a","moved":"m","blocked":"b","delegated":"l","dropped":"d","pending":"y"},"taskCompleteStatus":["done","x"],"prioritySymbols":{"H":"high","M":"medium","L":"low"},"todoIntegration":false,"createTaskSelectionType":"selection2link"},"graph":{"zoomSpeed":1,"createStub":false},"enableAutoCreateOnDefinition":false,"enableHandlebarTemplates":true,"enableXVaultWikiLink":false,"enableRemoteVaultInit":true,"enableUserTags":true,"enableHashTags":true,"workspaceVaultSyncMode":"noCommit","enableAutoFoldFrontmatter":false,"enableEditorDecorations":true,"maxPreviewsCached":10,"maxNoteLength":204800,"enableFullHierarchyNoteTitle":false,"enableSmartRefs":true},"preview":{"enableFMTitle":true,"enableNoteTitleForLink":true,"enableFrontmatterTags":true,"enableHashesForFMTags":false,"enableMermaid":true,"enablePrettyRefs":true,"enableKatex":true,"automaticallyShowPreview":false},"publishing":{"theme":"dark","enableFMTitle":true,"enableNoteTitleForLink":true,"enableMermaid":true,"enablePrettyRefs":true,"enableKatex":true,"copyAssets":true,"siteHierarchies":["root"],"writeStubs":false,"siteRootDir":"docs","seo":{"title":"Noetic Noggin","description":"Personal Wiki / Digital Garden","author":"Zubayr Ali","twitter":"zoobhalu"},"github":{"enableEditLink":false,"editLinkText":"Edit this page on GitHub","editBranch":"main","editViewMode":"tree"},"enableSiteLastModified":true,"enableFrontmatterTags":true,"enableHashesForFMTags":false,"enableRandomlyColoredTags":true,"enableTaskNotes":true,"enablePrettyLinks":true,"siteUrl":"localhost:3000","siteFaviconPath":"favicon.ico","siteIndex":"root"}}},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/notes/[id]","query":{"id":"frafi7kcwo5cci3qklnxjsh"},"buildId":"4oDSInv8WeDX6cVSprjyl","isFallback":false,"gsp":true,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
