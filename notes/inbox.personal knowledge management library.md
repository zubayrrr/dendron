### **Intro**

### **Who is this for?**

-   You want to learn how to organize your personal knowledge
-   You wonder how to take smart notes
-   You want to remember more of what you read
-   You want to improve your knowledge management skills

If concepts/acronyms such as PKM, SecondBrain, Zettelkasten, Evergreen notes, and Digital Garden make you curious, then you've come to the right place!

It is well-known that our memories are not reliable. To store and organize knowledge bases, we need digital solutions to help us. But that's *not enough*. To keep things manageable over time as our knowledge base scales, we need clear techniques and methodologies.

### What is this?

I've been passionate about information, knowledge management, and PKM for more than 20 years. As a knowledge worker, author, blogger, and entrepreneur, I needed solutions to store and organize an enormous amount of information.

Over the years, I've explored, used, and advocated many different tools: old-school wikis (e.g., MediaWiki, TiddlyWiki, DokuWiki, Confluence), note-taking solutions such as Evernote, Google Keep, Microsoft OneNote, Okular, Zim, and many more.

Recently, the Personal Knowledge Management space has evolved **a lot** with the rise of tools such as Notion, Obsidian, Roam Research, LogSeq, and others. Those have *drastically* changed the knowledge management landscape and brought us the opportunity to manage knowledge much more efficiently, and to truly create ourselves a second brain, or digital garden.

During most of 2021, I've done extensive research and curated a ton of information and links about the Personal Knowledge Management space. I've now regrouped all of this inside of a Notion space.

It is now a solid database of the best resources you can find on the subject around the Internet

**Each and every week I add new resources to this Notion space:** articles, blogs, books, courses, tools, videos, etc. This includes the content that I [publish](https://dsebastien.net/blog/2021-12-03-personal-knowledge-management-organization) [myself](https://dsebastien.net/blog/2021-10-07-periodic-journaling-part-1) on [the subject](https://dsebastien.net/blog/2022-02-08-why-you-should-take-notes-while-reading) and [my weekly newsletter](https://newsletter.dsebastien.net/).
