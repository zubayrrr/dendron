## ITSM

IT service management -- often referred to as ITSM -- is simply how IT teams manage the end-to-end delivery of IT services to customers. This includes all the processes and activities to design, create, deliver, and support IT services.

The core concept of ITSM is the belief that IT should be delivered as a service. A typical ITSM scenario could involve asking for new hardware like a laptop. You would submit your request through a portal, filling out a ticket with all relevant information, and kicking off a repeatable workflow. Then, the ticket would land in the IT teamâ€™s queue, where incoming requests are sorted and addressed according to importance.

## ITIL

ITIL (Information Technology Infrastructure Library) is a widely accepted set of best practices that is designed to support an organization in gaining optimal value from IT by aligning IT services with business strategy.

ITIL was created with ITSM in mind. But the distinction between the two can be boiled down to one idea: ITIL is a framework or a set of guidelines to assist in implementing the activities involved in ITSM.

## Notes

Difference between ITSM and ITIL is akin to the one between [[Agile and Scrum|devlog.agile & scrum]]. While ITSM (or Agile) is a methodology, ITIL (or Scrum) is a framework for implementing that methodology.
