Application Programming Interface.

It is essentially a software intermediary that allows two applications or an application and a server to communicate.

APIs operate as a bridge between applications, allowing them to communicate more efficiently. APIs can be categorized into various types based on application designs and other constraints, such as Web API, [[devlog.HTTP API]], [[devlog.REST API]], [[devlog.WebSockets API]] and many more.
