<p><a href="https://fs.blog/intellectual-giants/peter-bevelin/">Peter Bevelin</a>‘s first book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1578644283/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&#x26;camp=1789&#x26;creative=9325&#x26;creativeASIN=1578644283&#x26;linkCode=as2&#x26;tag=farnamstreet-20">Seeking Wisdom from Darwin to Munger</a>, is one of the best books you’ve probably never heard of.

<blockquote>
<p>“Peter Bevelin is one of the wisest people on the planet.”</p>
<p>— Nassim Taleb</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’m a big fan of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0553328255/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&#x26;tag=farnamstreet-20&#x26;creative=9325&#x26;linkCode=as2&#x26;creativeASIN=0553328255&#x26;linkId=fa64dbdee7ceb41df26123f97821054f">Sherlock Holmes</a>, and Peter is not the first person to explore the wisdom that can be drawn. Maria Konnikova’s book, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0670026573/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&#x26;tag=farnamstreet-20&#x26;creative=9325&#x26;linkCode=as2&#x26;creativeASIN=0670026573&#x26;linkId=3cc69470cef29fb1bf4a55947dbc8cfb">Mastermind: How To Think Like Sherlock Holmes</a>, <a href="https://fs.blog/2013/04/how-to-think-like-sherlock-holmes/">takes a deep look at Sherlock Holmes’s methodology</a> to develop the habits of mind that will allow us to mindfully engage the world.</p>
<p>Peter’s book is shorter than Maria’s and encourages you to draw your own conclusions. He’s distilled Arthur Conan Doyle’s famous detective Sherlock Holmes into principles and quotes.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This book will appeal to both Sherlock fans as well as those who want to think better. It contains useful and timeless methods and questions applicable to a variety of important issues in life and business. We could all benefit from A few lessons from Sherlock Holmes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let’s look at some of the lessons Bevelin brings to our attention.</p>
<p>“What distinguishes Holmes from most mortals,” Bevelin writes, “is that he knows where to look and what questions to ask. He pays attention to the important things, and he knows where to find them.”</p>
<p>Many ideas over a wide range of disciplines help us gain perspective (queue <a href="https://fs.blog/mental-models/">mental models</a>).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Breadth of view, my dear Mr. Mac, is one of the essentials of our profession. The interplay of ideas and the oblique uses of knowledge are often of extraordinary interest.(Holmes; <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00ARGXFAO/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&#x26;tag=farnamstreet-20&#x26;creative=9325&#x26;linkCode=as2&#x26;creativeASIN=B00ARGXFAO&#x26;linkId=bbb0f49108cdb2ad87c960ca4c526243">The Valley of Fear</a>)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I consider that a man’s brain originally is like a little empty attic, and you have to stock it with such furniture as you choose. A fool takes in all the lumber of every sort that he comes across, so that the knowledge which might be useful to him gets crowded out, or at best is jumbled up with a lot of other things so that he has a difficulty in laying his hands upon it.</p>
<p>Now the skillful workman is very careful indeed as to what he takes into his brain-attic. He will have nothing but the tools which may help him in doing his work, but of these he has a large assortment, and all in the most perfect order. It is a mistake to think that that little room has elastic walls and can distend to any extent. Depend upon it there comes a time when for every addition of knowledge you forget something that you knew before. It is of the highest importance, therefore, not to have useless facts elbowing out the useful ones. (Holmes; <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00ARGXLIK/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&#x26;tag=farnamstreet-20&#x26;creative=9325&#x26;linkCode=as2&#x26;creativeASIN=B00ARGXLIK&#x26;linkId=f79395bf7ed794845bde036504f9d356">A Study in Scarlet</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>So says the statistician.</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>You can, for example, never foretell what any one man will do, but you can say with precision what an average number will be up to. Individuals vary, but percentages remain constant. (Holmes; <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00ARGXFAY/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&#x26;tag=farnamstreet-20&#x26;creative=9325&#x26;linkCode=as2&#x26;creativeASIN=B00ARGXFAY&#x26;linkId=6ab7bbe1fa41fe743a4b5d0055711fe0">The Sign of the Fear</a>)</p>

<p>One of the best things about Peter is how he adds outsiders to the mix. He inserts this quote from Montaigne:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Judgment can do without knowledge but not knowledge without judgment. (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0140446044/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&#x26;tag=farnamstreet-20&#x26;creative=9325&#x26;linkCode=as2&#x26;creativeASIN=0140446044&#x26;linkId=cc546c8303536eb7c8ae4fa3c89ea2db">Montaigne</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Never jump to conclusions.</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I have not all my facts yet, but I do not think there are any insuperable difficulties. Still, it is an error to argue in front of your data. You find yourself insensibly twisting them round to fit your theories. (Holmes; <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0082XIBCQ/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&#x26;tag=farnamstreet-20&#x26;creative=9325&#x26;linkCode=as2&#x26;creativeASIN=B0082XIBCQ&#x26;linkId=e95d28127b67c20a885125343e533ee2">Wisteria Lodge</a>)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It is a capital mistake to theorize before one has data. Insensibly one begins to twist facts to suit theories, instead of theories to suit facts. (Holmes; <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1405862335/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&#x26;tag=farnamstreet-20&#x26;creative=9325&#x26;linkCode=as2&#x26;creativeASIN=1405862335&#x26;linkId=6f72de7e051e50a4b679848467ccd882">A Scandal in Bohemia</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Make sure the facts are facts.</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>I realize that if you ask people to account for “facts”, they usually spend more time finding reasons for them than finding out whether they are true. … They skip over the facts but carefully deduce inferences. They normally begin thus: “How does this come about?” But does it do so? That is what they ought to be asking. (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0140446044/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&#x26;tag=farnamstreet-20&#x26;creative=9325&#x26;linkCode=as2&#x26;creativeASIN=0140446044&#x26;linkId=55505a1790439124620d7bb2b0708009">Montaigne</a>)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The principal difficulty in your case … lay in the fact of there being too much evidence. What was vital was overlaid and hidden by what was irrelevant. Of all the facts which were presented to us we had to pick just those which we deemed to be essential, and then piece them together in their order, so as to reconstruct this very remarkable chain of events. (Holmes; <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00AR1TDQE/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&#x26;tag=farnamstreet-20&#x26;creative=9325&#x26;linkCode=as2&#x26;creativeASIN=B00AR1TDQE&#x26;linkId=d687b49f2297eee63a72b5feeeca6170">The Naval Treaty</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Small things may be important.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The smallest point may be the most essential.

<blockquote>
<p>What we see is all we think is there — What often leads us astray in an investigation is that we adopt the theory which is most likely to account for the “visible” and found facts but what if the important is left out? What is not reported, withheld, hidden?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Take time to think things over.</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sherlock Holmes was a man … who, when he had an unsolved problem upon his mind, would go for days, and even for a week, without rest, turning it over, rearranging his facts, looking at it from every point of view until he had either fathomed it or convinced himself that his data were insufficient. (Dr. Watson; <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07BRK4WK6/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&#x26;tag=farnamstreet-20&#x26;creative=9325&#x26;linkCode=as2&#x26;creativeASIN=B07BRK4WK6&#x26;linkId=a0b9fd92948579ebb6171927aeb7e332">The Man with the Twisted Lip</a>)</p>

It is a mistake to think that that little room has elastic walls and can distend to any extent. Depend upon it there comes a time when for every addition of knowledge you forget something that you knew before. It is of the highest importance, therefore, not to have useless facts elbowing out the useful ones.

Welcome to Noetic Noggin\n\nThis is [[my|archive.about]] personal wiki and a commonplace book; notes by me, for me.\n\n🚧 Permanently under construction 🚧\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/zubayr/image/upload/v1658499909/wiki/ajevkuyebljlxiblyst2.png)\n\nThis wiki was made possible with [dendron.so](https://dendron.so) and [obisidian.md](https://obsidian.md). Stored on [Github Repository](https://github.com/zubayrrr/dendron) and hosted on [Netlify](https://netlify.com) for free.\n\n## Principles\n\n### All notes should be relative to me.\n\n- All notes in principle are written for me; what I know about a subject, how I feel about a particular thing.\n- Opinions are fine as long as I feel strong epistemic confidence in the given opinion.\n- Don't over explain a note if it's not necessary, remember, these notes are for you and are relative to whatever knowledge you posses about the subject.\n- Read books and make an dedicated notes for them.\n- Listen podcasts but capture them inside a \"subject specific\" note or \"Map of Concept\" note or a note tagged #areas. Because making notes from podcasts can be tedious as they're not as well structured as books for consumption.(Whose merit is debatable.)\n- #areas are basically \"Map of Concept\" notes but I have recently come to the realization that its better to maintain them [Nikita Voloboev style](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/) but with heavy usage of transclusion and backlinking.\n  - \"Resources\" should be first processed and then mentioned inside the note, otherwise they should be left in inbox.\n\n### Gotta capture 'em all\n\n- Hog whatever information tickles your pickle([anything that gratifies one's intellectual curiosity](https://news.ycombinator.com/newsguidelines.html)).\n- [[swipes]] are interesting/useful bits of... [[quotes|swipes.quotes]], [[excerpts|swipes.excerpts]], [[sayings|swipes.sayings]], [[phrases|swipes.phrases]]. Essentially, ideas, opinions that are swiped off from [[others|resources.people]].\n- Make no distinction between \"your\" ideas and ideas of \"others\", because if you vibe with an idea; it's already yours.\n- But also remember \"If you've time to consume, you've time to produce.\".\n- Use [raindrop.io](https://raindrop.io) to manage your URL bookmarks.\n- If you need to bookmark a webpage or an article all together, use [MarkDownload](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/markdownload-markdown-web/pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi?hl=en-GB) to rip the entire page. Let's call it a [[webmark|inbox.webmark]]; it belong in the `/inbox`.\n- Similar process is employed for capturing tweets using [tweet-to-markdown](https://github.com/kbravh/tweet-to-markdown) and it also belongs in the `/inbox`.\n\n### Don't force evolution\n\n- Let your second brain evolve at it's own pace.\n- The structure should never be _too_ rigid because its meant to take form by itself.\n\n### Noise \u0026 Signal\n\n- While capturing ideas left and right is recommended, make sure you're not harming your periods of focus.\n- Have impenetrable focus periods (use Pomodoro method) where you only care about the work on hand and nothing else.\n\n### Why do any of this?\n\n- Because I can't remember everything - there's a lot of information around that interests me and there isn't enough working memory installed in me.\n- So, I make notes - to remember, to create, to meditate, to think.\n- A bodybuilder's portfolio is their body - my portfolio is my wiki.\n- Not only am I making - whatever I know - tangible by writing it down. I know exactly where to look if I ever forget something.\n- I am at the beginning of my learning adventures. When I look back at it, I will know where I came from and how my thoughts evolved over time.\n- Plus, its really fun to nerd out.\n\n## Structure of this wiki\n\n- [[slipbox.Ontology]] explains the structure of this wiki and the tags, backlinks used in it.\n- Dendron takes care of the structure and hierarchy(mostly), but I insist on using tags for backwards compatibility.\n\n## Quicklinks\n\n- [[About me|archive.about]]\n- [Github](https://github.com/zubayrrr)\n- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/zoobhalu)\n- [Blog](https://zubayrali.in)\n- [Guestbook](https://www.yourworldoftext.com/~zubayrali/)\n"},"collectionChildren":null,"customHeadContent":null,"config":{"version":5,"dev":{"enablePreviewV2":true,"enableSelfContainedVaults":true},"commands":{"lookup":{"note":{"selectionMode":"extract","confirmVaultOnCreate":true,"vaultSelectionModeOnCreate":"smart","leaveTrace":false,"bubbleUpCreateNew":true,"fuzzThreshold":0.2}},"randomNote":{},"insertNoteLink":{"aliasMode":"none","enableMultiSelect":false},"insertNoteIndex":{"enableMarker":false},"copyNoteLink":{},"templateHierarchy":"template","insertNote":{"initialValue":"templates"}},"workspace":{"vaults":[{"fsPath":".","selfContained":true,"name":"Dendron"}],"journal":{"dailyDomain":"daily","name":"journal","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd","addBehavior":"childOfDomain"},"scratch":{"name":"scratch","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd.HHmmss","addBehavior":"asOwnDomain"},"task":{"name":"task","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd","addBehavior":"asOwnDomain","statusSymbols":{"":" ","wip":"w","done":"x","assigned":"a","moved":"m","blocked":"b","delegated":"l","dropped":"d","pending":"y"},"taskCompleteStatus":["done","x"],"prioritySymbols":{"H":"high","M":"medium","L":"low"},"todoIntegration":false,"createTaskSelectionType":"selection2link"},"graph":{"zoomSpeed":1,"createStub":false},"enableAutoCreateOnDefinition":false,"enableHandlebarTemplates":true,"enableXVaultWikiLink":false,"enableRemoteVaultInit":true,"enableUserTags":true,"enableHashTags":true,"workspaceVaultSyncMode":"noCommit","enableAutoFoldFrontmatter":false,"enableEditorDecorations":true,"maxPreviewsCached":10,"maxNoteLength":204800,"enableFullHierarchyNoteTitle":false,"enableSmartRefs":true},"preview":{"enableFMTitle":true,"enableNoteTitleForLink":true,"enableFrontmatterTags":true,"enableHashesForFMTags":false,"enableMermaid":true,"enablePrettyRefs":true,"enableKatex":true,"automaticallyShowPreview":false},"publishing":{"theme":"dark","enableFMTitle":true,"enableNoteTitleForLink":true,"enableMermaid":true,"enablePrettyRefs":true,"enableKatex":true,"copyAssets":true,"siteHierarchies":["root"],"writeStubs":false,"siteRootDir":"docs","seo":{"title":"Noetic Noggin","description":"Personal Wiki / Digital Garden","author":"Zubayr Ali","twitter":"zoobhalu"},"github":{"enableEditLink":false,"editLinkText":"Edit this page on GitHub","editBranch":"main","editViewMode":"tree"},"enableSiteLastModified":true,"enableFrontmatterTags":true,"enableHashesForFMTags":false,"enableRandomlyColoredTags":true,"enableTaskNotes":true,"enablePrettyLinks":true,"siteUrl":"localhost:3000","siteFaviconPath":"favicon.ico","siteIndex":"root"}}},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/notes/[id]","query":{"id":"8din61bnj6b2y1v6r71ifo4"},"buildId":"4oDSInv8WeDX6cVSprjyl","isFallback":false,"gsp":true,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
