After successfully deploying the fix([[Establish a Plan of Action]]), verify the system functionality over time.

- Are affected users happy with the solution?
- How can we ensure this problem is not repeated?
- Track the implemented solution over time(logs, monitoring solutions).
- Configuring log forwarding to the central host (this is important if you want to monitor aspects of your environment from a central location, a single management pane).
- Install software solutions for monitoring, such as, installing agents to track devices remotely.

Make sure if the problem has been resolved.

Consult an [[SME]]s if required.

Check if our solution has introduced any new problems? (it may show up in the long run if not immediately after the fix has been deployed, which is why monitoring is important).

Put preventative measures into effect.
