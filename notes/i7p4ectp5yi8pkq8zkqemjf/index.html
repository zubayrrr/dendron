<blockquote>
<p>Children should be kept from all kinds of instructions that may make errors possible until their sixteenth year, that is to say, from philosophy, religion, and general views of every description; because it is the errors that are acquired in early days that remain, as a rule, ineradicable, and because the faculty of judgment is the last to arrive at maturity. — Schopenhauer, On Education</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Observation(Experience) —> Learning</p>
<ul>
<li>Schopenhauer says that humans in their natural state learn from their observations/experience, the observation precedes learning, learning doesn't happen before experience.</li>
<li>When learning happens in this way, there is a clear link between the idea and the experience (or the application of the idea).</li>
<li>Schopenhauer calls traditional education as "Artificail education" in which the idea preceds experience.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>...artifical education is having one's head crammed full of idea, derived from hearing others talk, from learning and reading, before one has anything like an extensive knowledge of the world as it is and as one sees it.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>The problem with this approach is that when you try to apply an idea before you have the necessary experience, you apply the idea wrongly. Schopenhauer calls this as "perversion".</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>And so it is that education perverts the mind; and this is why, after a long spell of learning and reading, we enter the world, in our youth, with view that are partly simple, partly perverted...This is because our head is full of ideas which we're now trying to make use of, but almost always apply wrongly.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>The teacher is busy trying to cram ideas inside the children's mind instead of teaching them how to think in the first place; this causes children to grow up with ideas they learned from hearsay and opinions and are left unarmed to deal with situations in the real world(out of the textbook).</li>
<li>The children are submerged in a web of ideas based on opinions and prejudice; they grow up to find this conflicting with the real world, they face a cognitive dissonance and due to them never being taught how to change their opinions in the light of new evidence or facts they lash out against the world or the idea of it that was created for them in childhood.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>He has never attempted to abstract fundamental ideas from his own observations and experience, because he has got everything ready-made from other people; and it is for this very reason that he and countless others are so insipid and shallow.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Even if they're taught objectively correct things, they don't fully understand why they're so.</li>
<li>Schopenhauer puts a lot of importance in teaching children words and making sure they understand what those words really mean.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>...One must next take care that children do not use words with which they connect no clear meaning. Even children have, as a rule, that unhappy tendency of being satisfied with words instead of wishing to understand things, and of learning words by heart, so that they may make use of them when they're in a difficulty. This tendency clings to them afterwards, so that the knowledge of many learned men becomes mere verbosity.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Schopenhauer also proposes that before the age of sixteen children should only be taught things and subjects in which objective errors are possible(eg: Maths and Linguistics) and they shouldn't be taught things in which objective errors are not possible, matters of opinions, religion, philosophy et cetera.</li>
<li>Schopenhauer says this because he believes before the age of sixteen the faculty of judgement is not fully developed in a human, which makes it hard for him to make opinions of his own about matters as intricate as religion and philosophy thus he is also easily influenced if a ready-made answer is given to him.</li>
<li>Schopenhauer believes history must be taught but only stuff like dates and names of places and people...the added benefit of this is that since our memory is sharpest in our youth it behooves that we prioritize learning those things. He should soak up as much useful information as possible making good use of his youthful memory.</li>
<li>Schopenhauer believes that maturity should come with experience.</li>
<li>Its really important for us to interact/engage with the real world(when he says "engage", I think he means that we should try to apply our ideas to the real world).</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Instead, therefore, of hastening to place mere books in their hands, one should make them gradually acquainted with things and the circumstances of human life, and above everything one should take care to guide them to a clear grasp of reality, and to teach them to obtain their ideas directly from the real world, and to form them in keeping with it— but not to get them from elsewhere, as from books, fables, or what others have said...</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Those who learn everything from books lack common sense, we can go as far as to say that traditional education kills common sense.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>This why so few men of learning have such sound common sense as is quite common among the illiterate.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Children should spend time learning and knowing the real world, the sciences that govern the real world instead of spending time knowing books.</li>

Welcome to Noetic Noggin\n\nThis is [[my|archive.about]] personal wiki and a commonplace book; notes by me, for me.\n\n🚧 Permanently under construction 🚧\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/zubayr/image/upload/v1658499909/wiki/ajevkuyebljlxiblyst2.png)\n\nThis wiki was made possible with [dendron.so](https://dendron.so) and [obisidian.md](https://obsidian.md). Stored on [Github Repository](https://github.com/zubayrrr/dendron) and hosted on [Netlify](https://netlify.com) for free.\n\n## Principles\n\n### All notes should be relative to me.\n\n- All notes in principle are written for me; what I know about a subject, how I feel about a particular thing.\n- Opinions are fine as long as I feel strong epistemic confidence in the given opinion.\n- Don't over explain a note if it's not necessary, remember, these notes are for you and are relative to whatever knowledge you posses about the subject.\n- Read books and make an dedicated notes for them.\n- Listen podcasts but capture them inside a \"subject specific\" note or \"Map of Concept\" note or a note tagged #areas. Because making notes from podcasts can be tedious as they're not as well structured as books for consumption.(Whose merit is debatable.)\n- #areas are basically \"Map of Concept\" notes but I have recently come to the realization that its better to maintain them [Nikita Voloboev style](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/) but with heavy usage of transclusion and backlinking.\n  - \"Resources\" should be first processed and then mentioned inside the note, otherwise they should be left in inbox.\n\n### Gotta capture 'em all\n\n- Hog whatever information tickles your pickle([anything that gratifies one's intellectual curiosity](https://news.ycombinator.com/newsguidelines.html)).\n- [[swipes]] are interesting/useful bits of... [[quotes|swipes.quotes]], [[excerpts|swipes.excerpts]], [[sayings|swipes.sayings]], [[phrases|swipes.phrases]]. Essentially, ideas, opinions that are swiped off from [[others|resources.people]].\n- Make no distinction between \"your\" ideas and ideas of \"others\", because if you vibe with an idea; it's already yours.\n- But also remember \"If you've time to consume, you've time to produce.\".\n- Use [raindrop.io](https://raindrop.io) to manage your URL bookmarks.\n- If you need to bookmark a webpage or an article all together, use [MarkDownload](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/markdownload-markdown-web/pcmpcfapbekmbjjkdalcgopdkipoggdi?hl=en-GB) to rip the entire page. Let's call it a [[webmark|inbox.webmark]]; it belong in the `/inbox`.\n- Similar process is employed for capturing tweets using [tweet-to-markdown](https://github.com/kbravh/tweet-to-markdown) and it also belongs in the `/inbox`.\n\n### Don't force evolution\n\n- Let your second brain evolve at it's own pace.\n- The structure should never be _too_ rigid because its meant to take form by itself.\n\n### Noise \u0026 Signal\n\n- While capturing ideas left and right is recommended, make sure you're not harming your periods of focus.\n- Have impenetrable focus periods (use Pomodoro method) where you only care about the work on hand and nothing else.\n\n### Why do any of this?\n\n- Because I can't remember everything - there's a lot of information around that interests me and there isn't enough working memory installed in me.\n- So, I make notes - to remember, to create, to meditate, to think.\n- A bodybuilder's portfolio is their body - my portfolio is my wiki.\n- Not only am I making - whatever I know - tangible by writing it down. I know exactly where to look if I ever forget something.\n- I am at the beginning of my learning adventures. When I look back at it, I will know where I came from and how my thoughts evolved over time.\n- Plus, its really fun to nerd out.\n\n## Structure of this wiki\n\n- [[slipbox.Ontology]] explains the structure of this wiki and the tags, backlinks used in it.\n- Dendron takes care of the structure and hierarchy(mostly), but I insist on using tags for backwards compatibility.\n\n## Quicklinks\n\n- [[About me|archive.about]]\n- [Github](https://github.com/zubayrrr)\n- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/zoobhalu)\n- [Blog](https://zubayrali.in)\n- [Guestbook](https://www.yourworldoftext.com/~zubayrali/)\n"},"collectionChildren":null,"customHeadContent":null,"config":{"version":5,"dev":{"enablePreviewV2":true,"enableSelfContainedVaults":true},"commands":{"lookup":{"note":{"selectionMode":"extract","confirmVaultOnCreate":true,"vaultSelectionModeOnCreate":"smart","leaveTrace":false,"bubbleUpCreateNew":true,"fuzzThreshold":0.2}},"randomNote":{},"insertNoteLink":{"aliasMode":"none","enableMultiSelect":false},"insertNoteIndex":{"enableMarker":false},"copyNoteLink":{},"templateHierarchy":"template","insertNote":{"initialValue":"templates"}},"workspace":{"vaults":[{"fsPath":".","selfContained":true,"name":"Dendron"}],"journal":{"dailyDomain":"daily","name":"journal","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd","addBehavior":"childOfDomain"},"scratch":{"name":"scratch","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd.HHmmss","addBehavior":"asOwnDomain"},"task":{"name":"task","dateFormat":"y.MM.dd","addBehavior":"asOwnDomain","statusSymbols":{"":" ","wip":"w","done":"x","assigned":"a","moved":"m","blocked":"b","delegated":"l","dropped":"d","pending":"y"},"taskCompleteStatus":["done","x"],"prioritySymbols":{"H":"high","M":"medium","L":"low"},"todoIntegration":false,"createTaskSelectionType":"selection2link"},"graph":{"zoomSpeed":1,"createStub":false},"enableAutoCreateOnDefinition":false,"enableHandlebarTemplates":true,"enableXVaultWikiLink":false,"enableRemoteVaultInit":true,"enableUserTags":true,"enableHashTags":true,"workspaceVaultSyncMode":"noCommit","enableAutoFoldFrontmatter":false,"enableEditorDecorations":true,"maxPreviewsCached":10,"maxNoteLength":204800,"enableFullHierarchyNoteTitle":false,"enableSmartRefs":true},"preview":{"enableFMTitle":true,"enableNoteTitleForLink":true,"enableFrontmatterTags":true,"enableHashesForFMTags":false,"enableMermaid":true,"enablePrettyRefs":true,"enableKatex":true,"automaticallyShowPreview":false},"publishing":{"theme":"dark","enableFMTitle":true,"enableNoteTitleForLink":true,"enableMermaid":true,"enablePrettyRefs":true,"enableKatex":true,"copyAssets":true,"siteHierarchies":["root"],"writeStubs":false,"siteRootDir":"docs","seo":{"title":"Noetic Noggin","description":"Personal Wiki / Digital Garden","author":"Zubayr Ali","twitter":"zoobhalu"},"github":{"enableEditLink":false,"editLinkText":"Edit this page on GitHub","editBranch":"main","editViewMode":"tree"},"enableSiteLastModified":true,"enableFrontmatterTags":true,"enableHashesForFMTags":false,"enableRandomlyColoredTags":true,"enableTaskNotes":true,"enablePrettyLinks":true,"siteUrl":"localhost:3000","siteFaviconPath":"favicon.ico","siteIndex":"root"}}},"__N_SSG":true},"page":"/notes/[id]","query":{"id":"i7p4ectp5yi8pkq8zkqemjf"},"buildId":"4oDSInv8WeDX6cVSprjyl","isFallback":false,"gsp":true,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
