The SIGKILL [[devlog.signal]]is sent to a [[devlog.process]] to cause it to terminate immediately ([[devlog.kill]]). In contrast to [[SIGTERM]] and [[SIGINT]], this signal cannot be caught or ignored, and the receiving process cannot perform any clean-up upon receiving this signal.

- Also known as `hard kill`
