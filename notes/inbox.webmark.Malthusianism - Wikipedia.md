**Malthusianism** is the idea that [population growth is potentially exponential](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malthusian_growth_model "Malthusian growth model") while the growth of the [food supply](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_supply "Food supply") or other [resources](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resources "Resources") is [linear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_growth "Linear growth"), which eventually reduces living standards to the point of triggering a [population die off](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depopulation "Depopulation"). This event, called a **Malthusian catastrophe** (also known as a **Malthusian trap**, **population trap**, **Malthusian check**, **Malthusian crisis**, **Malthusian spectre**, or **Malthusian crunch**) occurs when [population growth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_growth "Population growth") outpaces [agricultural](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agriculture "Agriculture") [production](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Production_(economics) "Production (economics)"), causing [famine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Famine "Famine") or [war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War "War"), resulting in poverty and depopulation. Such a catastrophe inevitably has the effect of forcing the population (quite rapidly, due to the potential severity and unpredictable results of the mitigating factors involved, as compared to the relatively slow time scales and well-understood processes governing [unchecked growth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_growth "Population growth") or growth affected by preventive checks) to "correct" back to a lower, more easily sustainable level.[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malthusianism#cite_note-intellectual_roots-1)[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malthusianism#cite_note-Barrons-2) Malthusianism has been linked to a variety of political and social movements, but almost always refers to advocates of [population control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_control "Population control").
