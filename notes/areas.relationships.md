## Notes

- Be an extreme version of yourself(don't try to not be a nerd, embrace that) - and ask out a lot of people.
- People who are perpetually single are trying to date the small number of people that everyone else is trying to date
- It's not lowering your standards, it's changing what your standards consists of. You're optimizing for the wrong parameters. You're wanting things that are not going to aid your goal of long term relationship.
  - By doing this you're opening yourself up to an untapped new market with less competition that could bring happiness.
- Take advantage of the [[archive.similarity bias]] - similar traits are attractive.
  - We're 11.3% more likely to match with someone who shares our initials.
