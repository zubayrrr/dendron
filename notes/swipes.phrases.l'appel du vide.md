L'appel du vide (French: lit., "the call of the void"): The instinctive urge to jump from high places. "When you're walking on the edge of a cliff and you get a sudden urge to jump ... it is a very peculiar sensation. Most people have had this experience because it means a sudden sense that you cannot trust your own instincts."
