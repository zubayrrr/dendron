- TELNET came out before [[devlog.ssh]]
- TELNET does what [[devlog.ssh]] does but insecurely, it doesn't encrypt the data transferred.
- Operates on Port 23
- Provides bidirectional interactive text-oriented communication facility using a virtual terminal connection. (Remote access via Command Line/Terminal)
