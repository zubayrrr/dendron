> Have you ever needed to automate interacting with your notes? This plugin gives Obsidian a REST API you can interact with your notes from other tools so you can automate what you need to automate.
> 
> This plugin provides a secure HTTPS interface gated behind api key authentication that allows you to:
> 
> -   Read, create, update or delete existing notes. There's even a `PATCH` HTTP method for inserting content into a particular section of a note.
> -   List notes stored in your vault.
> -   Create and fetch periodic notes.
> -   Execute commands and list what commands are available.
> 
> This is particularly useful if you need to interact with Obsidian from a browser extension like [Obsidian Web](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/obsidian-web/edoacekkjanmingkbkgjndndibhkegad).
