> "I want to learn more and more to see as beautiful what is necessary in things; then I shall be one of those who makes things beautiful. [[Amor fati]] let that be my love henceforth! I do not want to wage war against what is ugly. I do not want to accuse; I do not even want to accuse those who accuse. Looking away shall be my only negation. And all in all and on the whole: some day I wish to be only a Yes-sayer." â€” section 276 of [[The Gay Science]], [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]
