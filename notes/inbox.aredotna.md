The Secret

**Allow yourself to go down rabbit holes**

A rabbit hole is not a distraction. A rabbit hole is your brain trying to tell you to pay attention to something you’re curious about. Ignore algorithmic rabbit holes.

**If you see something, save something**

Pay attention to what feels resonant to you. Save breadcrumbs and build a path for yourself to walk down later on. The ability to classify information in a personal way is a muscle worth exercising.

**“Creativity is just connecting things”**

Over time, build contexts for yourself and your ideas. Analyze what happens when you connect those contexts to someone else’s.

**Remember**

The goal is not self-improvement. The goal is engaging more deeply with the World.
